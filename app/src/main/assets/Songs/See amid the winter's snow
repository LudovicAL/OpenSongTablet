.G    Am G/B  C        G          D   C  G     A7  D
 See amid the winter’s snow, born for us on earth below,
.G        Am  G/B C     G D/F# Em       G     C   D   G
 See, the Lamb of God appears, promised from eternal years.

[C]
.           C/G G D7  G  D
 Hail, thou ever-blessed morn!
.G/B     C  G      Am G/B  D
 Hail, redemption’s happy dawn!
.Em           A7  D Em A7 D
 Sing through all Jerusalem,
.G         C       G/D D  G
 Christ is born in Bethlehem!

[V2]
.G       Am G/B C      G       D   C     G   A7     D
 Lo, within a   manger lies He who built the starry skies,
.G       Am      G/B C        G D/F# Em    G   C   D    G
 He who, throned in  height sublime, sits amid the cherubim.

[V3]
.G       Am G/B  C         G         D    C  G   A7   D
 Say, ye holy    shepherd, say, what your joyful news today;
.G         Am  G/B C         G D/F# Em     G  C   D        G
 Wherefore have ye left your sheep  on the lonely mountain steep?

[V4]
.G     Am      G/B C        G          D  C   G A7       D
 As we watched at  dread of night, lo, we saw a wondrous light:
.G      Am G/B   C        G D/F#  Em      G  C   D         G
 Angels singing ‘Peace on earth’, told us of the Saviour’s birth.

[V5]
.G      Am G/B  C     G          D C  G   A7       D
 Sacred infant, all divine, what a tender love was Thine,
.G       Am   G/B  C       G D/F# Em      G    C D        G
 Thus to come from highest bliss  down to such a world as this!

[V6]
.G        Am    G/B  C    G         D   C    G  A7       D
 Teach, O teach us,  holy child, by Thy face so meek and mild,
.G        Am G/B C    G D/F# Em     G     C D   G
 Teach us to resemble Thee   in Thy sweet humility.</lyrics>

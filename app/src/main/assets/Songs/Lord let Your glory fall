.G         D/F#       C/E   G/B                C
 Lord, let Your glory fall, as on that ancient day;
.Em          Bm    C     Am       G/B  C     G
 Songs of enduring love, and then Your glory came.
.G        D/F#    C/E  G/B                    C
 And as a sign to You, that we would love the same,
.Em              Bm        C     Am       G/B  C     G
 Our hearts will sing that song: God, let Your glory come.
 
[C]
.        G/B                                 C
 You are good, Your are good and Your love endures.
.        G/B                                 C
 You are good, Your are good and Your love endures.
.        Em             Bm
 You are good, Your are good
.         C              G   C (to finish: G)
 And Your love endures today.
 
[V2]
 Voices in unison, giving You thanks and praise,
 Joined by the instruments, and then Your glory came.
 Your presence like a cloud, upon that ancient day,
 The priests were overwhelmed, because Your glory came.
 
[V3]
 A sacrifice was made, and then Your fire came;
 They knelt upon the ground, and with one voice they praised.
 A sacrifice was made, and then Your fire came;
 They knelt upon the ground, and with one voice they praised.</lyrics>

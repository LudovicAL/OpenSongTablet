  <lyrics>[V1]
.    G                 D
 We bow our hearts, we lift our hands,
.   Em7              C
 We turn our eyes to You again,
.    G              D
 And we surrender to the truth
.     Em7                C
 That all we need is found in You.
 
[C]
.             G      D          Em       Em7 C
 Receive our adoration, Jesus, Lamb of God.
.             G      D             Em     Em7 C
 Receive our adoration; how wonderful You are.
 
[V2]
 We choose to leave it all behind
 And turn our eyes towards the prize.
 The upward call of God in Christ;
 You have our hearts, Lord; take our lives.
 
[B]
.                  D     Dsus4 D
 Every soul You've saved sings out.
.                  C      G
 Everything You've made resounds.
.               D   Dsus4 D              C
 All creation's standing now, lifting up Your name.
.                        D Dsus4 D
 We're caught up in the angel's song.
.                       C       G
 We're gathered to Your ancient throne.
.                D Dsus4  D              C
 Children in our Father's arms, shouting out Your praise.</lyrics></song>

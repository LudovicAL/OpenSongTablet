.Bb                       F        Eb Bb
 Low in the grave He lay, Jesus my Savior!
.Eb          Bb          Gm/Bb C      F
 Waiting the coming day, Je____sus my Lord!

[C]
.            Bb
 (Spirited!) Up from the grave He arose,
.              Cm               Bb
 With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
.    F                      Gm   Eb Bb
 He arose a victor from the dark do_main,
.       Eb       C             F      C7/G F/A
 And He lives forever with His saints to   reign,
.    Bb        Eb         Bb     F       Bb
 He arose! He arose! Hallelujah! Christ arose!

[V2]
.Bb                         F        Eb Bb
 Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus my Savior!
.Eb          Bb             Gm/Bb C      F
 Vainly they seal the dead, Je____sus my Lord!

[V3]
.Bb                          F        Eb Bb
 Death cannot keep his prey, Jesus my Savior!
.Eb          Bb         Gm/Bb C      F
 He tore the bars away, Je____sus my Lord!</lyrics>

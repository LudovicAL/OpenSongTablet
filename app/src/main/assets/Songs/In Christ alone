.E     E/A    E    A    B   E/G#  A E/G# F#m B E
 (as last two lines of verse)

[V]
.      E/A      E          A       B      E/G#         A      E/G# F#m   B       E
1In    Christ   alone my   hope is found,|He is my     light, my   strength, my song;
2In    Christ   alone! who took on flesh |Fullness of  God    in   helpless     babe!
3There in the   ground His body    lay,  |Light of the world  by   darkness     slain
4No    guilt in life, no   fear in death,|This is the  power  of   Christ  in   me;

.     E/A          E        A        B.    E/G#             A        B           E
1This Corner___stone,  this solid  ground,|Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.||
2This gift of      love and righteousness,|Scorned by the   ones He  came to     save:||
3Then bursting     forth in glorious day, |Up from the      grave He rose       again!||
4From life’s first cry to   final  breath,|Jesus         commands my destiny.||

.     E/G#       A           C#m       B           E/G#      A             C#m       B
1What heights of love, what depths of peace,|When  fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
2Till on that    cross as   Jesus     died, |The   wrath of  God was       satisfied –
3And  as He      stands in  victor_____y    |Sin’s curse has lost its      grip on   me,
4No   power of   hell, no   scheme of man,  |Can   ever      pluck me      from His hand;

.     E/A   E       A        B     E/G#            A     E/G# F#m B      E
1My   Comforter, my All in   All, |Here in the     love  of   Christ I   stand.
2For  every sin on  Him was  laid;|Here in the     death of   Christ I   live.
3For  I am  His and He is    mine,|Bought with the precious   blood of   Christ.
4Till He returns or calls me home,|Here in the     power of   Christ I’ll stand!
 
[Outro]
.   E/G#     A        C#m       B        E/G# A        C#m      B
 No power of hell, no scheme of man,|Can ever pluck me from His hand;
.     E/A  E        A        B     E/G#        A     E/G# F#m B        E
 Till He returns or calls me home,|Here in the power of   Christ I’ll stand!

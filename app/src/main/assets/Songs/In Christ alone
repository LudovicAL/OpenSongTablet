  <lyrics>[Intro]
.D     D/G    D    G    A
.D/F#  G D/F# Em A D  (2 beats)

[V1]
.   D/G     D       G       A
 In Christ alone my hope is found,
.D/F#     G      D/F# Em   A       D
 He is my light, my   strength, my song;
.     D/G   D           G     A
 This Cornerstone, this solid ground,
.D/F#             G        A           D
 Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.||
.     D/F#       G           Bm        A
 What heights of love, what depths of peace,
.     D/F#      G             Bm        A
 When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
.   D/G   D       G      A
 My Comforter, my All in All,
.D/F#        G    D/F# Em A     D   (2 beats)
 Here in the love of   Christ I stand.

[V2]
.   D/G     D           G       A
 In Christ alone! - who took on flesh,
.D/F#        G   D/F# Em  A    D
 Fullness of God in   helpless babe!
.     D/G     D        G        A
 This gift of love and righteousness,
.D/F#           G       A       D
 Scorned by the ones He came to save:||
.     D/F#    G        Bm    A
 Till on that cross as Jesus died,
.    D/F#     G       Bm   A
 The wrath of God was satisfied –
.    D/G   D      G       A
 For every sin on Him was laid; 
.D/F#        G     D/F# Em A     D   (2 beats)
 Here in the death of   Christ I live.
;INTRO

[V3]
.      D/G    D          G    A
 There in the ground His body lay,
.D/F#         G     D/F# Em  A    D
 Light of the world by   darkness slain:
.     D/G      D        G        A
 Then bursting forth in glorious day,
.D/F#        G        A     D
 Up from the grave He rose again!||
.    D/F#  G         Bm   A
 And as He stands in victory
.      D/F#      G        Bm      A
 Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me,
.    D/G  D       G     A
 For I am His and He is mine,
.D/F#            G  D/F#  Em A     D   (2 beats)
 Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

[V4]
.   D/G      D        G       A
 No guilt in life, no fear in death,
.D/F#        G     D/F# Em  A     D
 This is the power of   Christ in me;
.     D/G          D      G     A
 From life’s first cry to final breath,
.D/F#    G         A    D
 Jesus commands my destiny.||
.   D/F#     G        Bm        A
 No power of hell, no scheme of man,
.    D/F# G        Bm       A
 Can ever pluck me from His hand;
.     D/G  D        G        A
 Till He returns or calls me home,
.D/F#        G     D/F# Em A        D   (2 beats)
 Here in the power of   Christ I’ll stand!

[Outro]
.   D/F#     G        Bm        A
 No power of hell, no scheme of man,
.    D/F# G        Bm       A
 Can ever pluck me from His hand;
.     D/G  D        G        A
 Till He returns or calls me home,
.D/F#        G     D/F# Em A        D
 Here in the power of   Christ I’ll stand!</lyrics>

.G        D/F# G   Em D    G
 Come, ye thankful people, come,
.G         D/F# G  Em Am/C B
 Raise the song of harvest home:
.Em     Am     D        G
 All is safely gathered in,
.    Am/E D/F# Em/G  D/A   A7 D   
 Ere the  winter    storms begin;
.          D/C G/B  D7/A G
 God our Maker doth provide
.              G/F C/E G7/D C
 For our needs to  be  supplied;
.E       Am        D       G
 Come to God's own temple, come,
.C         G/B  Em G/D D7  G
 Raise the song of harvest home!
 
[V2]
 All the world is God's own field,
 Fruit unto His praise to yield;
 Wheat and tares together sown,
 Unto joy or sorrow grown;
 First the blade, and then the ear,
 Then the full corn shall appear;
 Lord of harvest, grant that we
 Wholesome grain and pure may be.
 
[V3]
 For the Lord our God shall come,
 And shall take His harvest home;
 From His field shall in that day
 All offences purge away;
 Give His angels charge at last
 In the fire the tares to cast:
 But the fruitful ears to store
 In His garner evermore.
 
[V4]
 Even so, Lord, quickly come
 To Thy final harvest home,
 Gather Thou Thy people in,
 Free from sorrow, free from sin;
 There for ever purified,
 In Thy presence to abide:
 Come, with all Thine angels, come;
 Raise the glorious harvest home.</lyrics>

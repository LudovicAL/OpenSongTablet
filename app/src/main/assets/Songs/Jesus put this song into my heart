 Jesus taught us how to live in harmony
 Jesus taught us how to live in harmony
 Different faces, different races, He made us one
 Jesus taught us how to live in harmony

[V3]
 Jesus taught us how to be a family
 Jesus taught us how to be a family
 Loving one another with the love that He gives
 Jesus taught us how to be a family

 Jesus turned our sorrow into dancing
 Jesus turned our sorrow into dancing
 Changed our tears of sadness into rivers of joy
 Jesus turned our sorrows into a dance</lyrics>

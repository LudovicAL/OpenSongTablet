.F/A   Bb2   F/A   Bb2
 
[V]
.        F                Bb2
 Here is love, vast as the ocean
.       F               C
 Loving kindness as the flood
.         F/A                 Bb2
 When the prince of life, our ransom
.         F      C/E      F
 Shed for us his precious blood
 
[C]
.        F/A             Gm
 Who his love will not remember
.        C                 F
 Who can cease to sing his praise?
.       Dm7         Bb
 He can never be forgotten
.           F       C/E     F
 Throughout heavens eternal days
 
[V2]
 On the mount of crucifixion
 Fountains opened deep and wide
 Through the floodgates of God's mercy
 Flowed a vast and gracious tide
 
[C2]
 Grace and love like mighty rivers
 Poured incessant from above
 And heavens peace and perfect justice
 Kissed a guilty world in love
 
[B]
.F                 Bb2
 No love is higher, no love is wider
.F/A               Bb2
 No love is deeper, no love is truer
.F                 Bb2
 No love is higher, no love is wider
.F/A                  Bb2
 No love is like your love, O Lord</lyrics></song>

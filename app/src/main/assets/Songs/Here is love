  <lyrics>[Intro]
.G/B   C2   G/B   C2
 
[V]
.        G                C2
 Here is love, vast as the ocean
.       G               D
 Loving kindness as the flood
.         G/B                 C2
 When the prince of life, our ransom
.         G      D/F#      G
 Shed for us his precious blood
 
[C]
.        G/B             D
 Who his love will not remember
.        D/F#              G
 Who can cease to sing his praise?
.       Em7         C
 He can never be forgotten
.           G       D/F#     G
 Throughout heavens eternal days
 
[V2]
 On the mount of crucifixion, fountains opened deep and wide
 Through the floodgates of God's mercy, flowed a vast and gracious tide
 
[C2]
 Grace and love like mighty rivers poured incessant from above
 And heavens peace and perfect justice, kissed a guilty world in love

[V3]
 In Your truth, Your love directs me, by Your Spirit, through Your Word
 And Your grace my need is meeting, as I trust in You my Lord

[C3]
 From Your fullness You are pouring Your great love and power on me,
 Without measure, full and boundless, drawing out my heart to Thee

[V4]
 Let me all Your love accepting, love You ever, all my days
 Let me seek Your kingdom only and my life be to Your praise

[C4]
 You alone shall be my glory, nothing in the world I see
 You have cleansed and sanctified me, Jesus You have set me free

[B]
.G                 C2
 No love is higher, no love is wider
.G/B               C2
 No love is deeper, no love is truer
.G                 C2
 No love is higher, no love is wider
.G/B                  C2
 No love is like your love, O Lord

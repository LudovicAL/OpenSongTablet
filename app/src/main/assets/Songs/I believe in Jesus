.E A           B7
 I  believe in Jesus |(I believe in You) 
.E             A             B7
 I  believe He is the Son of God |(He is the Son of God)
.E             A        B7
 I  believe He died and rose again |(Died and rose again) 
.E             A           B7
 I  believe He paid for us all |(He paid for us all) 

[C1]
.A       B7          E            E7            A
 And I believe He is here now |(I believe He is here) 
.B7              E    E7
 Standing in our midst  
.A             B7       E                   E7       A
 Here with the power to heal now |(With the power to heal)
.        B7            E    A  B7  E
 And the grace to forgive

[V2]
 I  believe in You, Lord |(I believe in You) 
 I  believe You are the Son of God |(You are the Son of God)
 I  believe You died and rose again |(Died and rose again) 
 I  believe You paid for us all |(You paid for us all)

[C2]
 And I believe You are here now |(I believe You are here) 
 Standing in our midst
 Here with the power to heal now |(With the power to heal) 
 And the grace to forgive</lyrics>

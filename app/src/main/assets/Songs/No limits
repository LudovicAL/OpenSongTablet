  <lyrics>[Intro]
.E    E/G#    A    F#m   x2
 
[V1]
 This is my prayer, 
 That you would bless me
 This is my prayer, 
 That your hand be with me 
 
[V2]
 This is my prayer, 
 From evil you keep me, Lord
 This is my prayer 
 That it will not grieve 
 Enlarge my territory
 
[C]
.   E          E/G#
 No limits, no boundries
.      A            F#m
 I see increase all around me
.        E            G#7
 Stretch forth, break forth 
.   A
 Release me 
.  F#m      B      E
 Enlarge my territory
 
 
[T]
.E                    F#7
 Take the limits off, take the limits off
.   Gmaj7            F#m7
 Release me, release me!
 (repeat x3)
.E                    F#7
 Take the limits off, take the limits off
.  G7          A
 Release me, release me!</lyrics></song>

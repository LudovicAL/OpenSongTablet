 Shout Alleluia, sing everyone!

[V2]
 Jesus our Saviour, came from His Father
 Lived here among us, joined in our fun.
 Showed us He loved us, died for us gladly;
 Shout Alleluia, sing everyone!

[V3]
 Though the disciples turned away children
 Jesus rebuked them, and he said 'come'.
 Put His arms round them, gave them His blessing;
 Shout Alleluia, sing everyone!

[V4]
 Light your Christingle, think of the Saviour,
 Born in a stable, how the star shone!
 Jesus is with us, Light in the darkness;
 Shout Alleluia, sing everyone!

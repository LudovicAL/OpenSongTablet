.Bb               F/A                 Eb           
 Turn your ear to heaven and hear the noise inside
.    Bb                        F/A           
 The sound of angel's awe, the sound of angel songs 
.Eb                   Cm
 All this for a King, we could join and sing
.Eb
 All to Christ our King

[B1]
.F                 Eb      F                      Eb
 How constant, how divine, this song of ours will rise.
.F                 Eb      F                      Eb  
 How constant, how divine, this love of ours will rise, will rise...

[C1]
.Bb            F/A
 O praise Him, O praise Him, 
.Gm          Eb    Cm
 He is Holy, He is Holy

[V2]
 Turn your gaze to heaven and raise a joyous noise
 The sound of salvation come, the sound of rescued ones
 All this for a King, angels join to sing
 All for Christ our King

[B2]
 How infinite and sweet, this love so rescuing
 How infinitely sweet this great love that has redeemed, as one we sing

[C2]
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
 He is Holy, He is Holy</lyrics></song>

.F#m                 D2         A/C#          Esus
 Crown Him with many crowns the Lamb upon His throne
.     F#m     Esus     B/D#   E          E/B   B       Esus
 Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own
.A/C#              D2      B                Esus  E
 Awake my soul and sing of Him who died for me
.    F#m      E      D2        A/C#         Bm7 E7sus A
 And hail Him as Thy matchless King through all eternity
 
[C]
.D2        A/C#              D2             F#m      Esus
 Majesty!  Lord of all!  Let every throne before Him fall!
.    D2               A/C#           Bm7     A/C#       Esus   A
 The King of kings, O come adore our God who reigns for evermore!  (for evermore!)
 
[V2]
.F#m                    D2       A/C#               Esus
 Crown Him, The Lord of life who triumphed o'er the grave
.     F#m    Esus    B/D#   E          E/B      B       Esus
 And rose victorious in the strife for those He came to save
.    A/C#           D2        B                Esus  E
 His glories now we sing, who died and rose on high
.    F#m   E      D2      A/C#      Bm7        E7sus     A
 Who died eternal life to bring and lives that death may die

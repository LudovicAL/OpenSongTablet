.B                                      
 Follow the star to a place unexpected, 
.G#m                                            E
 Would you believe after all we’ve projected, a child in a manger
.B
 Lowly and small, the weakest of all
.  G#m                                     E
 Unlikeliness hero, wrapped in his mothers shawl, just a child
.                         F# (ring out)
 Is this who we’ve waited for?

[C]
.B
 How many kings, stepped down from their thrones?
.G#m
 How many lords have abandoned their homes?
.E                                          F# (1/2 bar)
 How many greats have become the least for me?
.B
 How many Gods have poured out their hearts
.G#m
 To romance a world that has torn all apart?
.E                                       F#
 How many fathers gave up their sons for me?

[V2]
.B
 Bringing our gifts for the newborn savior
.G#m                                         E
 All that we have whether costly or meek, because we believe
.B 
 Gold for his honor and frankincense for his pleasure
.G#m                                   E
 And myrrh for the cross he’ll suffer, do you believe, 
.                         F#
 Is this who we’ve waited for?   (It's who we've waited for...)

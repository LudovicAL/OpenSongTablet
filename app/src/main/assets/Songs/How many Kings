  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                                      
 Follow the star to a place unexpected, 
.Em                                            Am
 Would you believe after all we’ve projected, a child in a manger
.G
 Lowly and small, the weakest of all
.  Em                                     Am
 Unlikeliness hero, wrapped in his mothers shawl, just a child
.                         D (ring out)
 Is this who we’ve waited for?

[C]
.G
 How many kings, stepped down from their thrones?
.Em
 How many lords have abandoned their homes?
.Am                                       D (1/2 bar)
 How many greats have become the least for me?
.G
 How many Gods have poured out their hearts
.   Em
 To romance a world that has torn all apart?
.Am                                     D
 How many fathers gave up their sons for me?

[V2]
.G
 Bringing our gifts for the newborn saviour
.Em                                        Am
 All that we have whether costly or meek, because we believe
.G                                            (Em)
 Gold for his honour and frankincense for his pleasure
.Em                                   Am
 And myrrh for the cross he’ll suffer, do you believe, 
.                         D
 Is this who we’ve waited for?   (It's who we've waited for...)

[C]

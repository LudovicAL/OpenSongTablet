 Lord how majestic You are

 My eyes meet Your gaze and my burden is lifted

 Your word is a lamp to my feet 
.     Asus          A              E/A      Bm7  (D/E)
 Your hand swift to bless and Your banner a shield

 To  You  I   bow,the King who commands my every breath

 The man who has conquered sin and death,

 Lord how resplendent You are
.       Asus          A            E/A          Bm7/A
 When I think of Your heavens, the work of Your fingers
.        A                 Asus       A
 What is man, that You are mindful of Him
.           Asus             A         E/A           Bm7  (D/E)
 Yet You've crowned him with glory and caused him to reign

  <lyrics>[C]
.D          G/B    Em6 D/F#  Bm
 All things bright and beautiful,
.    A/C# A/E  D/E   E7  A
 All creatures great and small,
.D          G/B  A7  D/F#  Bm
 All things wise and wonderful,
.Em  D/F# Bm  D/A  A7   D 
 The Lord God made them all.

[V1]
.     A      Bm     E7   A
 Each little flower that opens,
.D    A/C# F#m A/E  E7   A
 Each little   bird that sings,
.F#7 Bm/F# F#    Bm      E7 F#m
 He  made  their glowing colours,
.D  A/E        E7   A
 He made their tiny wings.

[V2]
 The purple-headed mountain,
 The river running by,
 The sunset, and the morning
 That brightens up the sky.

[V3]
 The cold wind in the winter,
 The pleasant summer sun,
 The ripe fruits in the garden,
 He made them every one.

[V4]
 He gave us eyes to see them,
 And lips that we might tell
 How great is God Almighty,
 Who has made all things well.</lyrics>

.G Em        Am7  D  
 Father, we adore You, 
.G           Em                Am7   D
 We are Your children gathered here
.   Am      D      G     C    G/B
 To be with You is our delight, 
.Am        Am7     D
 A feast beyond compare.
 
[C]
.            G           C
 You are the Fountain of life,
.            Am7         D
 You are the Fountain of life,
.          Bm7           E7             Am
 And as we drink; we are more than satisfied
.          D7          C    D
 By You, O Fountain of life
 
[V2]
 Father, in Your presence
 There is such freedom to enjoy.
 We find in You a lasting peace
 That nothing can destroy.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.     D                            Bm9
 When deep calls to deep|There's a stirring inside of me,
.  Gmaj9                       D2/F#
 A feeling that words won't describe,||
.         D                 Bm9
 Like I'm hearing Your song|Touching my spirit,
.Gmaj9                  D   C2
 Calling me deeper with You.

[V2]
.        D                         Bm9            
 And the thirst in my soul|Just to meet with You, God,
.    Gmaj9                    D2/F#
 I'm feeling the pull of Your love,||
.         D                             Bm9
 Like the crash of Your waves,|Like the roar of Your waterfalls,
.Gmaj9              D    D   
 Drawing me on into You.

[B]
.    C2    G/B          D  
 And all I know is it's You.
.    C2    G/B    A7sus4 A
 And I cry out to You.

[C]
.        D                          C2            
 Give me oil for my wounds,|Give me wine for my heart,
.        G                       Gm/Bb
 Give me strength for today,|And I will stand.||
.        D                          C2
 Give me salve for my eyes,|Give me truth for the lies,
.        G                   Gm/Bb              A7sus4  A  (D)
 Give me love in my life|And I will run with You.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[C]
.          A               F#m
 A love so dear, a love so strong
.          D                E
 A love so freely, You have shown
.            A                    F#m
 A love much more, than my life deserves
.              D                   E
 Your love for me, on that cross revealed


[V1]
.F#m         E                A2                D
 You are the King of old, the glorious Lamb of God
.Bm          E             A2             D
 Revealed in all creation, Seated on Your throne
.F#m          E             A2               D
 Yet You have chosen me, by death You have redeemed
.Bm            E                 D                E
 The blood you shed for me, That love revealed to me

[B]
.    D                    F#m
 And I'll never know, the pain that you bore
.       E                           F#m
 As the Father turned away from His Son
.    D                        F#m
 The shame that You bore, the sin it was mine
.        E                       E/G#
 Yet you died there for me, Your love set me free

 The wonder of Your mercy Lord
 The beauty of Your grace
 That You would even pardon me,
 And bring me to this place||
 I stand before Your Holiness
 I can only stand amazed
 The sinless Saviour died to make
 A covenant of grace

[V2]
 I only want to serve You
 Bring honour to Your name
 And though I've often failed You
 Your faithfulness remains||
 I'll glory in my weakness
 That I might know Your strength
 I will live my life at they cross of Christ
 And raise a banner to proclain

[V3]
 You welcome us before You
 Into this Holy place
 The brilliance of Your glory
 Demands our endless praise||
 The one, the only Saviour
 Has opened heaven's doors
 We can enter in, free from all our sin
 By Your cleansing sacrifice</lyrics></song>

.    E                              A      Bsus
 How lovely is your dwelling place,|O Lord Almighty
.E                                 Bsus
 My soul longs and even faints for you
.    E                           A           Bsus
 For here my heart is satisfied,|Within your presence
.  E                               Bsus
 I sing beneath the shadow of your wings
 
[C]
.          A2                                Bsus
 Better is one day in your courts,|Better is one day in your house
.          A2                                    Bsus
 Better is one day in your courts|Than thousands elsewhere
.          A2                                Bsus
 Better is one day in your courts,|Better is one day in your house
.          A2                                    Bsus
 Better is one day in your courts|Than thousands elsewhere
.                E
 Than a thousand elsewhere
 
[V2]
 One thing I ask and I would seek, to see your beauty
 To find you in the place your glory dwells
 One thing I ask and I would seek, to see your beauty
 To find you in the place your glory dwells

.C#m7                   Bsus A2                 Bsus
 My heart and flesh cry out,|For you the living God
.C#m7                Bsus   A2     Bsus
 Your spirit's water for my soul
.C#m7                 Bsus  A2
 I've tasted and I've seen,|Come once again to me
.C#m7                     A2                  A2/F#m
 I will draw near to you,|I will draw near to you

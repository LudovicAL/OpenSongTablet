. A  E  D  F#m  E
 
[V1]
.          A           D      E    A
 There's a song that's rising up inside
.         A    D      E
 It’s the overflow of praise
.     F#m     E           D     A/C#
 Your joy has filled this heart again
.   Bm   F#m     E
 No I am not the same
.         Bm     F#m          E
 You have turned sorrow into praise
 
[C]
.   A       D             F#m            E
 We celebrate,|You’ve put dancing in our hearts
.   A      D                  F#m              E
 We celebrate,|For all you’ve done and who you are||
.             A/C# D      F#m             E
 We lift your name, |High above all other name
.        A/C#    D          E
 You are Lord of heaven and earth
 
[V2]
 For the battle has already been won
 Even death you overcame
 We crown you King of glory now
 You reign victoriously
 We declare your majesty
 
[B]
.     A/C#        D            F#m          E
 I’ll dance, I’ll sing,|Giving glory to the King
.     A/C#         D             E
 I’ll praise, Your name,|For you reign (x2)||
.      A/C#         D            F#m          E
 We’ll dance, We’ll Sing,|Giving glory to the King
.       A/C#       D             E
 We’ll Praise your name,|For you reign</lyrics></song>

.G            D7       G         C         G         D
 Blest be the tie that binds uur hearts in Christian love;
.       D7  G      D/F# D7 G     C  G    C/E G/D  D7 G
 The fellowship of kindred minds is like to  that above.

[V2]
 Before our Father's throne we pour our ardent prayers;
 Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one, our comforts and our cares.

[V3]
 We share our mutual woes, our mutual burdens bear,
 And often for each other flows the sympathising tear.

[V4]
 When for a while we part, this thought will soothe our pain,
 That we shall still be joined in heart, and hope to meet again.

[V5]
 This glorious hope revives our courage by the way,
 While each in expectation lives, and longs to see the day.

[V6]
 From sorrow, toil and pain, and sin we shall be free;
 And perfect love and friendship reign through all eternity. </lyrics>

.Em   C    G    B7/F#

[V1] 
.                               Em  C 
 I heard the bells on Christmas day
.                          G    D/F#
 Their old familiar carols play
.                                 Em  C
 And mild and sweet their songs repeat
.                               G  B7/F#
 Of peace on earth good will to men

[C1]
.                           C        G
 And the bells are ringing (Peace on earth)
.                              C        G
 Like a choir they're singing (Peace on earth)
.                        C                 Em                 D
 In my heart I hear them (Peace) Peace on earth, good will to men
 
[V2]
 And in despair I bowed my head
 There is no peace on earth I said
 For hate is strong and mocks the song
 Of peace on earth, good will to men

[C2]
 But the bells are ringing (Peace on earth)
 Like a choir singing (Peace on earth)
 Does anybody hear them? (Peace) Peace on earth, good will to men

[B]
.C
 Then rang the bells more loud and deep
.C                            Em
 God is not dead, nor does He sleep
.          D
 (Peace on earth, peace on earth)
.C
 The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
.              G                   D
 With peace on earth, good will to men

[V3]
 Then ringing singing on its way
 The world revolved from night to day
 A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
 Of peace on earth, good will to men

[C3]
 And the bells they're ringing (Peace on earth)
 Like a choir they're singing (Peace on earth)
 And with our hearts we'll hear them (Peace) Peace on earth, good will to men

[C4]
 Do you hear the bells they're ringing? (Peace on earth)
 The life the angels singing (Peace on earth)
 Open up your heart and hear them (Peace) Peace on earth, good will to men

[T]
.C        G      C         G
 Peace on earth, Peace on earth
.C        Em                  D
 Peace on earth, Good will to men

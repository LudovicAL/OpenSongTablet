.G C    D           G
 Jesus, lover of my soul,
.C             G/B             Dsus4 D
 All consuming fire is in Your gaze.
.G  C   D             G
 Jesus, I want You to know
.C             G/B        Dsus4 D
 I will follow You all my days.
 
[B]
.    G/B            C          Em   C
 For no one else in history is like You,
.    G/B     D                 C
 And history itself belongs to You.
.G          C              Em    C
 Alpha and Omega, You have loved me,
.    G/B           C            Dsus4 D
 And I will share eternity with You.
 
[C]
.               Em  C G/B    A
 It's all about You,  Jesus,
.                    Em  C
 And all this is for You,
.         G              D
 For Your glory and Your fame.
.               Em C
 It's not about me,
.      G                    C
 As if You should do things my way;
.G             D
 You alone are God,
.         C              G
 And I surrender to Your ways</lyrics>

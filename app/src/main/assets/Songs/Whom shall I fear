  <lyrics>[Intro]
.A   A/E x2

[V1]
.A
 You hear me when I call, You are my morning song
.D
 Though darkness fills the night it cannot hide the light
.F#m           D
 Whom shall I fear

[V2]
 You crush the enemy underneath my feet
 You are my sword and shield, though troubles linger still
 Whom shall I fear

[C]
.F#m         E/G#  A          A          E/G#      A
 I know who goes before me, I know who stands behind
.F#m         D            D         E     A
 The god of angel armies is always by my side
.F#m          E/G#       A     A       E/G#       A
 The one who reigns forever, He is a friend of mine
.F#m         D            D         E     A
 The god of angel armies is always by my side

[V3]
 My strength is in Your name, for You alone can save
 You will deliver me, Yours is the victory
.F#m           D     F#m           E
 Whom shall I fear, whom shall I fear

;Chorus

[B]
.    D               A               E
 And nothing formed against me shall stand
.A                                D
 You hold the whole world in Your hand
.    D       A          F#m   E
 I'm holding on to Your promises
.        D                 E
 You are faithful, you are faithful x2

.F#m      E
 You are faithful..

;Chorus

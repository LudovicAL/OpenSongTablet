  <lyrics>[V1]
.   F                     Am        G
 I open my mouth and You speak for me
.                F                Am       G
 You move the mountains and roll back the sea

[P]
.F          Am
 I will not be afraid
.G
 I will never be ashamed
.F                Am
 For You are with me
.G
 You are with me

[C]
.F              Am        G
 I've seen enough to know
.        Am            F
 That You're my only hope
.          Am       G
 I don't want to go
.      Am
 If You're not with me

[V2]
.     F                      Am        G
 We open our hands and You reach for us
.            F             Am      G
 You are the motion of the universe</lyrics>

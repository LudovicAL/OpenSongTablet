.A2
 Jesus I could sing in the tongues of men and angels
.                                                       E
 But if I have not love I am just a clanging cymbal, an empty sound||

.          A    B               E/G#
 This is a love song, this is a love song
.        A    B       E
 Jesus a love song to You
.          A    B                E/G#
 A song of devotion, of reverent passion
.          A    B       E
 Saviour a love song to You
 
 
[V2]
 Jesus I could pray with a faith that moves a mountain
 But if I have not love it is just a noise resounding, an empty sound||

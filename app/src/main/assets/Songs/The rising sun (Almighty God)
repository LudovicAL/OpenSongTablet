  <lyrics>[V1]
.A
 The rising Sun that fills the sky
.F#m                                  Esus E
 The starry host that lights the night
.                D
 Reflecting Your glory
.A
 The mountain heights, forever stand
.F#m                                 Esus E
 The rain that falls to soak the land
.                D
 Respond to Your glory
 
[C]
.         A             E
 Almighty God, in every way
.        Bm7         A         E
 You are above and beyond understanding
.              A                           E
 If we did not praise, the rocks would cry out
.         Bm7         A        E
 Glorious God, high above understanding
 
[V2]
 The vast expanse of earth and sea
 Held by You in harmony
 Speaks of Your glory
 All You've made, since time began
 Life itself; Your perfect plan
 And it's all for Your glory
 
[B]
.F#m  E/G# A       D       Bm7
 Creation  joins as one to sing
.       D         E
 What a Glorious God.
.F#m E/G#  A        D       Bm7 E
 So  far  above all earthly things</lyrics></song>

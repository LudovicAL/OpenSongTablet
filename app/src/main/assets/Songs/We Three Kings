  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em                B7     Em
 We three kings of Orient are;
.Em               B7     Em
 Bearing gifts we travel afar,
.Em        D         G       
 Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
.Am        B7     Em       
 Following yonder star.

[C]
.D D7 G               C       G
 O __ star of wonder, star of night,
.Em              G
 Star with royal beauty bright,
.Em       D        C        D7
 Westward leading, still proceeding,
.G               Em      G
 Guide us to the perfect light.

[V2]
 Born a King on Bethlehem plain,
 Gold I bring to crown Him again - 
 King forever, ceasing never,
 Over us all to reign:

[V3]
 Frankincense for Jesus have I,
 God on earth yet Priest on high;
 Prayer and praising all men raising
 Worship is earth's reply.

[V4]
 Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
 Tells of His death and Calvary's gloom;
 Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
 Sealed in a stone-cold tomb:

[V5]
 Glorious now, behold Him arise,
 King and God, and sacrifice;
 Heaven sings out 'Alleluia',
 'Amen' the earth replies:</lyrics>

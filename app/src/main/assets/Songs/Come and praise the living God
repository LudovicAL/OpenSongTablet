.Bm
 Come and Praise the Living God
.         F#                Bm
 Come and worship, come and worship
.Bm
 He has made you priest and king
.         F#                 Bm
 Come and worship the living God
 
[V1]
.Bm
 We come not to a mountain of fire and smoke
.Em               A           D
 Not to gloom and darkness or trumpet sound
.   Bm
 We come to the new Jerusalem
.    Em           F#
 The holy city of God
 
[V2]
 By His voice He shakes the earth
 His judgements known throughout the world
 But we have a city that for ever stands
 The holy city of God</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em                    C
 Iâ€™m not backing down, I will stand my ground
.G                D
 Lifting high the name of Jesus
.Em                      C
 Holding out Your light, To a world in need
.G              D
 Living out the love of Jesus
 
[P]
.Am7            G/B     C
 And though the battles rage
.Am7           G/B        C
 Your blessing still will come
 
[C]
.G                                           D
 To the ends of the earth we will go, To the ends of the earth we will go
.              Am7                C
 Fill us with power, Fill us with power
.G                                                 D
 For the truth of Your Word we will stand, For the truth of Your Word we will stand
.             Am7                   C
 Give us Your courage, Give us Your courage
 
[V2]
 Be our strength and song
 Till the battles won
 Cause Your face to shine upon us
 Stretch Your hand to save
 Our God never fails
 Nothing is impossible for You
 
[B]
.          D          C
 Would You breathe on us
.          G/B        Am7
 Would You breathe on us
.          D          C
 Would You breathe on us
.          G/B        Am7 G/B C
 Would You breathe on us</lyrics>

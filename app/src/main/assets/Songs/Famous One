.E           E/G#      A
 You are the Lord, the famous One, famous One,
.C#m7          B               A
 Great is Your name in all the earth;
.    E         E/G#          A
 The heavens declare|You are glorious, glorious,
.C#m7          B               (E to repeat) E G#maug5 D A
 Great is Your fame beyond the earth.
 
[V1]
.        F#m7                E/G#
 And for all You've done and yet to do,
.     A                E
 With every breath I'm praising You;
.  F#m7                E/G#
 Desire of nations and every heart,
.     A                  B
 You alone are God, You alone are God.
 
[V2]
.    F#m7            E/G#
 The morning star is shining through,
.    A            E
 And every eye is watching You;
.  F#m7                 E/G#
 Revealed by nature and miracles,
.        A                  B
 You are beautiful, You are beautiful.</lyrics>

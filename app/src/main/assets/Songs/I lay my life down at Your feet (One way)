.A                                F#m7
 I lay my life down at Your feet, You're the only one I need
.E                                D
 I turn to You and You are always there.
.A                                 F#m7
 In troubled times it's You I seek, I put You first, that's all I need
.E                         D
 I humble all I am, all to You
 
[C]
.A        E      
 One way, Jesus, 
.F#m7                     D
 You're the only one that I could live for
.A        E      
 One way, Jesus, 
.F#m7                     G                F#m7  D  F#m7  D
 You're the only one that I could live for
 
[V2]
 You are always there, everyhow and everywhere
 Your grace abounds so deeply within me
 You will never, never change, yesterday, today the same
 Forever 'till forever meets no end
 
[B]
.A                    E
 You are the way, the truth and the life
.F#m7                 D
 We live by faith and not by sight
.    F#m7       E              D
 For You, we're living all for You</lyrics>

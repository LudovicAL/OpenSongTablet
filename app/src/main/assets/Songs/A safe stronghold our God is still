  <lyrics>[V1]
.C            G        Am  D7 G
 A safe stronghold our God is still,
.Am F      C          Dm G7 C
 A  trusty shield and weapon;
.              G          Am  D7  G
 He'll help us clear from all the ill
.Am   F       C       Dm G7 C
 That hath us now o'ertaken.
.                   D  G
 The ancient prince of hell
.C               F  G7   C
 Hath risen with purpose fell;
.Em     Am            D   G
 Strong mail of craft and power
.Dm F  C    A7 Dm   A
 He weareth in this hour;
.Am Em       C       Dm G7 C
 On earth is not his fellow.

[V2]
 With force of arms we nothing can,
 Full soon were we down-ridden;
 But for us fights the proper Man,
 Whom God Himself hath bidden.
 Ask ye, Who is this same?
 Christ Jesus is His Name,
 The Lord Sabaoth's Son;
 He, and no other one,
 Shall conquer in the battle.

[V3]
 And were this world all devils o'er,
 And watching to devour us,
 We lay it not to heart so sore;
 Not they can overpower us.
 And let the prince of ill
 Look grim as e'er he will,
 He harms us not a whit;
 For why? - his doom is writ;
 A word shall quickly slay him.

[V4]
 Godâ€™s Word, for all their craft and force,
 One moment will not linger,
 But, spite of hell, shall have its course;
 'Tis written by His finger.
 And though they take our life,
 Goods, honor, children, wife,
 Yet is their profit small;
 These things shall vanish all:
 The City of God remaineth!</lyrics>

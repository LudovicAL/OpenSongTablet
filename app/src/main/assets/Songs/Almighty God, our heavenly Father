[V1]

 Almighty God, our heavenly Father,

 We have sinned against You,

 And against our fellow men,
.   Dm
 In thought and word and deed,
.        Bbmaj7 Am7          Dm
 Through negligence, through weakness,
.            Bb    Am7      Dsus4
 Through our own deliberate fault.
.       Am    Gm
 We are truly sorry
.      Bb      Bb/C C   F
 And repent of all  our sins.

.        Dm           Am7       Dsus4
 For the sake of Your Son Jesus Christ,
.    Gm          Bb/C  C  Bb/C
 Who died for us,
.C   C/F      F   C/Bb  Bb  C/Bb
 Who died for us,
.Bb  Gm7 Am     Dsus4
 Who died   for us,
.   Dm    
 Forgive us all that is past;
.    Bbmaj7     Am7    Dm
 And grant that we may serve You
.   Bb Am7     D
 In newness of life.

[V3]

.       Em7   G/A D/A    Bm

 To the glory of  Your name, (Men)

 To the glory of  Your name, (Women)

 To the glory of Your name. (All)

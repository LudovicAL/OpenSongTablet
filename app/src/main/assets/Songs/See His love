.Am                  G
 See His love nailed on to a cross
.              F                      G
 Perfect and blameless life given as sacrifice
.Am                       G
 See Him there all in the name of love
.             F                    G
 Broken yet glorious, all for the sake of us
 
[C]
.Am             F
 This is Jesus in his glory
.G               E     E7
 King of heaven dying for me
.Am               F
 It is finished, He has done it
.G          E      E7           Am
 Death is beaten, heaven beckons me
 
[V2]
.Am                    G
 Greater love no one could ever show
.              F                      G
 Mercy so undeserved, freedom i should not know
.Am                       G
 All my sin, all of my hidden shame
.             F                    G
 Died with Him on the cross, eternity won for us
 
[B]
.Am          G/B
 Such love, such love
.Em                     F 
 Such love is this for me</lyrics></song>

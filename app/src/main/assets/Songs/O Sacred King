  <lyrics>[V1]
.G         C    G      C
 O sacred King, O holy King
.Am         G            D
 How can I honor You rightly
.Am           G             D
 Honor that's fit for Your name
 
[V2] 
 O sacred friend, O holy friend
 I don't take what You did lightly
 Friendship instead of disgrace
 
[C]
.             G                      
 For it's the mystery of the universe, 
.Am
 You're the God of holiness
.G/B                        C
 Yet You welcome souls like me
.            G                                
 And with the blessing of Your Father's heart, 
.    Am
 You discipline the ones You love
.        G/B                   C
 There's kindness in Your majesty
.      Am             G         D
 Jesus those who recognise Your power
.     Am             G       D
 Know just how wonderful You are
.               G
 When You draw near.

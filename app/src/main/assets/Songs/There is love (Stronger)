  <title>There is love (Stronger)</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.F             G            C
 There is Love that came for us
.F        G         C
 Humbled to a sinner's cross
.F              G     Am
 You broke my shame and sinfulness
.F         G      F
 You rose again victorious

[V2]
.C           F          G       C
 Faithfulness none can deny
.F              G             C
 Through the storm and through the fire
.F          G        Am
 There is truth that sets me free
.F            G          C
 Jesus Christ who lives in me

[C]
.       C                 G
 You are stronger, You are stronger
.Am             F
 Sin is broken, You have saved me
.C              G
 It is written, Christ is risen
.F            G         F
 Jesus You are Lord of all

[V3]
.C        F         G        C
 No beginning and no end
.F            G        C
 You're my hope and my defence
.F            G           Am
 You came to seek and save the lost
.F     G           C
 You paid it all upon the cross

[B]
.                    F
 So let Your Name be lifted higher
.Am            G     C
 Be lifted higher
.G
 Be lifted higher</lyrics>

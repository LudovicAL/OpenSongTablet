  <lyrics>[V1]
.F#m                            Bm7
 Bigger than the air I breathe, deeper than the ocean deep
.Dmaj7                          Bm7
 Higher than the stars above You are.
 
.F#m                            Bm7
 Brighter than the blazing sun, louder than the screaming crowd
.Dmaj7                               Bm7
 Stronger than the power of death You are.
 
[C]
.A                     E/G#                  D
 In the heavens on the earth there is no-one like You God
.         A/C#           E/G#                  A
 And these words are not enough to tell of who You are
.                       E/G#                           Dmaj7
 Who can know the mind of God? Who can understand Your ways?
.                       Esus                          F#m B/D#
 And these words are not enough to tell of Your great name.
 
[V2]
 Your love can melt the hardest heart, 
 Your words can bring the dead to life
 Nothing is impossible for You
 Awesome God, Humble King
 You terrify yet welcome in
 Your glory echoes all around the world
 
[B]
.F#m  C#/F                     F#m  C#/F
 You, You, You, There's always You, You, You
.      Dmaj7       C#/F        Eb/G
 Unbreakable, unshakable, unbeatable
.F#m  C#/F                     F#m  C#/F
 You, You, You, There's always You, You, You
.         Dmaj7             C#/F            Eb/G  F#sus
 Take the world but give me You, Lord Jesus You

 All I want is You</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.    E     E/G#  A              B/D#         E     B/D#
 For every disappointment, for every broken heart,
.    C#m         A           B/D#
 For everyone in darkness; a light
.    E     E/G#    A           B/D#        E   B/D#
 For every wounded person, for every tired mind,
.    C#m          A         B/D#
 For hopeless situations; a hope

[C]
.    E     E/G#  A           B           E      B/D#
 The cross still stands, the cross still towers,
.    C#m         A          B            E
 His blood still cleanses, eternally the same.

[V2]
.    E        E/G#  A              B/D#            E  B/D#
 For everyone who's desperate, for every one who's lost
.    C#m            A          B/D#
 For everyone who's fearful; a shelter
.    E     E/G#    A             B/D#          E    B/D#
 For every painful question, for every one's regrets
.    C#m           A             B/D#
 For every cry of 'Why God?'; an answer.

[C]
.    E     E/G#  A           B           E       B/D#
 The cross still stands, the cross still towers,
.    C#m         A          B            E
 His blood still cleanses, eternally the same.


[B]
.C#m       A      F#m       B/D#
 Grace and peace, mercy and joy
.C#m     A       F#m   B/D#
 All undeserved, I bow down

[C]
.    E     E/G#  A           B/D#        E
 The cross still stands, the cross still towers,
.    C#m         A          B/D#         E
 His blood still cleanses, eternally the same.


[C2]
.E E/G# A            B/D#       E          B/D#
 I bow  down, Lord I run to the cross again
.C#m   A     B/D#  E    
 I bow down, I bow down.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.      A    A7       D           A                      
 There is a fountain filled with blood 
.                      E  
 Drawn from Emmanuel's veins 
.    A       A7        D          A 
 And sinners plunged beneath that flood
.     Bm        E      A   D  A  E
 Lose all their guilty stains

[C]
.     A         A7     D 
 Lose all their guilty stains, 
.     A                E 
 Lose all their guilty stains
.    A       A7        D          A
 And sinners plunged beneath that flood 
.     Bm        E      A   D  A  E 
 Lose all their guilty stains

[V2]
 The dying thief rejoiced to see 
 That fountain in his day
 And there may I, as vile as he
 Wash all my sins away

[V3]
 Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
 Shall never lose it's power
 Till all the ransomed church of God
 Be saved to sin no more

[V4]
 E'er since by faith I saw the stream 
 Thy flowing wounds supply
 Redeeming love has been my theme
 And shall be till I die</lyrics>

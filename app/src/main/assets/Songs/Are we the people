  <lyrics>[C]
.G          D/F#            Em                C
 Are we the people who will see God's kingdom come,
.G          D/F#           C
 When He is known in every nation ?
.G            D/F#            Em            C
 One thing is certain, we are closer than before;
.G           D/F#          C
 Keep moving on,  last generation.

[V1]
.Em    D/F#             C
 These are the days for harvest,
.Em D/F#          Cmaj7
 To gather in the lost.
.Em  D/F#              C
 Let those who live in darkness
.Em       D/F#           C
 Hear the message of the cross.

[V2]
 We'll go where God is sending,
 We'll do what He commands.
 These years that He has waited
 Could be coming to an end.</lyrics>

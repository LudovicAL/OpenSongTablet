2Your sweetest songs em__ploy;
3And makes the nations   prove
.      D
1Let   every heart prepare Him room,
2While field and streams, and hills, and plains.
3The   glories of His righteousness,
.    D
1And heav'n and nature sing,
2Re__peat the sounding joy,
3The wonders of His love,
.    A
1And heav'n and nature sing,
2Re__peat the sounding joy,
3The wonders of His love,
.    D                     G   A    D
1And heav'n and heav'n and na__ture sing!
2Re__peat, repeat the      sounding joy.
3The wonders, wonders      of  His  love.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
 Lord you are good
 For your mercy endureth forever.
 (repeat)
 
[P]
 People from every nation and tongue,
 From generation to generation
 
[C]
 We worship You, hallelujah, hallelujah
 We worship You, for who You are
 (repeat)
 You are good
 
[T]
 You are good, all the time
 All the time, You are good

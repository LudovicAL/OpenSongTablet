  <lyrics>[V1]
.Eb              Ab      Bb7 Eb
 Brother, let me be your servant,
.Cm           Fm        Bb
 Let me be as Christ to you;
.Ab        Eb    Ab       Fm
 Pray that I may have the grace
.Eb Fm            Ab Bb7   Eb
 To let you be my servant, too.
 
[V2]
 We are pilgrims on a journey,
 We are brothers on the road;
 We are here to help each other
 Walk the mile and bear the load.
 
[V3]
 I will hold the Christlight for you
 In the night-time of your fear;
 I will hold my hand out to you,
 Speak the peace you long to hear.
 
[V4]
 I will weep when you are weeping,
 When you laugh I'll laugh with you;
 I will share your joy and sorrow
 Till we've seen this journey through.
 
[V5]
 When we sing to God in heaven
 We shall find such harmony,
 Born of all we've known together
 Of Christ's love and agony.
 
[V6]
 Brother, let me be your servant,
 Let me be as Christ to you;
 Pray that I may have the grace
 To let you be my servant, too.

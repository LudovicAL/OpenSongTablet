  <lyrics>[V1]
.   Gm                    F         Gm
 In Heavenly armour we'll enter the land
.    Eb        F            Gm
 The battle belongs to the Lord
.   Gm                       F              Gm
 No weapon that's fashioned against us will stand
.    Eb        F            Gm
 The battle belongs to the Lord

[C]
.    Eb  F    Bb  F   Eb F Bb 
 And we sing Glory, Honour
.Eb         F               Gm
 Power and strength to the Lord      x2

[V2]
 When the powers of darkness come in like a flood
 The battle belongs to the Lord
 He's raised up a standard the power of His blood
 The battle belongs to the Lord

[V3]
 When the enemy presses in hard do not fear
 The battle belongs to the Lord
 Take courage my friend your redemption is near
 The battle belongs to the Lord

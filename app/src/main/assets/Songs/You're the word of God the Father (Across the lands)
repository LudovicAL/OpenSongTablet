  <lyrics>[V1]
.           D               G              D                A
 You're the word of God the Father, from before the world began
.      G        G6    D/F#             Em                G
 Every star and every planet, has been fashioned by Your hand
.       D             G              D             A
 All creation holds together, by the power of Your voice
.        G       G6         D/F#           Em       G    Asus
 Let the skies declare Your glory, let the land and seas rejoice
 
[C]
.           G            D  D/F#           G       A     Bm  Bm7/A 
 You're the author of creation, You're the Lord of every man
.         G      G/A        Bm7  A         D
 And Your cry of love rings out across the lands
 
[V2]
 Yet You left the gaze of angels, came to seek and save the lost
 And exchanged the joy of heaven, for the anguish of a cross
 With a prayer You fed the hungry, with a word You stilled the sea
 Yet how silently You suffered, that the guilty may go free
 
[V3]
 With a shout You rose victorious, wrestling victory from the grave
 And ascended into heaven, leading captives in Your wake
 Now You stand before the Father, interceding for Your own
 From each tribe and tongue and nation, You are leading sinners home

;Chorus 3x at end, acapella last time.

  <lyrics>[V1]
.           D               G              D                A
 You're the word of God the Father, from before the world began
.      G        G6    D/F#             Em                G
 Every star and every planet, has been fashioned by Your hand
.       D             G              D             A
 All creation holds together, by the power of Your voice
.        G       G6         D/F#           Em       G    Asus
 Let the skies declare Your glory, let the land and seas rejoice
 
[C]
.           G            D  D/F#           G       A     Bm  Bm7/A 
 You're the author of creation, You're the Lord of every man
.         G      G/A        Bm7  A         D
 And Your cry of love rings out across the lands
 
[V2]
.        D                G               D                 A
 Yet You left the gaze of angels, came to seek and save the lost
.      G           G6     D/F#            Em           G
 And exchanged the joy of heaven, for the anguish of a cross
.       D                  G              D                    A
 With a prayer You fed the hungry, with a word You stilled the sea
.        G     G6     D/F#               Em     G      Asus
 Yet how silently You suffered, that the guilty may go free
 
[V3]
.       D                 G                  D                A
 With a shout You rose victorious, wrestling victory from the grave
.     G       G6   D/F#            Em               G
 And ascended into heaven, leading captives in Your wake
.        D                G            D               A
 Now You stand before the Father, interceding for Your own
.          G         G6         D/F#            Em      G       Asus
 From each tribe and tongue and nation, You are leading sinners home

;Chorus 3x at end, acapella last time.

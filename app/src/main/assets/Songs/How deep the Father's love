.D      Em D/F# G2       D/A       A  D   (as last two lines)

[V1]
.    D                 Em   D/F# G2      D/F#            Bm7 A
 How deep the Father's love for  us, how vast beyond all measure,
.     D                  Em D/F# G2      D/A               A   D
 That He should give his on___ly Son, to make a wretch His treasure.
.    D/F#              G/B D/A G2         D/F#             Bm7  A
 How great the pain of sear_ing loss, the Father turns His face away,
.   D                    Em D/F# G2          D/A          A  D
 As wounds which mar the chos__en One, bring many sons to glory.

[V2]
.  D             Em  D/F# G2        D/F#         Bm7  A
 Behold the man upon a    cross, my sin upon His shoulders;
. D                 Em D/F# G2         D/A           A   D
 Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice call out among the scoffers.
.   D/F#            G/B  D/A G2      D/F#        Bm7 A
 It was my sin that held Him there until it was accomplished;
.    D                Em      D/F# G2       D/A             A D
 His dying breath has brought me   life - I know that it is finished.

[V3]
.  D                 Em D/F# G2    D/F#              Bm7 A
 I will not boast in anything,  no gifts no power no wisdom;
.    D               Em D/F# G2          D/A           A   D
 But I will boast in Jesus   Christ, His death and resurrection.
.    D/F#               G/B D/A G2     D/F#           Bm7 A
 Why should I gain from His reward?  I cannot give an answer,
.    D                Em  D/F# G2         D/A                 A  D
 But this I know with all my   heart, His wounds have paid my ransom.

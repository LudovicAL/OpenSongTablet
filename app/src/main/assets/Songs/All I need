[C1]
.D          G9/D        D/F#               G  D/A  Em7/B A/C# D
 ____ All I need, all I seek,|Your light a pathway to    my   feet
.          G9/B              D/F#            G    D/F# Em7 A     G   Asus4
 You're my strength when I'm weak,|Giving me hope where I  can't see,
.       A     D    A7sus4
 You're all I need.

[V1]
.D9                    Em7
 When my hope is gone,|No strength to carry on,
.D/F#                          G/A               Asus4 A
 Lord, You will carry me,|Your feet are all I'll see,
.D9                        Em7
 Through the thirsty land,|Onto a higher ground,
.D/F#                                  G                 Asus4 A
 There Lord, You'll set me down,|Where I will stand with You,
.      Em7   Asus4 A    D
 I can stand because of You.

[V2]
 When I turn away,|Another path to stray,
 Lord You wait for me,|With arms outstretched I see.
 I could never be|Far from Your care for me,
 Your love envelopes me,|Now I can stand in You,
 I can stand because of You.

[C2]

  <lyrics>[V1]
.A  E        A     D   E7 A
 As with gladness, men of old
.D       A  D    A    E A
 Did the guiding star behold
.A  E        A    D      E7  A
 As with joy they hailed its light
.D       A D     A  E    A
 Leading onward, beaming bright
.A   E7   F#m      E        A
 So, most gracious God, may we
.D   A    D  A   E7 A
 Evermore be led by Thee.

[V2]
 As with joyful steps they sped
 Saviour, to Thy lowly bed
 There to bend the knee before
 Thee Whom heaven and earth adore;
 So may we with willing feet
 Ever seek Thy mercy seat.

[V3]
 As they offered gifts most rare
 At that cradle rude and bare;
 So may we with holy joy,
 Pure and free from sin's alloy,
 All our costliest treasures bring,
 Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.

[V4]
 Holy Jesus, every day
 Keep us in the narrow way;
 And, when earthly things are past,
 Bring our ransomed souls at last
 Where they need no sou to guide,
 Where no clouds Thy glory hide.

[V5]
 In the heavenly country bright,
 Need they no created light;
 Thou its light, its joy, its crown,
 Thou its sun which goes not down;
 There forever may we sing
 Hallelujahs to our King!   </lyrics>

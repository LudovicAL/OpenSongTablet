  <lyrics>[V1]
 The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want.
 He makes me down to lie
 In pastures green He leadeth me, 
 The quiet waters by

[V2]
 My soul He doth restore again
 And me to walk doth make
 Within the paths of righteousness, 
 Even for His own name's sake

[V3]
 Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale, 
 Yet will I fear none ill:
 For Thou art with me and Thy rod 
 And staff me comfort still

[V4]
 My table Thou hast furnished 
 In presence of my foes;
 My head Thou dost with oil annoint,
 And my cup overflows

[V5]
 Goodness and mercy all my life
 Shall surely follow me:
 And in God's house for evermore 
 My dwelling place shall be</lyrics>

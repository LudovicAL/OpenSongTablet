. E    A

[V1]
.      E           A
 On my knees I bow down
.E                             A
 Sing about the healer|And the hope I've found||
.            C#m7              B
 You took my tears|You took my shame
.            A
 Washed them all away

[V2]
.            E                     A
 Love shines down on this heart of mine
.E                        A
 Lead me to the waters|Of eternal life||
.           C#m7             B
 I once was lost|But now I'm found
.       A
 It's a brand new day

[C]
.     F#m7      E     B
 Your love, it amazes me
.     F#m7     E      B
 Your love has lifted me||
.A/C#        B/D#    E        A
 Higher than I|Could possibly dream
.F#m7      B               E    A     (E  A)
 Your love amazes me

[T]
.       E     A                     E    A
 Hallelujah!  |  Your love amazes me

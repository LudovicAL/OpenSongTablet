.      F#m7
 As we come today,
.     E/G#              A
 We remind ourselves of what we do;
.           F#m7               E/G#
 That these songs are not just songs,
.             D2
 But signs of love for You.
.          F#m7 E/G#   A
 This is a holy moment now,
.             F#m7   E/G#    A
 Something of heaven touches earth,
.          F#m7   E/G#  A
 Voices of angels all resound,
.              Bsus 
 We join their song.

.F#m7        E/G#
 Come, come, come,
.       A       Bsus 
 Let us worship God
.         F#m7       E/G#
 With our hands held high,
.        D2
 And our hearts bowed down.
.        F#m7      E/G#
 We will run, run, run,
.             A        Bsus 
 Through Your gates, O God,
.       F#m7           E/G#
 With a shout of love, 
.       D2
 With a shout of love.

.           F#m7
 Lord, with confidence
.   E/G#             A
 We come before Your throne of grace.
.         F#m7          E/G#
 Not that we deserve to come
.             D2*
 But You have paid the way.
.            F#m7 E/G#    A
 You are the holy King of all,
.           F#m7      E/G#    A
 Heaven and earth are in Your hands,
.           F#m7   E/G#      A
 All of the angels sing Your song,
.             Bsus 
 We join them now.

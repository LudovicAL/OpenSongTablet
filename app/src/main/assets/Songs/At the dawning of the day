 At the dawning of the day,|As Your glory fills the sky,
.     F                      C2
 With creation, we sing Your praise.
.    C2                            G/B
 The bird song and the breeze,|The rivers and the trees,
.       F                    C2
 All creation, it sings Your praise.

[P]

 And we lift our song to the King

 With the angels round Your throne

 Raise a cry of praise to You:

 You are holy,|You are worthy,

 You are faithful,|And You're my King.||
.         C2                    C2/E
 Robed in splendour,|Crowned in glory,
.         F   G..            C2  (as intro)
 High and mighty,|You are my King

 Revealed in all we see,|Lights in the sky You know by name,
 With creation, we sing Your praise.||
 Every creature on the earth,|Every flower turned to You,
 All creation, it sings Your praise.

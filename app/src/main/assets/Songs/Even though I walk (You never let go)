  <lyrics>[V1]
.              A2
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
.     D2/F#
 Your perfect love is casting out fear.
.                  A2
 And even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life,
.  D2/F#
 I won't turn back, I know You are near.
 
[P]
.                  F#m7 E A2              F#m7 E A2
 And I will fear no ev___il, for my God is wit_h me.
.                F#m7 E A2
 And if my God is wit_h me,
.                  E                        D2
 Whom then shall I fear? Whom then shall I fear?
 
[C]
.A2
 Oh no, You never let go, through the calm and through the storm
.F#m7
 Oh no, You never let go, In every high and every low
.Esus                    D2                           A2 Esus D2
 O no, You never let go, Lord, You never let go of me.
 
[V2]
 And I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on
 A glorious light beyond all compare.
 And there will be an end to these troubles, But until that day comes,
 We'll live to know You here on the earth.
 
[B]
.                 A2
 Yes, I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on,
.                     F#m7
 And there will be an end to these troubles, but until that day comes,
.Esus                     D2                      A2 Esus D2
 Still I will praise You, still I will praise You.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.Am      Am/G     Am/Gb   Fm6
 Loved before the dawn of time,
.C/E          Fmaj7  C/G          F/A
 Chosen by my Maker, hidden in my Saviour,
.Am   Am/G     Am/Gb   Fm6
 I am His  and He   is mine,
.C/E            F Gsus4 G C
 Cherished for eternity.

[V2]
 When I'm stained with guilt and sin,
 He is there to lift me, heal me and forgive me;
 Gives me strength to stand again,
 Stronger than I was before.

[C]
.        G G/F C/E             Fmaj7
 So with every   breath that I am given
.       C/G             G7sus4  G7
 I will sing salvation's song;
.          G  G/F C/E      Fmaj7
 And I'll join the  chorus of creation
.       C/G             Gsus4  (E/B to verse or G to bridge)
 Giving praise to Christ alone.

[V3]
 All the claims of Satan's curse
 Lifted through His offering, satisfied through suffering;
 All the blessings He deserves
 Poured on my unworthy soul.

[B]
.        C/E    Fmaj7   C/G     F/A
 Singing glory, honour, wisdom, power
.C/G         C7       Fmaj7
 To the Lamb upon the throne;
.Dm7  C/E    Fmaj7  D/F#     G  G/F
 Hallelujah, I will lift Him high.

;repeat bridge

.Dm7  C/E   Fmaj7  D/F#      G     G/F
 Hallelujah I will sing with every breath...)

[V4]
 Stars will fade and mountains fall;
 Christ will shine forever, love's unfading splendour.
 Earth and heaven will bow in awe,
 Joining in salvation's song.</lyrics>

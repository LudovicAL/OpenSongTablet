.C   G7       C                   Dm
 All over the world the Spirit is moving,
.    G7       Dm           G                     C
 All over the world as the prophet said it would be;
.C   G7       C                      E   F
 All over the world there's a mighty revelation
.       F#dim7       C Gm A7        Dsus4  Dm    G7  C
 Of the glory of the Lord,   as the waters cover the sea.

[V2]
 All over His church God's Spirit is moving,
 All over His church as the prophet said it would be;
 All over His church there's a mighty revelation
 Of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.

[V3]
 Right here in this place the Spirit is moving,
 Right here in this place as the prophet said it would be;
 Right here in this place there's a mighty revelation
 Of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</lyrics>

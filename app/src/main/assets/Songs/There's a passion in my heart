  <lyrics>[V1]
.          A                      Amaj7
 There's a passion in my heart to know You more and more
.       D            A/E  E
 Not in part, not in part.
.          A                              Amaj7
 There's a burning in my heart, there's a fire in my soul,
.       D            A/E      E
 Let it burn, let it burn for You.

[C]    
.A              F#m
 Jesus, give me Jesus.
.    D    
 For all this world can give me,
.          A/E              E
 What with You Lord, can compare ?
.        A           F#m
 Give me Jesus, only Jesus,
.    D                 E          A
 For You have set this fire in my heart.

[V2]
 There's a yearning in this life, I will go where You may lead,
 I will go, I will go with You.
 There's a promise for this life, there's a promise far beyond,
 Thank You Lord, thank you Lord.

[V3]
 There's a hunger in my soul, one desire, to seek Your face,
 Guide me Lord, guide me Lord.
 There's a thirsting in my soul, in this dry and thirsty land,
 Let it pour, may Your Spirit pour</lyrics>

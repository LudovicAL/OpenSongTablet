 He was crucified|but now he's risen like he said, hallelujah!

 Clap your hands, clap your hands like this.|Clap your hands like this to celebrate
 Clap your hands, clap your hands like this.|Clap your hands like this to celebrate

 Dance to the beat, to the beat of the drum,|To the beat of the drum to celebrate
 Dance to the beat, to the beat of the drum,|To the beat of the drum to celebrate

 Wave your hands, wave your hands in the air,|Wave your hands in the air to celebrate
 Wave your hands, wave your hands in the air,|Wave your hands in the air to celebrate

[V5]
 Clap your hands, clap your hands like this.|Clap your hands like this to celebrate
 Clap your hands, clap your hands like this.|Clap your hands like this to celebrate

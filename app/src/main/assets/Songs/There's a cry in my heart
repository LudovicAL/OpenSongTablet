.D                         A
 There's a cry in my heart for your glory to fall 
.Em Asus A 
 For your presence to fill up my senses 
.D                         A
 There's a yearning again, a thirst for discipline 
.Em Asus A 
 A hunger for things that are deeper 

[B]
. Bm G                    D  A
 Could you take me beyond, could you carry me through 
.Bm G                  D   A
 If I opened my heart, could I go there with you 
.Bm G                       D   A
 For I've been here before, yet I know there's still more 
.Em A 
 O Lord, I need to know you 

[C]
.G                  D
 For what do I have if I don't have you Jesus 
.A                   Bm
 What in this life could mean anymore 
.G                D
 You are my rock, You are my glory 
.A G Bm 
 You are the lifter of my head</lyrics>

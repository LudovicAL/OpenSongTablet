1 Man of Sorrows,    what a   name! For the  Son of     God, Who came
2 Bearing shame and  scoffing rude, In my    place con__demned He stood;
3 Guilty, vile, and  helpless we;   Spotless Lamb of    God was He;
4 Lifted up was      He to    die;  "It is   finished!" was His cry;
5 When He comes, our glorious King, All His  ransomed   home to bring,

. A                D/A        A             E    F#m    D  A
1 Ruined sinners   to re______claim. Hallelujah! What a Savior!
2 Sealed my pardon with His   blood. Hallelujah! What a Savior!
3 Full atonement!  Can it     be? Hallelu___jah! What a Savior!
4 Now in heaven ex_alted      high. Hallelu_jah! What a Savior!
5 Then anew His    song weâ€™ll sing: Hallelu_jah! What a Savior!</lyrics>

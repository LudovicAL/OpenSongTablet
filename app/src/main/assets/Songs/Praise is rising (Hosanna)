.F                                     Bb2              F
 Praise is rising, eyes are turning to You, we turn to You
.                                          Bb2               F5
 Hope is stirring, hearts are yearning for You, we long for You
.                 C               Bb                  F
 'Cause when we see You, we find strength to face the day
.           C              Bb              F            Csus
 In Your Presence all our fears are washed away, washed away

 Hosanna, hosanna
.              F5             Csus         Dm7       Bb2
 You are the God Who saves us, worthy of all our praises

 Come have Your way among us

 We welcome You here, Lord Jesus
 
[V2]
 Hear the sound of hearts returning to You, we turn to You
 In Your kingdom, broken lives are made new, You make us new
 'Cause when we see You, we find strength to face the day
 In Your Presence all our fears are washed away, washed away

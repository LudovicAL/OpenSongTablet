.G                                     C2              G
 Praise is rising, eyes are turning to You, we turn to You
.                                          C2               G5
 Hope is stirring, hearts are yearning for You, we long for You
.                 D               C                  G
 'Cause when we see You, we find strength to face the day
.           D              C              G            Dsus
 In Your Presence all our fears are washed away, washed away
 
[C]
. Gsus G   Em7  C2
 Hosanna, hosanna
.              G5             Dsus         Em7       C2
 You are the God Who saves us, worthy of all our praises
. Gsus G   Em7  C2
 Hosanna, hosanna
.                 G5       Dsus
 Come have Your way among us
.                  Em7         C2
 We welcome You here, Lord Jesus
 
[V2]
 Hear the sound of hearts returning to You, we turn to You
 In Your kingdom, broken lives are made new, You make us new
 'Cause when we see You, we find strength to face the day
 In Your Presence all our fears are washed away, washed away

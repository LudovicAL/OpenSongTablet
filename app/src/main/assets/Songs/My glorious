.Em                                    C  Am
 The world's shaking with the power of God
.Em                                      C   Am
 Great and glorious, let the whole Earth sing.
 
[P]

 And all you ever do, Is change the old for new.
.Am
 People, we believe that,

.G             D/F#       Em
 God is bigger than the air I breath,
.                D
 The world we'll leave
.    G                 D/F#             Em
 And God will save the day, and all will say
.     D
 My Glorious

 Clouds are breaking, Heavens come to Earth.
 Hearts awakening, let the church bells ring</lyrics></song>

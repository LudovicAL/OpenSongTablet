.          C                      G
 Shout for joy and sing, let your praises ring
.         F                 G             C   G
 See that God is building a Kingdom for a King
.             C                         G
 His dwelling place with men, the new Jerusalem
.      F        G         C
 Where Jesus is Lord over all

[C]
.    G/B     Am F     G  C
 And we will worship, worship
.G/B     Am F              G
 We will worship Jesus the Lord

 And we will worship, worship
.G/B     Am F              G
 We will worship Jesus the Lord

[V2]
 A work so long concealed in time will be revealed
 As the sons of God shall rise and take their stand
 Clothed in His righteousness, the church made manifest
 Where Jesus is Lord over all

[V3]
 Sovereign over all, hail Him, risen Lord
 For He alone is worthy of our praise
 Reigning in majesty, ruling in victory
 Jesus is Lord over all</lyrics>

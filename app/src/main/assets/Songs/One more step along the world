  <lyrics>[Intro]
.Bm  C  D  D7  G  D7  G  C  G

[V1]
.G                       D            D7                      G
 One more step along the world I go,||One more step along the world I go,
.G                   C      G    G       D          G    C    G
 From the old things to the new,||Keep me traveling along with You:

[C]
.         Bm       C     D             D7
 And it's from the old I travel to the new,
.G       D7         G    C    G
 Keep me traveling along with You.

[V2]
.G                        D              D7                      G
 Round the corners of the world I turn,||More and more about the world I learn,
.G                  C      G     G         D           G    C    G
 All the new things that I see,||You'll be looking at along with me:

[V3]
.G                       D              D7                    G
 As I travel through the bad and good,||Keep me traveling the way I should;
.G             C      G    G         D              G    C G
 When I see no way to go,||You'll be telling me the way, I know:

[V4]
.G                        D                D7                        G
 Give me courage when the world is rough,||Keep me loving though the world is tough;
.G                C     G    G       D          G    C    G
 Leap and song in all I do,||Keep me traveling along with You:

[V5]
.G                      D              D7                        G
 You are older than the world can be,||You are stronger than the life in me;
.G            C    G     G       D          G    C    G
 Ever old and ever new,||Keep me traveling along with You:

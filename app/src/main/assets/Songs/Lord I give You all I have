.D               D/F#
 Lord I give You all I have,
.      G
 These words are not enough,
.     D            D/F#
 This heart I rend before You, 
.     G
 Come Lord, please have Your way.||
.          Bm9                   Bm/A           Gmaj7
 Make Your light to shine on the deepest places,
.          Bm9                   Bm/A           G   Asus4   A
 Make Your light to shine on the deepest places.
 
[C1]
.          D                Em
 I lift my hands, I lift my voice,
.       D/F#              G
 I fall before You at the cross
 (repeat)|
.       Em             D/F# G       
 And my heart cries out, my heart cries out, 
. Asus4       D    F#m  G   A
 “Forgive me, Lord”
 
[V2]
 You’ve changed my heart, renewed my mind,
 And You have heard my cry.
 You lift my head to see Your face, 
 Your beauty fills my eyes.||
 You make Your light to shine from the deepest places.
 You make Your light to shine from the deepest places.
 
[C2]
 I lift my hands, I lift my voice,
 I fall before You at the cross
 (repeat)|
 And my heart cries out, my heart cries out, 
 “You are my Lord”

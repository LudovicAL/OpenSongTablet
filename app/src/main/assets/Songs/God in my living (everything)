.B                             E
 God in my living, there in my breathing
.          G#m               F#
 God in my waking, God in my sleeping||
.B                             E
 God in my resting, there in my working
.          G#m                F#
 God in my thinking, God in my speaking
 
[C]
.           E    F#
 Be my everything
.           G#m  F#
 Be my everything
.           E    F#
 Be my everything
.           B
 Be my everything
 
[V2]
 God in my hoping, There in my dreaming
 God in my watching, God in my waiting||
 God in my laughing, There in my weeping
 God in my hurting, God in my healing
 
[B]

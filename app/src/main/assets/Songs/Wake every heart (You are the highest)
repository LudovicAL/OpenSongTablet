  <lyrics>[V1]
.     G/B   C         D     G
 Wake every heart and every tongue
.   G/B      C   D       G
 To sing the new eternal song
.    D         C       G/B   C
 And crown Him King of Glory now
.   D/F#     C       Em D/F#
 Confess Him Lord of all
 
[C]
.            G                     D/F#
 You are the highest, You are the greatest
.            Am7  G/B D
 You are the Lord of all
.            G                     D/F#
 Angels will worship, Nations will bow down
.       Am7  G  C
 To the Lord of all
 
[V2]
 A day will come when all will sing
 And glorify our matchless King
 Your name unrivaled stands alone
 You are the Lord of all

 Let every heart, Let every tongue|Sing, sing, sing
 
[B2]
.C                                     D
 Lifting you higher, higher and higher|Lifting you higher, higher and higher
.Em                                     C
 Lifting you higher, higher and higher, Lord</lyrics>

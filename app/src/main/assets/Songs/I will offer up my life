.Em7  D/F# G    x4   

[V1]
.D                  G       A7sus4 A   D 
 I will offer up my life in spirit and truth
.                       G          A7sus4  A  D
 Pouring out the oil of love as my worship to You
.      D/B           G       A7sus4 A Bm
 In surrender I must give my every    part
.       Bm7/A          G         A7sus4 A D
 Lord receive the sacrifice of a broken   heart

[C]
.D      D/F#       G     A7sus4   A D
 Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
.      D/F#       G             A7sus4 A D
 To so faithful a friend, to so loving a King
.        D/F#        G     A7sus4   A  D
 Saviour what can be said, what can be sung
.     D/F#           G            A7sus4     A    D
 As a praise of Your name for the things You have done||
.                     Em7       D/F#    G
 O my words could not tell, not even in part
.       Em7     D/F#         G
 Of the debt of love that is owed
.   A7sus4    A   D     Em7 D/F# G
 By this thankful heart.

[V2]
 You deserve my every breath for You've paid the great cost
 Giving up Your life to death, even death on a cross
 You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
 Opened up the gates of heaven and have beckoned me in.

[B]
.Em7              D/F#
 What can I give, what can I bring,
.G                              Em7  D/F#  G .....
 What can I sing as an offering Lord?</lyrics>

.    D                  A 
 The wise man built his house upon the rock
.    A7                 D 
 The wise man built his house upon the rock
.    D7                 G              Em
 The wise man built his house upon the rock
.        D         A        D  G  D  A
 And the rain came tumbling down

[C1]
.        D                      A
 And the rain came down and the floods came up
.    A7                     D
 The rain came down and the floods came up
.    D7                     G           Em
 The rain came down and the floods came up
.        D            A          D  G  D  A
 And the house on the rock stood firm

[V2]
 The foolish man built his house upon the sand
 The foolish man built his house upon the sand
 The foolish man built his house upon the sand
 And the rain came tumbling down

[C2] 
 And the rain came down and the floods came up
 The rain came down and the floods came up
 The rain came down and the floods came up
 And the house on the sand fell flat</lyrics>

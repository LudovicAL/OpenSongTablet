.E/G#       A      B                 A       E
 How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him,
.                F#m B      E
 Who brings good news, good news;
.E/G#       A         B                A    E
 Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness,
.        F#m   B         E      A E
 Our God reigns, our God reigns!
 
[C]
.        A               E      A E
 Our God reigns, our God reigns,
.E/G#    A     F#m       E      A E
 Our God reigns, our God reigns!
 
[V2]
.E/G#         A         B            A     E
 You watchmen lift your voices joyfully as one,
.               F#m  B               E
 Shout for your King, shout for your King;
.E/G#       A        B              A E
 See eye to eye, the Lord restoring Zion,
.        F#m   B         E      A
 Our God reigns, our God reigns!
 
[V3]
.E/G#       A        B                   A    E
 Out of the tomb, He came with grace and majesty,
.       F#m  B       E
 He is alive, He is alive;
.E/G#         A       B                   A         E
 God loves us so, see here His hands, His feet, His side,
.       F#m  B       E    A E
 Yes we know, He is alive.</lyrics>

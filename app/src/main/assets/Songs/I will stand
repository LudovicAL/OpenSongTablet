  <lyrics>[V1]
.       D             Bm            G               A 
 I will stand, I will stand, I will stand in Jesus' name 
.        D                   Bm            G               A
 For the things That God has given, I will stand in Jesus' name 
.        D              D7
 Satan's hosts may come against me
.       G             A
 I will not surrender ground 
.        D                   Bm  
 For the things that God has given
.        G                   A 
 For the things that God has given
.        D                   G             D 
 For the things that God has given, I will stand 
 
[V2]
 I will stand, I will stand, I will stand in Jesus' name
 In the armour God has given, I will stand in Jesus' name
 With the helmet shield and breastplate
 Feet well shod and sword in hand
 In the armour God has given
 In the armour God has given
 In the armour God has given, I will stand

[V3]
 I will stand, I will stand, I will stand in Jesus' name
 In His strength and by His power, I will stand in Jesus' name
 Against authorities of darkness
 Raise the standard of His blood
 In His strength and by His power
 God's a strong and mighty power
 Gaining victories by the hour, I will stand

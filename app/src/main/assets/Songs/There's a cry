.Am    G    Em Am    F  G

[V1]
.Am G/D       C           Dm7             C/E           F
    There's a cry that is rising from the depths of creation
.          C           Dm7           C/E           F
 There's a call on the lips of every people, every nation
.                    G                C  G/B   Am....
 It's the cry of the children for the Father's heart
.Em/G         F           G                  C   G/B    Am
     It's the call of the lost sheep for the Shepherd's voice...
.Em         Am                    G     Em         Am                 F   G
 Hear their cry from the depths O Lord, hear their cry from the depths O Lord

[V2]
 Like a tree by a river giving fruit in due season
 And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations
 You have planted a kingdom that shall never fall
 To the ends of the earth is Your salvation call
 Hear our cry from the depths O Lord, hear our cry from the depths O Lord
[C]
.(Em)      Am                        F
 Those who weep return with songs of joy, 
.         G                          Am
 You have turned their mourning into dancing
.(Em)      Am                          F
 Those who seek shall find the Lord of lords
.      G                        Am
 Jesus Christ desire of all the nations
[V3]
 As a watchman is waiting for the sun in it's dawning
 And his heart is rejoicing at the light of the morning
 So my soul waits for You and Your unfailing love
 For the Lord our Redeemer has become their hope
 Hear our cry from the depths O Lord, hear our cry from the depths O Lord
[B]

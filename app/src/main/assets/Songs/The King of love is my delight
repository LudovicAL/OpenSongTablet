  <lyrics>[V1]
.            F
 The King of love is my delight 
.             Gm
 His eyes are fire; His face is light 
.              C
 The First and Last, the Living One 
.            F Bb
 His name is Jesus 
.             F
 And from His mouth there comes a sound 
.                Gm
 That shakes the earth and splits the ground 
.            C
 And yet his voice is life to me 
.             F Bb
 The voice of Jesus 

[C]
.    F
 And I will sing my songs of love 
.Gm
 Calling out across the earth 
.     Bb                  C                F
 "The King has come, the King of love has come" 
.    F
 And troubled minds can know His peace, 
.Gm
 Captive hearts can be released 
.    Bb                  C                F
 The King has come, the King of love has come 

[V2]
 My Loverâ€™s breath is sweetest wine 
 I am His prize, and He is mine 
 How can a sinner know such joy 
 Because of Jesus 
 The wounds of love are in His Hands 
 The price is paid for sinful man 
 Accepted child, forgiven son 
 Because of Jesus 

[B]
.    C
 And my desire is to have You near 
.          Bb
 Lord, You know that You are welcome here 
.  C
 Before such love, before such grace 
.       Bb
 I will let the walls come down

  <lyrics>[V1]
. E                A/E       E 
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound 
.                         B/E
 That saved a wretch like me! 
.  E    E/G#          A        E 
 I once was lost, but now am found 
.              B/E   E 
 Was blind but now I see 
 
[V2]
 T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
 And grace my fears relieved; 
 How precious did that grace appear,
 The hour I first believed 
 
[C]
.   E/G#      A                    E/G# 
 My chains are gone, I've been set free 
.          A/C#                E/B 
 My God my Savior has ransomed me 
.    E/G#   A               E/G# 
 And like a flood His mercy reigns 
.         F#m7  B7         E 
 Unending love     Amazing Grace
 
[V3]
 The Lord has promised good to me, 
 His word my hope secures 
 He will my shield and portion be 
 As long as life endures 

;Chorus x2

[V4]
.    E                  A/E         E
 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, 
.                   B/E
 The sun forbear to shine; 
.    E        E/G#      A      E
 But God, who call'd me here below, 
.           B/E  E                B/E       E
 Will be forever mine, will be forever mine
.              B/E   E
 You are for - ever   mine.

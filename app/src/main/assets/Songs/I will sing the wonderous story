  <lyrics>[V1]
.       D                  A
 I will sing the wonderous story 
.                           D 
 Of the Christ who died for me 
.       D                A     
 How He left His Home in glory 

 For the cross on Calvary

[C]
.         G                  D
 Yes I'll sing the wonderous story
.       A                   D  D7
 Of the Christ who died for me
.        G                  D  
 Sing it with the Saints in glory
.         A              D  G  D  A
 Gathered by the crystal sea

[V2]
 I was lost but Jesus found me, 
 Found the sheep that went astray
 Threw His loving arms around me, 
 Drew me back into His way

[V3]
 I was bruised but Jesus healed me, 
 Faint was I from many a fall
 Sight was gone and fears possessed me, 
 But He freed me from them all

[V4]
 Days of darkness still come o'er me, 
 Sorrows path I often tread
 But the Saviour still is with me, 
 By His hand I'm safely led

[V5]
 He will keep me till the river 
 Rolls it's waters at my feet
 Then He'll bear me safely over 
 Where the loved ones I shall meet</lyrics>

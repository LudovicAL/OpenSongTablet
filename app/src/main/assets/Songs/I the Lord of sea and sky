.G             C/G     G    G      C/G      G      D
 I the Lord of sea and sky,|I have heard my people cry;
.G       Em       Am7  G/B C G/B Am    Am7/G     D/F#  D/C  G/B  D/A  D
 All who dwell in dark and sin,    |my hand will save.||
.G              C/G      G      G      C/G        G        D
 I who made the stars of night,|I will make their darkness bright.
.G        Em      Am7  G/B C  G/B Am   G/B     C      D
 Who will bear my light to them? |Whom shall I send?

[C]
.D/F#   G Gsus4 G G/B D/A G  C/E   G
 Here I am Lord.   Is  it I, Lord?
.       G         Am7     G/B    C      D   
 I have heard You calling in the night.
.       G   Gsus4 G        Gmaj7/F# C/E  G
 I will go, Lord,   if You lead     me;
.       G         Am7    D     G    C/G  G       Gmaj7/F#  C/E   D
 I will hold Your people in my heart.

[V2]
 I, the Lord of snow and rain,|I have borne my people's pain;
 I have wept for love of them, they turn away.||
 I will break their hearts of stone,|Give them hearts for love alone;
 I will speak my word to them. Whom shall I send?

[V3]
 I, the Lord of wind and flame,|I will tend the poor and lame;
 I will set a feast for them, my hand will save.||
 Finest bread I will provide,|Till their hearts are satisfied;
 I will give my life to them. Whom shall I send?</lyrics>

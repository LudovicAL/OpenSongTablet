[V1]
.D/F#   E/G#    A     A      Bm7     A/C# 
 Oh, to see the dawn, Of the darkest day, 
.D             A/C#    Bm7  E
 Christ on the road to Calvary.
.D/F#     E/G#   A    A        Bm7     A/C#
 Tried by sinful men, Torn and beaten, then, 
.D           A/C#  A  E
 Nailed to a cross of wood.
 
[C]
.A/C#      D     E      A      A/C#   D      E       A
 This, the power of the cross; Christ became sin for us.
.A/C#     D      B/D#     E     E7/D A/C#    D     Esus   A (D Bm7 E)
 Took the blame, bore the wrath, we stand forgiven at the cross.
 
[V2]
 Oh, to see the pain, written on your face, 
 Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
 Every bitter thought, Every evil deed, 
 Crowning Your bloodstained brow.

;First half of verse quiet
[V3]
 Now the daylight flees, Now the ground beneath, 
 Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
 Curtain torn in two, Dead are raised to life, 
 'Finished!' the victory cry.
 
[V4]
 Oh, to see my name, Written in the wounds, 
 For through Your suffering I am free.
 Death is crushed to death, Life is mine to live, 
 Won through Your selfless love.
 
[C2]
.A/C#      D     E      A      A/C#   D    E         A
 This, the power of the cross, Son of God, slain for us.
.A/C#   D     B/D#   E     E7/D A/C#   D     Esus   A (D Bm7 E)
 What a love! What a cost! We stand forgiven at the cross.

.A                     D    E  F#m
 Joy to the world, the Lord is come
.    D       E         F#m
 Let Earth receive her King
.    D     A/C#     D         A/C#
 Let every heart prepare Him room
.    F#m                          E
 And Heaven and nature sing, and Heaven and nature sing
.    D           F#m7        Bm7  E  A
 And Heaven, and Heaven and nature sing

[V2]
.A                     D  E    F#m
 Joy to the world, the Saviour reigns
.    D         E       F#m
 Let all their songs employ
.      D          A/C#            D         A/C#
 While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
.  F#m                       E
 Repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy
.  D      F#m7       Bm7  E   A
 Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

[C]
.D                 A           E               D
 Joy, unspeakable joy, an overflowing well, no tongue can tell
.D                 A         E                  D         (B to key change)
 Joy, unspeakable joy, rises in my soul,  never lets me go

[V3]
.B                       E     F#   G#m
 He rules the world with truth and grace
.    E         F#       G#m
 And makes the nations prove
.    E       B/D#    E       B/D#
 The glories of His righteousness
.    G#m                      F#
 And wonders of His love, and wonders of His love
.      E      G#m7    C#m7  F#  B
 And wonders, wonders of His love

[C]
.E                 B           F#               E
 Joy, unspeakable joy, an overflowing well, no tongue can tell
.E                 B         F#                 E          (B)
 Joy, unspeakable joy, rises in my soul,  never lets me go

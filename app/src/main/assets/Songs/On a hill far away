  <lyrics>[V1]
.     A                       D          
 On a hill far away, stood an old rugged cross,
.    E                       A     E
 The emblem of suffering and shame;
.      A                              D
 And I love that old cross, where the dearest and best
.      E                         A
 For a world of lost sinners was slain.

[C]
.        E                      A
 So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
.         D                      E
 'Till my trophies at last I lay down;
.       A                       D
 I will cling to the old rugged cross,
.      A              E         A
 And exchange it some day for a crown.

[V2]
 O, the old rugged cross, so despised by the world
 Has a wondrous attraction for me;
 For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
 To bear it to dark Calvary.

[V3]
 In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine
 A wondrous beauty I see;
 For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died
 To pardon and sanctify me.

[V4]
 To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
 It's shame and reproach gladly bear;
 Then He'll call me someday to my home far away,
 When His glory for ever I'll share.</lyrics>

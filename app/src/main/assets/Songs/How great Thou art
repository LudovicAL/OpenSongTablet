. C                                     F
1 Oh Lord my        God, when I in      awesome wonder
2 When through the  woods, and forest   glades I wander,
3 And when I        think that God, His Son not sparing
4 When Christ shall come with shout of  acclamation
.              C2/G       Em/G       Dm/G  G    C
1 Consider     all the    works  Thy hands have made;
2 And hear the birds sing sweetly    in the     trees;
3 Sent Him to  die, I     scarce can take it    in;
4 And take me  home, what joy shall  fill my    heart;
.   G       C                  F
1 I see the stars, I hear the  mighty thunder:
2 When I look down from lofty  mountain grandeur,
3 That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
4 Then shall I bow in humble   adoration,
.                 C2/G      Em/G     Dm/G  G     C
1 Thy pow'r throughout the  uni______verse dis__played.
2 And hear the    brook and feel the gentle     breeze.
3 He bled and     died to   take a___way my     sin.
4 And there pro___claim my  God how  great Thou art!
 
[C]
.     F/G      C2      F              C2
 Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee,
.               G    G/B           C2
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art;
.     F/G      C2      F              C2
 Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee,
.               G        Dm    G    C2
 How great Thou art, how great Thou art.

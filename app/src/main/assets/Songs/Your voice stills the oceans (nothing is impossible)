.Em         C                 G        D/F#
 Your voice stills the ocean, one word heals the broken
.Em            C              G       D
 Your power is uncontainable, Awesome God
.Em            C                 G          D/F#
 Such strength born in weakness, your life lights the darkness
.Em           C               G       D
 You died and rose a miracle, Awesome God
 
[P]
.Am    Em D        Am      Em D
 Jesus we believe, Saviour we believe
 
[C]
.C                      G            D/F#
 Nothing is impossible, Nothing is impossible
.C                         G D/F#
 Nothing is impossible for you
.C                           D           Em
 Youâ€™re the God of miracles, Risen and Invincible
.C                         G D
 Nothing is impossible for you
 
[V2]
 You speak: mountains tremble, one move: kings are humbled
 Your plans are undefeatable, Awesome God
 We know if God is for us, who can be against us?
 You make us more than conquerors, Awesome God
 Jesus we believe, Saviour we believe

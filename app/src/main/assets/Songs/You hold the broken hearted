  <lyrics>[V1]
.B                     E     F#
 You hold the broken hearted
.B                     E     F#
 You stand beside the weak
.B                     E     F#
 You go to those in darkness
.G#m            E  F#
 And so must we
 
[V2]
 Your heart is for the outcast
 For those we call the least
 You lift the broken spirit
 And so must we
 
[C]
.       B              F#/Bb
 God of hope, God of futures
.       E              F#                G#m   F#/Bb
 You can take a broken heart and make it sing
.       B              F#/Bb
 God of life, new tomorrows
.        E               F#                G#m   F#/Bb
 You can shine the light that changes everything
 
[V3]
 You go to those forgotten
 The faces we don't see
 You give your live to save them
 And so must we
 
[B]
.        Ebm            E
 God who speaks, opens graves
.         F#            G#m
 With one word, our God saves!</lyrics></song>

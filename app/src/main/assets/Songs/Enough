 All of You is more than enough for

 All of me, for every thirst and every need,
.C2/E     Dsus C          G/B
 You satisfy me with Your love,
.    C2            Dsus   C2         (G   C2/E   Dsus  C) x2
 And all I have in You is more than enough.

2Still more awesome than I know!

 More than all I can see,

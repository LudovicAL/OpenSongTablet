.A      D
[V1]
.A            D                          A
 One day when Heaven was filled with His praises, 
.A            D                         A
 One day when sin was as black as could be,
.A          D                     A
 Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin, 
.A           D                  Bm7
 Dwelt among men, my example is He
.                D              
 The Word became flesh and
.                 F#m                  D (E other verses)
 The light shined among us, His glory revealed

[C]
.          A                  E                               
 Living He loved me, dying He saved me, 
.          F#m                 D
 Buried He carried my sins far away
.           A                  E
 Rising He justified freely forever, 
.             F#m                  D               A  D  A   D  E
 One day He’s coming, oh glorious day, oh glorious day (oh glorious day)

[V2]
 One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain, 
 One day they nailed Him to die on a tree
 Suffering anguish, despised and rejected, 
 Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He
 Hands that healed nations, 
 Stretched out on a tree, and took the nails for me

[V3]
 One day the grave could conceal Him no longer, 
 One day the stone rolled away from the door
 Then He arose, over death He had conquered, 
 Now He’s ascended, my Lord evermore
 Death could not hold Him, 
 The grave could not keep Him from rising again
[B]
.D           A            E             F#m
 One day the trumpet will sound for His coming, 
.D           A              E           C#m
 One day the skies with His glories will shine,
.D         A         E            F#m 
 Wonderful day, my Beloved One, bringing, 
.D                     D
 My Saviour, Jesus, is mine </lyrics>

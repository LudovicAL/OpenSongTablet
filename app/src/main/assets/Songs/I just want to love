  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bb             F     Gm             Eb
 I just want to love,|I just want to sing
.Bb          F             Gm                   Eb
 To the One above,|Who has touched this thirsty soul
.        Cm                Eb
 And now I'll never be the same
 
[C]
.Bb          F         Gm          Eb                Bb
 I'll always love You,|I'll always sing to You, Jesus
.          F              Gm            Eb
 I long to worship You|in Spirit and in truth
 
[V2]
 Everyday I'll come,|Spend my life with You
 Learning of Your heart,|And what You're calling me to do
 My every breathe belongs to You
 
[B]
.Cm            Bb/D                         Eb
 And with this song,|We'll lift the name of Jesus higher
.Cm         Bb/D                      Eb
 And with a shout,|We'll raise up one voice</lyrics>

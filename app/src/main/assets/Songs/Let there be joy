  <lyrics>[C]
 Let there be joy, let there peace
 Let there be power, let there be praise
 Let there joy, joy in the Holy Ghost
 It was freedom that we were set free
 Let every mountain be cast to the sea
 Let there joy, joy in the Holy Ghost

[V1]
 We will declare it to the heavens
 The righteous of God in which we stand
 We will proclaim it to the nations
 Every eye shall see, every ear shall hear
 Every heart shall understand</lyrics></song>

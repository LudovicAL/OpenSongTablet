  <lyrics>[V1]
.   G       C        G
 An army of ordinary people,
.  Em            Em/D        C
 A kingdom where love is the key,
.  Am7                  G
 A city, a light to the nations,
.C            Am7         D  D7
 Heirs to the promise are we.
.  G            C          G
 A people whose life is in Jesus,
.  Em     Em/D        C
 A nation together we stand.
.Am7                       G
 Only through grace are we worthy,
.Am    D7          G
 Inheritors of the land.

[C]
.             C         D
 A new day is dawning,
.             G    D/F#  Em
 A new age to come,
.         Em7/D       C
 When the children of promise
.D7                     G
 Shall flow together as one.
.               C       D
 A truth long neglected,
.                     G   D/F#  Em
 But the time has now come
.         Em7/D       C
 When the children of promise
.D7                     G
 Shall flow together as one.

[V2]
 A people without recognition,
 But with Him a destiny sealed,
 Called to a heavenly vision,
 His purpose shall be fulfilled.
 Come, let us stand strong together,
 Abandon ourselves to the King,
 His love shall be ours forever,
 This victory song we shall sing.</lyrics>

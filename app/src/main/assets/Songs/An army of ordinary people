  <lyrics>[V1]
.   G       C        G         Em            Em/D        C
 An army of ordinary people,|A kingdom where love is the key,
.  Am7                  G        C            Am7         D  D7
 A city, a light to the nations,|Heirs of the promise are we.
.  G            C          G        Em     Em/D        C
 A people whose life is in Jesus,|A nation together we stand.
.Am7                       G       Am    D7          G
 Only through grace are we worthy,|Inheritors of the land.

[C]
.             C      D              G    D/F#  Em
 A new day is dawning,|A new age to come,
.         Em7/D       C        D7                     G
 When the children of promise,|Shall flow together as one.
.               C      D                      G   D/F#  Em
 A truth long neglected,|But the time has now come
.         Em7/D       C        D7                     G
 When the children of promise,|Shall flow together as one.

[V2]
.G            C        G           Em         Em/D    C
 A people without recognition,|But with Him a destiny sealed,
.Am7                  G       C           Am7         D
 Called to a heavenly vision,|His purpose shall be fulfilled.
.G            C              G        Em        Em/D          C
 Come, let us stand strong together,|Abandon ourselves to the King,
.    Am7                   G     Am           D7            G
 His love shall be ours forever,|This victory song we shall sing.

  <lyrics>[V1]
.        A    D/A      A             E    D       A 
 Far and near hear the call, worship Him, Lord of all; 
.    A       D/A     A         E          D       A  
 Families of nations come, celebrate what God has done.

[V2]
.         A    D/A    A           E    D     A 
 Deep and wide is the love heaven sent from above; 
.          A       D/A     A          E         D   A 
 God's own Son for sinners died, rose again, He is alive 

[C]
.Esus4  A  A7/C#        D
 Say it loud,    say it strong,
.         B7    D/E          A
 Tell the world what God has done;
.Esus4  A  A7/C#            D
 Say it loud,    praise His name,
.                B7    D/E          A      (E to repeat)
 Let the earth rejoice for the Lord reigns.

[V3]
.       A        D/A      A           E     D      A 
 At His name let praise begin, oceans roar, nature sing.
.       A        D/A       A                 E        D      A 
 For He comes to judge the earth in righteousness and in His truth.</lyrics>

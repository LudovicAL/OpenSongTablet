.D                F#m             Bm       Em7         A
 Be still for the presence of the Lord the Holy One is here
.D          F#m      Bm        Em7           A
 Come bow before Him now, with reverence and fear||
.G         D             G           D
 In Him no sin is found, we stand on Holy ground
.G  A             F#m             Bm       Em7  A      D   Em A
 Be still for the presence of the Lord the Holy One is here

[V2]
.D                F#m          Bm      Em7          A
 Be still for the glory of the Lord is shining all around
.D             F#m  Bm         Em7             A
 He burns with Holy fire, with splendour He is crowned||
.G           D             G           D
 How awesome is the sight, our radiant King of light
.G  A             F#m          Bm      Em7     A    D    Em A
 Be still for the glory of the Lord is shining all around

[V3]
.D                F#m          Bm      Em7            A
 Be still for the power of the Lord is moving in this place
.D           F#m         Bm       Em7          A
 He comes to cleanse and heal, to minister His grace||
.G           D             G          D
 No work too hard for Him, in faith receive from Him
.G  A             F#m          Bm      Em7    A       D   Em A
 Be still for the power of the Lord is moving in this place</lyrics>

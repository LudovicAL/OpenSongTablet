  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                                   D/F#
 Did you feel the mountains tremble,|Did you hear the oceans roar
.D/B                             D/F#             Esus4 A
 When the people rose to sing of|Jesus Christ the risen One?
 
[V2]
 Did you feel the people tremble,|Did you hear the singers roar
 When the lost began to sing of|Jesus Christ the saving One?
 
[P1]
.           D/F#                A
 And we can see that God You're moving
.         D/F#              A
 A mighty river through the nations
.              D/F#             A
 And young and old will turn to Jesus
.D/B
 Fling wide you heavenly gates
.D                      Esus4 A   E
 Prepare the way of the risen Lord
 
[C]
.A                     D/F#
 Open up the doors and let the music play
.D/B                          A      E
 Let the streets resound with singing
.A                           D/F#
 Songs that bring Your hope, songs that bring Your joy
.D/B                      A      E
 Dancers who dance upon injustice
 
[V3]
 Do you feel the darkness tremble|When all saints join in one song
 And all the streams flow as one river|To wash away our brokenness
 
[P2]
 And here we see that God You're moving,|A time of jubilee is coming
 When young and old return to Jesus
 Fling wide you heavenly gates,|Prepare the way of the risen Lord</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Gm  C  Gm  C  Gm  C  Gm

[V1]
.Gm          C        Gm   C    Gm  C       Gm  C
 Well no one told me about her, the way she lied
.Gm          C        Gm   C    Gm       C      G7
 Well no one told me about her, how many people cried

[C]
.             C       Cm         Gm
 But it's too late to say you're sorry
.            D7    Gm           Gm7
 How would I know, why should I care
.             C      Cm        Gm                  D7
 Please don't bother trying to find her, she's not there
.                               Gm            C
 Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
.              Gm       C             Gm
 The way she'd act, the colour of her hair
.C             Gm             C             Gm              C
 Her voice was soft and cool, her eyes were clear and bright
.              G
 But she's not there

[BREAK]
.Gm  C  Gm  C  Gm  C  Gm

[V2]
 Well no one told me about her, what I could do
 Well no one told me about her, though they all knew

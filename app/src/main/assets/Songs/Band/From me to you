  <title>From me to you</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.           G                 Em   
 If there's anything that you want, 
.           G              D
 If there's anything I can do
.     C7                  Em
 Just call on me and I'll send it along,
.     G         D7    G   D
 With love from me to you

[V2]
 I've got everything that you want, 
 Like a heart that's oh so true
 Just call on me and I'll send it along, 
 With love from me to you

[Mid 8]
.      Dm7               G7
 I got arms that long to hold you, 
.    C              C7
 And keep you by my side
.      Em7               A7
 I got lips that long to kiss you, 
.    D7            D7+
 And keep you satisfied - ooh

[V3]
 If there's anything that you want, 
 If there's anything I can do
 Just call on me and I'll send it along, 
 With love from me to you</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G   D   D/C  D/B  D/A     G   D   D/C  D/B  D/A

[V1]
.G                    Bm                          C
 Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly
.        C  G/B  C    D
 And the spiders from Mars
.                  G        D/F#        Em
 He played it left hand but made it too far
.           Am                                C
 Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

[V2]
 Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
 Like some cat from Japan
 He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang
 Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan

[C]
.Am G              F       Am        G            F
 So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls
.Am            G             F
 With just the beer light to guide us
.      D                                    E
 So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

;BREAK as INTRO

[V3]
 Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
 The kid was just crass
 He was the nazz, with God given ass
 He took it all too far, but boy could he play guitar

;CHORUS

[Mid 8]
.Am     G             F    Am    G         F
 Making love with his ego, Ziggy sucked up into his mind
.Am     G       F               D
 Like a leper messiah, when the kids had killed the man
.         E
 I had to break up the band

;OUTRO as INTRO x2
;Oooh yeah       (Ziggy played guitar)</lyrics>

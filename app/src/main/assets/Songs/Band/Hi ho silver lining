  <title>Hi ho silver lining</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.       D                              G
 You're everywhere and no where, baby, thats where you're at,
.C                  G         D             A
 Going down a bumpy hillside, in your hippy hat.
.D                             G
 Flying out across the country and getting fat
.C                    G      D                   A
 Saying everything is groovy when your tyres are flat

[C]
.        D     D7
 And its hi ho silver lining 
.G              A      G A
 Everywhere you go now baby,
.D          D7
 I see your sun is shining, 
.G                 A      G       D
 But I wont make a fuss, 'cos its obvious.

[V2]
 Flies are in your pea soup baby, they're waving at me
 Anything you want is yours now only nothing is for free.
 Lies are gonna get you some day just wait and see.
 So open up your beach umbrella while you are watching TV

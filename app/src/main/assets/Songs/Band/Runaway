.Am   G   F   E

[V1]
.Am                G                                  
 As I walk along I wonder a-what went wrong
.     F                            E7
 With our love, a love that was so strong
.Am                        G          
 And as I still walk on, I think of the things we've done
.  F                               E7
 Together, a-while our hearts were young

[C]
.A
 I'm a-walkin' in the rain, 
.F#m
 Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
.A
 Wishin' you were here by me, 
.F#m
 To end this misery
.A                           F#m
 And I wonder, I wa-wa-wa-wa-wonder
.A                       F#m
 Why  Ah-why-why-why-why-why she ran away
.      D                     E7
 And I wonder where she will stay
.          A        D                  A    (E7)
 My little runaway, run-run-run-run-runaway

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.A   E/G#   F#m   F#m/E
.D   Esus4  E     A 

[V1] 
.A         E/G#    F#m  F#m/E  D    A          E 
 Would you know my name,       if I saw you in heaven? 
.A        E/G#   F#m  F#m/E  D    A          E 
 Would it be the same,       if I saw you in heaven? 
.F#m       C#m/F   A7/E      F#7 
 I must be strong, and carry on, 
.         Bm7            D/E          A  E/G# ... (As INTRO) 
 'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven. 

[V2]
 Would you hold my hand, if I saw you in heaven? 
 Would you help me stand, if I saw you in heaven? 
 I'll find my way, through night and day, 
 'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven. 

[Mid 8]
.C        G/B       Am7 
 Time can bring you down, 
.         D/F#      G  D/F#  Em   D/F# G 
 Time can bend your knees 
.C        G/B        Am7 
 Time can break your heart 
.             D/F#    G  D/F#        E 
 And have you beggin, please, beggin please 

[INSTR]
.A   E/G#   F#m   F#m/E   D   A   E

[T]
.F#m        C#/F  A7/E              F#7 
 Beyond the door, there's peace I'm sure; 
.      Bm7                 D/E           A    E/G##... (As INTRO) 
 And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven. 

[V3]
 Would you know my name, if I saw you in heaven? 
 Would it be the same, if I saw you in heaven? 
 I must be strong, and carry on, 
 'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven. 
 'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven.</lyrics>

[Intro]
 Bass/Piano riff

[V1]
.  Am                                 E/G#                         E        Am
 I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay, ain't it sad
.    Am                              E/G#                      E          Am
 And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me, that's too bad
.Dm/A  Am       E/A    Am  G F                     F  F/E
 In my dreams I have a plan, if I got me a wealthy man
.  Dm                                B/D#                   E7
 I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...

[C]
.Am                   B              Dm     E7         Am
 Money, money, money, must be funny, in the rich man's world
.Am                   B             Dm     E7         Am
 Money, money, money, always sunny, in the rich man's world
.Dm   E     A                      Dm  F  E7 Am                  Dm     E7         Am
 Aha-ahaaa, all the things I could do, if I  had a little money, it's a rich man's world

;SUPER TROUPER

[Intro]
.G      G      Em      Am      Am      D      D

[V1]
.G			     Bm             Am                         D
 I was sick and tired of everything, when I called you last night from Glasgow
.G                             Bm            Am                 D
 All I do is eat and sleep and sing, wishing every show was the last show
.C                G/B                         C                 G/B 
 So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming, suddenly I feel alright
.C                    G          		       Dsus4  D
 And it's gonna be so different, when I'm on the stage tonight

[C]
.            G     Gsus4   G 
 Tonight the Super trouper lights are gonna find me
.Gsus4   G        D    Am              D    		      G
 Shining like the sun, smiling, having fun, feeling like a number one
.            G     Gsus4   G
 Tonight the Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
.Gsus4 G          D    Am            D   				       G
 But I won't feel blue like I always do, 'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

;KNOWING ME, KNOWING YOU
[Intro - keyboard]
.G      Bm      C      D      G      Bm      C

[C]
.D G         C       D                                     G           C           D
 Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa), there is nothing we can do, knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)
.                              G    C     D
 We just have to face it, this time we're through
.G        G/B         C       D          G    C  D           G           C             D          (G)
 Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go, knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do
 
[Outro - keyboard]
.G      Bm      C      D      G      Bm      C      C......

;THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL
[V]
.              C                        G/B                               Dm/A         G
 I don't wanna talk, about things we've gone through, though it's hurting me, now it's history
.                   C                             G/B                       Dm/A                G
 I've played all my cards, and that's what you've done too, nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[C]
.                    C                E/G#     Am
 The winner takes it all, the loser's standing small
.           A7/C# Dm                 G
 Beside the victory, that's her destiny
.                       C                    E/B     Am
 The gods may throw the dice, their minds as cold as ice
.            A7/C#    Dm                  G
 And someone way down here, loses someone dear

;SOS
[C]
.C              G        Dm                F       C  Csus4 C  C  Csus4 C
 So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me S.O.S.
.C            G        Dm               F       C  Csus4  C
 The love you gave me, nothing else can save me S.O.S.
.            F             Ab     Bb        C
 When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
.            F              Ab          Bb      C     .....  (D.....)
 When you're gone, though I try how can I carry on?

[C]
.D...                       A                                         D
 There was something in the air that night, the stars were bright, Fernando
.                            A                           D
 They were shining there for you and me, for liberty, Fernando
.          C                           B7                 E7

.                   A                                  D
 If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando    x2

[T]
.                   A                                  D
 If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando
.                   A                                  G   G/B   A/C#  D
 If I had to do the same again, I would, my friend, Fernando

  <lyrics>;PART OF A MEDLEY

[V]
.              C                        G/B
 I don't wanna talk, about things we've gone through
.                    Dm/A         G
 Though it's hurting me, now it's history
.                   C                             G/B
 I've played all my cards, and that's what you've done too
.                Dm/A                G
 Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[C]
.                    C                E/G#     Am
 The winner takes it all, the loser's standing small
.           A7/C# Dm                 G
 Beside the victory, that's her destiny
.                       C                    E/B     Am
 The gods may throw the dice, their minds as cold as ice
.            A7/C#    Dm                  G
 And someone way down here, loses someone dear

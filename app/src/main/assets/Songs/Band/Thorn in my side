.D                                G               A 
 A bundle of lies you know that's all that it was worth... 
.D                   C            G              A 
 I should have known better but I trusted you at first.

.C  F                   C                    G                C 
 To run away from you, (Run run run run) was all that I could do, (Run run run run)

 To run away from you, (Run run run run) was all that I could do, (Run run run run) 
.C  F             C        A7               D 
 To run away from you, was all that I could do 

[V2]
 Thorn in my side you know that's all you'll ever be 
 So don't think you know better'cause that's what you mean to me 
 I was feeling complicated I was feeling low 
 Now everytime I think of you I shiver to the bone... Whoa Whoa Whoa Who....etc

.C  F             C        A7               Bb 
 To run away from you, was all that I could do

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G   D  Em   D

[V1]
.C                  Am
 Yesterday, well it seemed so cool  
.       F                  G
 When I walked you home, I kissed goodnight   
.F                   G
 Said it's love, you said alright 
.     C                  Am 
 It's funny how, I could never cry 
.  F                G              F                  G
 Until tonight, and you passed by, hand in hand with another guy 
.F                    G
 Dressed to kill, and guess who's dying            

[C]
.D              Bm         G              A 
 Dance away the heartache, dance away the tears        
.D              Bm         G              A 
 Dance away the heartache, dance away the tears 
.G
 Dance away 

[V2]
 Loneliness, is a crowded room 
 Full of open hearts, turned to stone all together, all alone 
 All at once, my whole world has changed
 Now I'm in the dark of the wall let the stobe light up them all         
 Close my eyes and dance till dawn 

;CHORUS 

;DRUM BREAK 

[MID 8]
.C   C F G     C   C F G  

[V3]
 Now I know, I must walk the line
 Till I find an open door, off the street onto the floor 
 There was I, many times a fool 
 I hope and pray, but not too much, out of reach, out of touch         
 All the way is far enough 

;CHORUS   x2 

[Outro]

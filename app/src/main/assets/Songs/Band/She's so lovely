.C F        Dm      G         C
 I love the way she feels her clothes

 She looks just like them girls in vogue
;THRASH

 I think that she is beautiful

[C]
.C                F                           
 She's so lovely, she's so lovely, 
.Dm               G......
 She's so lovely, she's so lovely    x2

[V2]
;SLOW START
 She's pretty and fitty
 She's got a boyfriend though and that's a pity
 She's flirty turned thirty 
 Ain't that the age a girl gets really dirty

[Mid 8]
.F             C/E           Dm
 I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
.C
 How we'll make it though this
.F             C/E           Dm      C
 I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

[V3]
;FAST
 I love the way she bites her lip
 I love the way she shakes them hips
 I love the way she makes me drool
 I think that she is beautiful

;CHORUS

[V4]
 A stunner, I want her,
 Was she this fit when she was ten years younger
 Come see me discretely, 
 She says she's got a trick or two to teach me

;MID 8 x2 (I don't know..)

[V5]
;FAST
 I think that you are lovely,
 I think that you are lovely (beautiful)   x4

;CHORUS

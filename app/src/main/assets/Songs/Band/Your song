  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Eb       Abmaj7/Eb        Bb/Eb         Abmaj7/Eb                                

[V1]
.Eb                Abmaj7/Eb  Bb/D           Gm                
 It's a little bit funny,     this feeling inside,
.Cm             Cm/Bb           Cm/A   Ab
 I'm not one of those, who can, easily hide.              
.Eb/Bb             Bb          G/B      Cm
 I don't have much money, but, boy if I did,              
.Eb            Fm7             Ab         Bb   Bb
 I'd buy a big house where, we both could live.
.Eb         Abmaj7/Eb  Bb/D           Gm
 If I was a sculptor,  but then again no,                  
.     Cm             Cm/Bb         Cm/A      Ab
 Or a man, who makes potions in a, travelin' show,        
.Eb/Bb           Bb                G/B         Cm
 I know it's not much but it's the best, I can do.        
.Eb            Fm7            Ab        Eb                 
 My gift is my song and, this one's for you.              

[C]
.Bb/D             Cm         Fm           Ab
 And you can tell everybody, this is your song.
.Bb/D      Cm                Fm            Ab
 It may be quite simple but, now that it's done,
.Cm                     Cm/Bb
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind, 
.Cm/A               Fm/Ab
 That I put down in words,
.    Eb/G      Fm             Ab            Bb    Bb
 How wonderful life is, while you're in the world.

.Eb       Abmaj7/Eb        Bb/Eb         Abmaj7/Eb                                

[V2]
.Eb           Abmaj7/Eb Bb/D           Gm                
 I sat on the roof, and kicked off the moss.                   
.        Cm         Cm/Bb   Cm/A                 Ab
 Well a, few of the verses, they've got me quite cross.        
.Eb/Bb              Bb          G/B                Cm
 But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song.       
.Eb                   Fm7       Ab             Bb   Bb
 It's for people like you that, keep it turned on.
.Eb            Abmaj7/Eb  Bb/D               Gm
 So excuse me forgettin', but these things I do,               
.    Cm           Cm/Bb              Cm/A             Ab
 You see, I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue.    
.Eb/Bb       Bb        G/B           Cm
 Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean,                     
.Eb            Fm7            Ab        Eb                 
 Yours are the sweetest eyes, I've ever seen.                  

[C]
.Bb/D             Cm         Fm           Ab
 And you can tell everybody, this is your song.
.Bb/D      Cm                Fm            Ab
 It may be quite simple but, now that it's done,
.Cm                     Cm/Bb
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind, 
.Cm/A               Fm/Ab
 That I put down in words,
.    Eb/G      Fm             Ab            Bb    Bb
 How wonderful life is, while you're in the world.
.Cm                     Cm/Bb
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind, 
.Cm/A               Fm/Ab
 That I put down in words,
.    Eb/G      Fm             Ab            Eb
 How wonderful life is, while you're in the world.

  <lyrics>[Intro]
.E  B/D#  C#m   F#m  E  B/D#
 
[V1]
.        E              B/D#         C#m
 All the times that you rain on my parade
.            F#m              E        B/D#
 And all the clubs you get in using my name
.              E                  B/D#         C#m
 You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
.              F#m            E         B/D#
 You think I'm crying, oh my oh, well I ain't
.                   E            B/D#                C#m
 And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
.  F#m        E                B/D#
 I don't but, you still hit my phone up
.                 E         B/D#            C#m
 And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
.              F#m        E                B/D#
 I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
 
 
[P]
.              C#m      A                  E
 My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
.            C#m     A                E
 And I never like to admit that I was wrong
.                 C#m             A           E                B
 And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
.          C#m   A          B
 And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
 
 
[C]
.             E        B       C#m        A
 Cause if you like the way you look that much
.        E                 A        E
 Oh baby you should go and love yourself
.           E          B         C#m     A
 And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
.E                 A        E
 You should go and love yourself
 
 
[V2]
 But when you told me that you hated my friends
 The only problem was with you and not them
 And every time you told my opinion was wrong
 And tried to make me forget where I came from
 And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
 I don't but, you still hit my phone up
 And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
 I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
 
;Prechorus
 
;Chorus
 
[Instrumental]
.E  B  C#m  A    E  B  E   x2
 
[V3]
 For all the times you made me feel small
 I fell in love, now I fear nothin' at all
 I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
 Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
 
;Chorus x2

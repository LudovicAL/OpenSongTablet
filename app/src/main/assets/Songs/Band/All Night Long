.G  F (x2)
 
[V1]
.G                      F                 Am                      G
  Well, my friends; the time has come, to raise the roof and have some fun
.G                F               Am             G
  Throw away, the work to be done; let the music play on.
.G                F                Am                 G
  Everybody sing, everybody dance; Lose your self in wild romance.
.G                              F                Am            G
 We're going to; party, Karamu, Fiesta, forever; Come on and sing along.
.G                              F                Am            G
 We're going to; party, Karamu, Fiesta, forever; Come on and sing along.

  All night long, (all night), all night, (all night).  All night long, (all night), all night, (all night).
 
[V2]
  People dancing, all in the streets, See the rhythm flow, in their feet
  Life is cool, wild and sweet; let the music play on.
 Feel it in your heart and feel it in your soul; Let the music take control.
 Were going to; party, Niming, Fiesta, forever; Come on and sing my song.
  
[Chorus]

  Come join the fun; it's a merry-go-round.
.G           C             G          Dm
  Everyone's dancing their troubles a-way.

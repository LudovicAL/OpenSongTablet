  <lyrics>[Intro]
.Bm    E

[V1]
.A             D     E
 Everything is open, nothing is set in stone
.A              D       E
 Rivers turn to oceans, oceans tide you home
.A                 D            E
 Home is where the heart is but your heart had to roam
.A             D       E
 Drifting over bridges never to return
.E
 Watching bridges burn 

[C]
.       A          E            Bm
 You're driftwood floating underwater
.              D
 Breaking into pieces, pieces, pieces
.     A          E             Bm
 Just driftwood, hollow and of no use
.                D  
 Waterfalls will find you, bind you, grind you 

[V2]
 Nobody is an island, everyone has to go
 Pillars turn to butter, butterflying low
 Low is where your heart is, but your heart has to grow
 Drifting under bridges, never with the flow 

[B]
.        Bm                           E
 And you really didn't think it would happen
.       Bm                       E
 But it really is the end of the line
.       A     E                     Bm
 So I'm sorry that you've turned to driftwood
.                D                       A
 But you've been drifting for a long long time

[Instr]
.Bm   E    Bm    E     Bm    E      Bm    Bm

[V3]
 Everywhere there's trouble, nowhere's safe to go
 Pushes turn to shovels, shovelling the snow
 Frozen you have chosen, the path you wish to go
 Drifting now forever and forever more
 Until you reach your shore

[C]

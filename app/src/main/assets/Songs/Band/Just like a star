  <lyrics>[V1]
.            Fmaj7                             E7b9 
 Just like a star across my sky,  just like an angel off the page
.          Am9                                Am6
 You have appeared to my life, feel like I'll never be the same
.            Dm7                         E7b9
 Just like a song in my heart, just like oil on my hand
.        Am7     Bbmaj7  C9
 Oh I do love you

[C]
.               Fmaj7                    E    E7/G# 
 Still I wonder why it is, I don't argue like this 
.     Am7    Gm7 C9
 With anyone but you
.                 Fmaj7                E
 We do it all the time, blowing out my mind

[V2]
.             Dm7                                E7b9
 You got this look I can't describe, you make me feel I'm alive
.                Am9                      Am6
 When everything else is a fade without a doubt you're on my side
.                Dm7                           E7b9
 Heaven has been away too long, can't find the words to write this song
.          Am7   Bbmaj7  C9
 Oh...your love

 Nah, nah, nah .................
.       Dm7                    E7b9               Am9
 I have come to understand the way it is is not a secret anymore
.             Gm7
 'Cause we've been through that before, 
.Dm7                      E7b9
 From tonight I know that you're the only one
.             Am9                    Gm7         C9
 I've been confused and in the dark, now I understand
.Fmaj7   E7b9    Am9    Gm7   C9
 Yeah....

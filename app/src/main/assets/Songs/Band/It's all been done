 I met you, before the fall of Rome
.           D           G     Em           Asus4   A 
 And I begged you, to let me take you home 
.         D          D+ 
 You were wrong, I was right  
.  Bm         D7 
 You said goodbye, I said goodnight (Oooooh)  
.G  Bm        G       D 
 It’s all been done (Oooooh), it’s all been done (Oooooh)  
.G  Em   A7 (Descending Bass) 
 It’s all been do-------------ne bef---------ore   

[V2]
.D   G Em         Asus4      A
 I knew you, before the west was won
.D G  Em     Asus4   A 
 And I heard you say the past was much more fun

 You go your way, I’ll go mine     
. Bm      D7  
 But I’ll see, you next time (Oooooh)

[Mid 8]
. D         D+       Bm D7 
 If I put my fingers here, and if I say ‘I love you dear’        
.   G         A7   
 And if I play the same three chords          
.  Bm         *  * 
 Will you just yawn and say ‘Aaah’ (Oooooh) 
.  G  Bm       G       D  
 It’s all been done (Oooooh), it’s all been done (Oooooh)   
.G  Em        A7 (Descending Bass)  
 It’s all been do---------ne be----------fore

 Alone and bored on a thirtieth century night

 Will I see you, on ‘The Price Is Right’
.       D           D+           Bm           D7
 Will I cry, will I smile as you run down the aisle (Oooooh)

 It’s all been done (Oooooh), it’s all been done (Oooooh)

 It’s all been do---------ne   (Oooooh)

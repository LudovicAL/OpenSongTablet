 Don't look back, and I love you

 You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah

 Well you're slim and you're weak, 
.               A                   E
 You've got the teeth of the Hydra upon you

 You're dirty, sweet, and you're my girl

 Get it on, Bang a gong, Get it on

[V2]
 You're built like a car, you've got a hub cap 
 Diamond star halo
 You're built like a car, oh yeah
 Well, you're an untamed youth, that's the truth,
 With your cloak full of eagles
 You're dirty, sweet, and you're my girl
 	
[V3]
 You're windy and wild, you've got the blues 
 In your shoes and your stockings
 You're windy and wild, oh yeah
 Well, you're built like a car, you've got a hub cap 
 Diamond star halo
 You're dirty, sweet, and you're my girl

[V4]
 You're dirty and sweet, clad in black, 
 Don't look back, and I love you
 You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
 Well, you dance when you walk, so lets dance, 
 Take a chance, understand me
 You're dirty, sweet, and you're my girl</lyrics>

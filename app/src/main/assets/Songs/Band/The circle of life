.Bb    Bbsus4  Bb  etc

[V1]
.         Bb                   Cm7/Bb      F/A                     Bb
 From the day we arrive on the planet, and blinking, step into the sun
.        Gm                       Cm                    Ab                  F
 There's more to be seen than can ever be seen, more to do than can ever be done
.Bb                 Cm7/Bb F/A                   Bb
 Some say eat or be eaten, some say live and let live
.    Gm                     Cm7                           Ab                       F
 But all are agreed as they join the stampede, you should never take more than you give

[C]
.                 Bb Eb/Bb Bb                  Cm7/Bb
 In the circle of life,      it's the wheel of fortune
.                 Eb                      F/A
 It's the leap of faith, it's the band of hope
.                 Bb/D  G             Cm7     Gb
 Till we find our place on the path unwinding yeah
.       Bb/F    F             Eb/Bb  Bb  
 In the circle, the circle of life

[V2]
 Some of us fall by the wayside and some of us soar to the stars
 And some of us sail through our troubles and some have to live with the scars
 There's far too much to take in here, more to find than can ever be found
 But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky, 
 Keeps great and small on the endless round

[C2]
.                 Bb Eb/Bb Bb                  Cm7/Bb
 In the circle of life,      it's the wheel of fortune
.                 Eb                      F/A
 It's the leap of faith, it's the band of hope
.                 Bb/D  G             Cm7     Gb
 Till we find our place on the path unwinding yeah
.       Bb/F    F             Bb  Eb/Bb Bb                Cm/Bb 
 In the circle, the circle of life,     it's the wheel of fortune
.                 Eb                      F/A
 It's the leap of faith, it's the band of hope
.                 Bb/D  G             Cm7     Gb
 Till we find our place on the path unwinding yeah
.(slowing) Bb/F F             Eb       Bb    Eb     Bb  
 In the circle, the circle of life</lyrics>

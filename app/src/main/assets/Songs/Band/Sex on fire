  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E (guitar only)  
.C#m (all in)       E  C#m


[V1]
.                 E
 Lay where you're laying, don't make a sound
.               C#m
 I know they're watching, they're watching
.          E
 All the commotion, the kiddie like pain
.           C#m
 Has people talking, talking

[C]
.E                E/G# C#m  A
 You, your sex is on   fire

[V2]
 Dark of the alley, the breaking of day
 Head while I'm driving, I'm driving
 Soft lips are open, them knuckles are pale
 Feels like you're dying, you're dying

[C2]
.E                E/G# C#m  A
 You, your sex is on   fire
.   E                   E/G# C#m A
 Consumed with whats to transpire

[V3]
 Hot as a fever, rattling bones
 I could just taste it, taste it
 But it's not forever, but it's just tonight
 Oh we're still the greatest, the greatest, the greatest

;Chorus x2

[Outro]

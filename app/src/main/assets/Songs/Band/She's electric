.(F#7 x4)
.E  G# C#m A2    E G# C#m A2   E G# C#m A2   C  D  E

[V1]
.E  G#  C#m  A2             E      G#       C#m    A2
 She's electric, she's in a family full of ecentrics
.      E                G#     C#m  A2       C    D    E
 She's done things I've never expected and I need more time

[V2]
 She's got a sister, and God only knows how I've missed her
 And on the palm of her hand is a blister, and I need more time

[C]
.A     Amaj7       A                 Amaj7           
 And I want you to know, I've got my mind made up now
.A     C#m       E    E7 
 But I need more time
.A     Amaj7       A                Amaj7
 And I want you to say, do you know what I'm saying
.A     C#m
 But I need more....
.      E                                     E7
 Cause I'll be you and you'll be me, there's lots and lots for us to see
.        F#m7add4                    B                                  (E)
 There's lots and lots for us to do, she is electric, can I be electric too?

[SOLO]
.E  G# C#m A2      E  G# C#m A2     E  G# C#m A2     C  D  E

[V3]
 She's got a brother, we don't get on with one another
 But I quite fancy her mother, and I think that she likes me
 She's got a cousin, In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
 She's got one in the oven, but it's nothing to do with me

[C2]
 And I want you to know I've got my mind made up now
 But I need more time
 And I want you to say, do you know what I'm saying
 But I need more
 Cause I'll be you and you'll be me, there lots and lots for us to see
 There's lots and lots for us to do
.B                                  C  D  E      C  D  E
 She is electric can I be electric, too          
.                  C  D  E      C  D  E   (repeatâ€¦.... to end)
 Can I be electric too</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.A
;Guitar theme for 3 bars

[V1]
.A           E/G#      D             A
 We'll do it all, everything, on our own
.A        E/G#    D            A
 We don't need anything, or anyone

[C]
.         A               E/G#      
 If I lay here, if I just lay here
.              D                           A
 Would you lie with me and just forget the world

[V2]
 I don't quite know how to say how I feel
 Those three words, I said too much, but not enough

[C2]
 If I lay here, if I just lay here
 Would you lie with me and just forget the world
 Forget what we're told, before we get too old
 Show me a garden that's bursting into life

[V3]
 Let's waste time, chasing cars, around our heads
 I need your grace to remind me to find my own  

;2 bar pause then all in full

[C3]
 If I lay here, if I just lay here
 Would you lie with me and just forget the world
 Forget what we're told, before we get too old
 Show me a garden that's bursting into life
 All that I am, all that I ever was
 Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
 I don't know where, confused about how as well
 Just know that these things will never â€¦..
 ...Change for us at all
 If I lay here, if I just lay here
 Would you lie with me and just forget the world</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.    Am                                           E
 Now I'm the king of the swingers, the jungle V.I.P.
.E7
 I've reached the top an' had to stop
.                            Am
 An' that's what's botherin' me
.  Am                                            E
 I wanna be a man, man-cub an' stroll right into town
.    E7                                                 Am
 An' be like all the other kids, I'm tired of monkeying around

[C]
.Am/B C                          A7
 Oh,  oobee doo, I wanna be like you
.        D7             G7            C C#dim G7
 I wanna walk like you, talk like you too
.                C                 A7
 You'll see it's true, an ape like me
.    D7          G7    C    E7
 Can learn to be human too

[V2]
 Now don't try and kid me man cub don't get me in a stew
 What I desire is man's red fire So I can be like you
 Give me the secret man cub, just tell me what to do
 Give me the power of man's red fire
 And make my dreams come true

[V3]
 I like your mannerisms, we'll be a set of friends
 Then one will know where man will end
 and the orang-utan begins
 And when I eat my bananas, I won't peel them with my feet
 Cause I'll become a man cub and learn some mannering</lyrics></song>

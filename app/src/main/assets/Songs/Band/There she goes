  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G   D   C  x4  (guitar only)

[RIFF]
.G   D   C     G   D   C     G   D   C
.Am  G   C     Am  G   C     D....... 
           
[V1]
.G     D   C     G         D     C 
 There she goes, there she goes again, 
.G      D          C 
 Racing through my brain; 
.    Am     G        C         Am      G      C  D ... 
 And I just can't contain this feeling that remains.               

[V2]
 There she goes, there she goes again, 
 Waltzing through my brain; 
 And I just can't contain this feeling that remains.               
               
;RIFF   (SLOWING DOWN)

.Em        C     Em             C 
 There she goes, there she goes again 
.    D        G     D        C 
 She calls my name, calls my name, 
.G      D          C 
 Racing through my brain 
.    Am     G        C         Am      G      C  D ... 
 And I just can't contain this feeling that remains                             

[V3]
 There she goes, there she goes again, 
 Chasing down my road 
 And I just can't contain this feeling that remains

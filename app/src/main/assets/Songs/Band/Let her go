.C    D Em    D     C    D Em       x2

[C]
.                       C                       G                       
 Well you only need the light when it's burning low
.              D                     Em
 Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
.              C                         G    D
 Only know you love her when you let her go
.                      C                        G
 Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
.              D                        Em
 Only hate the road when youâ€™re missin' home
.              C                         G      D
 Only know you love her when you let her go
 
;ALL IN

.                Em   C    D     Bm     Em     C       D
 And you let her go

[V1]
.Em                            C             D                           Bm
 Staring at the bottom of your glass, hoping one day you'll make a dream last
.                Em                  C      D
 But dreams come slow and they go so fast
.    Em                          C           D                         Bm
 You see her when you close your eyes, maybe one day you'll understand why
.               Em           C     D
 Everything you touch surely dies

;CHORUS

[V2]
 Staring at the ceiling in the dark, same old empty feeling in your heart
 'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast 
 Well you see her when you fall asleep, but never to touch and never to keep
 'Cause you loved her too much, and you dived too deep

;CHORUS

[BREAK
.                Em      C    D
 And you let her go (oh, oh, ooh)
 And you let her go (oh, oh, ooh)
.                 Em   C    D     Bm     Em     C       D
 Well you let her go

;CHORUS  x2   (2nd time guitar only)

.                Em
 And you let her go</lyrics>

  <title>Some guys have all the luck</title>
  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.A    F#m    D    E

[C]
.               A                            F#m
 Some guys have all the luck, some guys have all the pain
.               D                            E
 Some guys have all the breaks, some guys do nothing but complain

[V1]
.A                                            F#m
 Alone in a crowd on a bus after work and I'm dreaming
.    Bm                   G                          E
 The guy next to me has a girl in his arms, mine are empty
.A                                                   F#m
 How does it feel when the girl next to you says she loves you
.Bm            	              G                           E
 Seems so unfair when there's love everywhere but there's none left for me

[C]

[V2]
 Someone to take on a walk by the lake on a long afternoon
 Someone who's shy, someone who cries at sad movies
 I know I would die if I ever found out she was foolin with me
 You're just a dream and as real as it seems I'm not that lucky

[C]

[GUITAR INSTR]
.F#m   E    x4

[V3]
 All of my friends have a ring on their finger, their someone
 Someone to care for them, it's not fair, I've got no one
 The car overheated, I called up and pleaded, there's heaven to pay
 I called you collect, you didn't expect, you had nothing to say
  
[C]

[C2]
 If you were here with me, I'd feel so happy I would cry
 You are so dear to me, I just can't let you say goodbye

[C]

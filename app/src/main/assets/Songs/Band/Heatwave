  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.A  x4 bars  
.(Em  F#m  Bm) x2
.Em  F#m  G  A  D 
 
[V1]
.             Em      F#m            Bm 
 Whenever I'm with him   something inside 
.          Em     F#m                     Bm 
 Starts to burnin'    and I'm filled with desire 
.Em              F#m               G                   A            (D)
 Could it be the devil in me or is this the way love's supposed to be 

[C] 
.            D                       D                      
 Just like a heatwave, burning in my heart, 
.                D                       D 
 Can't keep from cryin' it's tearing me apart 

[V2]
 Whenever he calls my name,     so low,  sweet and plain 
 I feel, like th-a-t,     well I feel that burning flame 
 Hasa high blood pressure got a hold on me 
 Or is this the way love's supposed to be 
 
;CHORUS
;SOLO AS VERSE 

[V3]
 Sometimes I stare into space te-a-rs all over my face 
 I can't explain it, don't understand it, I ain't never felt like this before 
 But that doesn't mean it has me amazed 
 I don't know what to do, my head's in a haze, Just like a Heatwave 
 
;CHORUS

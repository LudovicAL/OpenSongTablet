[V1]
.        A       F#m/A        E     Em
 We have all the time  in the world
.                Bm        E7
 Time enough for life to unfold
.E7               A                  E7
 All the precious things love has in store

[V2]
.        A       F#m/A        E    Em
 We have all the love  in the world
.                 Bm            E7                   A
 If that's all we have you will find we need nothing more

[C]
.      C           Bb       F  F7+ Bb
 Every step of the way will find   us

 With the cares of the world far behind us

[V3]

 We have all the time in the world just for love

 Nothing more, nothing less, only love

 Nothing more, nothing less, only love

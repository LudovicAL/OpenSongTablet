[V1]
.   F         Fmaj7     Dm
 My first, my last, my everything, 
.F       F7        Bb           
 And the answer to all my dreams.
.Gm        C             Am         Dm
 You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star.
.G                     Bbm             C  (STOP)
 My kind of wonderful, that's what you are.
.F              Fmaj7      Dm
 I know there's only, only one like you
.F              F7              Bb              
 There's no way they could have made two.
.Bb                     Bbm         F                       D
 You're, you're all I'm living for, your love I'll keep for evermore.
.           G         C        F     F     F     C
 You're the first, my last, my everything.

[V2]
 In you I've found so many things,
 A love so new, only you could bring.
 Can't you see if you,
 You'll make me feel this way,
 You're like a first morning dew
 On a brand new day.
 I see so many ways that I can love you,
 'Till the day I die....
 You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream.
 You're my first, my last, my everything.

.A    G D

[V1]
.A                                          
 Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner, 
.D                       A
 But he knew it couldn't last
.A                                      
 Jo Jo left his home in Tucson Arizona, 
.D                   A    
 For some California grass

[C]
.    A                   D                        A     G D
 Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
.    A                   D                        A     G D
 Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged

[V2]
.A                                          
 Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman, 
.D                   A
 But she was another man
.A                                      
 All the girls around her say she's got it coming, 
.D                         A    
 But she gets it while she can

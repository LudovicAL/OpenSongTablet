[V1]
.            C                            G 
 I try to discover, a little something to make me sweeter
.          E                       F 
 Oh baby refrain, from breaking my heart
.          C                         G 
 I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
.                    F                       Am 
 That you give me no reason, why you make me work so hard
.G 
 That you give me no, that you give me no
.
 That you give me no, that you give me no 
.C                Am 
 Soul, I hear you calling
.        F                        Em    F G (C)
 Oh baby please, give a little respect, to  me

[V2]
 And if I should falter, would you open your arms out to me
 We could make love not war and live at peace with our hearts
 I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue
 What religion or reason could drive a man to forsake his lover
 Don't you tell me no, don't you tell me no
 Don't you tell me no, don't you tell me no
 Soul, I hear you calling
 Oh baby please, give a little respect, to me

[C]
 I'm so in love with you, I'll be forever blue 
 That you give me no reason, why you make me work so hard
 That you give me no, that you give me no
 That you give me no, that you give me no
 Soul, I hear you calling
 Oh baby please, give a little respect, to me
 I hear you calling
 Oh baby please, give a little respect, to me</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.              D      D7            G
 Your cheating heart, will make you weep
.               A7             D
 You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
.    A7          D        D7          G
 But sleep won't come the whole night through
.              A7                  D
 Your cheating heart, will tell on you

[C]
.     D7         G                 D
 When tears come down like falling rain
.            E7                 A7
 You'll toss around and call my name
.                D      D7        G
 You'll walk the floor, the way I do
.              A7                  D
 Your cheating heart, will tell on you
 
[V2]
.              D      D7            G
 Your cheating heart, will pine someday
.              A7               D
 And crave the love, you threw away
.    A7        D          D7        G
 The time will come, when you'll be blue
.              A7                  D
 Your cheating heart, will tell on you</lyrics></song>

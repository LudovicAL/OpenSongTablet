.  A                          Ab5                   D2/A    A      
 Exactly how you hear it is exactly how it all went down
.       A                             Ab5                              D2/A         A
 It was later in the evening, but the facts and the figures got turned around
.       A                               Ab5            D2/A       A
 It was true there was a woman, yes she did advance my way
.      A                            Ab5                    D2/A       A
 And I can't be sure exactly, but I swear I saw her say my name
.           A                       Ab5                  D2/A              A
 It was the right time, she was the real thing, I had to walk away

.               A            G7                      D9          G7
 Don't wanna be stitched up, out of my mind, feeling strung out, lagging behind
.A           G7                             D9         G7                  
 Trapped in, can't do a thing, because I'm locked down
.A            G7                D9            G7              
 Stitched up, feeling the burn, strung out, I finally learned that
.A               G7                              D9         G7
 Trapped in, you can't do a thing because you're locked down

[V2]
 I wonder where she came from, I wonder where she's gotta go
 Who's to say she's single, who's to say she's on her own
 Girls like that don't sleep alone

 That girl is flawless and I'm know I'm not the first to think that
 Since I'm not the first, I sure won't be the last, 
 Spend my whole life looking behind my back
 I just don't think I'm up to that

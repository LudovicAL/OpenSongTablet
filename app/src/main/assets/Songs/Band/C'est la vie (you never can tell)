.         C
 It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well 
.                                                    G
 You could see that Pierre did truly love the madamoiselle 
.                                                           G7
 And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell 
.                                                                 C
 "C'est la vie", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell 

[V2]
 They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale 
 The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale, 
 But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well  
 "C'est la vie", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell 

[V3]
 They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast 
 Seven hundred little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz 
 But when the sun went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell 
 "C'est la vie", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell 

[V4]
 They bought a souped-up jitney, 'twas a cherry red '53, 
 They drove it down to Orleans to celebrate the anniversary 
 It was there that Pierre was married to the lovely mademoiselle 
 "C'est la vie", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell 

[V5]
 It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well 
 You could see that Pierre did truly love the madamoiselle 
 And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell 
 "C'est la vie", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell</lyrics>

.Bbmaj7   Fmaj7   Bbmaj7   Fmaj7

[V1]
.Gm            
 Didn't know what time it was, the light were low,
.F
 I leaned back on my radio
.C                             C7                       F  Ab  Bb
 Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll lotta soul he said
.Gm      
 Then the loud sound did seem to fade,
.F
 Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
.C                             C7          A    G6
 That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive

[C]
.          F       Dm      
 There's a starman waiting in the sky, 
.     Am               Am/G           C
 He'd like to come and meet us but he thinks he'd blow our minds
.           F      Dm
 There's a starman waiting in the sky
.   Am             Am/G             C                   C7
 He told us not to blow it cause he knows it's all worthwhile
.             Bb      Bbm               F       D7
 He told me â€“ let the children lose it, let the children use it
.Gm      C7              Bb  F   C   F         Bb   F    C
 Let the children boogie

[V2]
 I had to phone someone so I picked on you, hey
 That's far out so you heard him too!
 Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
 Look out your window I can see his light
 If we can sparkle he may land tonight
 Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

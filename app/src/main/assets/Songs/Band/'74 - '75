  <lyrics>[V1]
.D          A          D                   A     A/G#    F#m              A           E
 You got no reason for coming to me in the rain, running down, there's no reason      
.D       A          D                   A        A/G#    F#m         A            E
 And the same voice coming to me like a it's all slowing down, and believe me     

[C]
.          F#m            A
 I was the one to let you know
.          E          D       F#m   A      E
 I was you sorry ever after '74 - '75      

[V2]
.D        A     D                      A  A/G# F#m              A         E
 It's not easy, nothing is sacred it's already said, it's never easy      
.       D            A         D              A     A/G#   F#m          A                 E
 When I look on your eyes then finally I'll define, when I look on your eyes then I'll be better

[C]
 I was the one to let you know
 I was you sorry ever after '74 - '75
 Give me reward and I'll define
 'Cause you're really only after '74 - '75

[V3]
 You got no reason for coming to me in the dark, running down, there's no reason.
 When I look on your eyes then finally I'll define, when I look on your eyes then I'll be better

[C]
 I was the one to let you know
 I was you sorry ever after '74 - '75
 Give me reward and I'll define
 'Cause you're really only after '74 - '75</lyrics>

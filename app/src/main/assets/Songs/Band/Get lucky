  <title>Get lucky</title>
  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Am    C    Em   D   x2     (same chords throughout)

[V1]
 Like the legend of the phoenix, all ends with beginnings
 What keeps the planet spinning (uh),
 The force of love beginning
 We've come too far to give up who we are
 So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

[C]
 She's up all night 'til the sun,  
 I'm up all night to get some
 She's up all night for good fun, 
 I'm up all night to get lucky
 
 We're up all night 'til the sun, 
 We're up all night to get some
 We're up all night for good fun, 
 We're up all night to get lucky

 We're up all night to get lucky, 
 We're up all night to get lucky
 We're up all night to get lucky, 
 We're up all night to get lucky

[V2]
 The present has no ribbon, your gift keeps on giving,
 What is this I'm feeling?, if you wanna leave I'm ready (ah)
 We've come too far to give up who we are
 So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

[C]

[B]
 We've come too far to give up who we are
 So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

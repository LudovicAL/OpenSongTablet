  <title>Make you feel my love</title>
  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Bb   F/A   Ab    Eb   Ebm   Bb    C7   Ebm    Bb

[V1]
.Bb                       F/A
 When the rain is blowing in your face
.Ab                     Eb
 And the whole world is on your case
.Ebm                Bb            C7          Ebm     Bb
 I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love

[V2]
 When the evening shadows and the stars appear
 And there is no one there to dry your tears
 I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love

[C]
.Eb                           Bb
 I know you haven't made your mind up yet
.D7          Eb           Bb
 But I would never do you wrong
.Eb                            Bb
 I've known it from the moment that we met
.C7                              F/A
 No doubt in my mind where you belong

[V3]
 I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
 I'd go crawling down the avenue
 No there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love

[INSTRUMENTAL]
.Bb  F/A  Ab   Eb   Ebm   Bb   C7   Ebm   Bb

[C2]
 The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
 And on the highway up ahead
 The winds of change are blowin' over me
 You ain't seen nothin' like me yet

[V4]
 I could make you happy make your dreams come true
 Nothin' that I wouldn't do
 Go to the ends of the earth for you
 To make you feel my love

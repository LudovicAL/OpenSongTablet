.G  C7 D7 C7  - 12 bar blues

[V1]
 Well, shake it up, baby, now, Twist and shout. 
 Cmon cmon, cmon, cmon, baby, now,  
 Come on and work it on out. 
 Well, work it on out now, honey, You know you look so good. 
 You know you got me goin, now,  
 Just like I knew you would.

[V2]
 Well, shake it up, baby, now,  Twist and shout. 
 Cmon, cmon, cmon, cmon, baby, now,  
 Come on and work it on out. 
 You know you twist your little girl, You know you twist so fine. 
 Come on and twist a little closer, now,  
 And let me know that you’re mine.

 Well, shake it up, baby, now,  Twist and shout. 
 Cmon, cmon, cmon, cmon, baby, now,  
 Come on and work it on out. 
 You know you twist your little girl, You know you twist so fine.  
 Come on and twist a little closer, now, 
 And let me know that you’re mine.

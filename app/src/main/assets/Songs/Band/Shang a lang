[V1]
.G
 We were rippin up, we were rockin up, roll it over and lay it down
 We were shakin up , we were breakin up, 
.                      G7                        C
 We were rockin to the shang-a-lang sound of the music
.                       G
 HEY HEY, rockin to the music. 
.                        A7                             D7 
 HEY HEY, rocking to the music, rocking every night and day. HEY

[C]
.        G                       C
 Well we sang shang-a-lang as we ran with the gang 
.     G                   D7
 Doin doo wop be dooby do ay
.        G                        C
 We were all in the news with our blue suede shoes 
.        G          F      G    D7
 And our dancin the night away.
.       G                       C
 And we sang shang-a-lang as we ran with the gang
.     G                   D7
 Doin doo wop be dooby do eye
.         G                   C
 With the jukebox playing and every body saying that
.G          F            (G   F#  F   F#  G ) x2
 Music like ours couldn't die

[V2]
 We were grooving, we were movin, pussyfootin and booting it round.
 We were boppin it, we were hoppin it
 We were jumping to the shang-a-lang sound of the music,....

 Oh I need you tonight, need ya, need ya tonight, Yeah I need ya tonight, need ya, need ya tonight

[V1]
.     Fm                                       Fm/C        Bb      Bb/C
 Oh I tell myself that I can be a stronger man than I know I can be
.        Fm                                           Fm/C    Bb       
 I can't help but feel the burden of my weakness when you're away from me
.Bb/C    Fm Fm/G Fm/Ab    Fm/C    Bb
 Falling down, it's easy, falling down
.     Fm                                            Fm/C    Bb
 Oh I know I've got to carry on but it's so hard to wait so long for you

[C]
.             Ab  Eb                Cm                  Bb

.              Ab Eb             Cm                       Bb
 I try to hold on.  I kill every second since you've been gone, oh
.    Ab                      Eb                         Cm                    Bb
 I'm stuck here in darkness, hole where my heart is, without you I can't make it right
.               Ab   Eb        Bb
 And I need you tonight, yes I do

[V2]
 Well I'm staring at the bottom of another glass I'm feeling empty now
 I close my eyes and think of you, its all that I can do to fill the space somehow
 Calling out, can you hear me, calling out to you?
 I'm cold I'm shaking, baby come and take me from this hell that I've been living through

;Chorus

[Break (first two lines of verse)]
.     Ab                             Eb                  Bb
 Oh I need you tonight, need ya, need ya tonight, Yeah I need ya tonight, need ya, need ya tonight
.     Ab                             Eb                  Bb
 Oh I need you tonight, need ya, need ya tonight, Yeah I need ya tonight, need ya, need ya tonight
.Fm      Fm/C        Bb      Bb/C     (Fm)
Ohhhhhhhhh,  Woowooowoo,      Ahhhhhh

[V3]
Every time I think about it, Oh yeah I cry some more
Every time I think about it, Yeah baby I cry some more, Cry cry some more
Every time I think about it, baby I cry some more, cry some more
Every time I think about it, I cry some more

[Chorus (slow)]
 I need you tonight, I need you to come on and save my life
 I try to hold on, I kill every second since you've been gone
[Chorus (full)]
 I need you tonight, I need you to come on and save my life
 I try to hold on, I kill every second since you've been gone
 Now I'm stuck here in darkness, hole where my heart is
 Without you I can't make it right
 I need you tonight, yes I do

[B]
 Oh I need you tonight, need ya, need ya tonight, yeah I need ya tonight, need ya, need ya tonight
 Oh I need you tonight, need ya, need ya tonight, yeah I need ya tonight yeaahhh

[Chorus]

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.D C       G                         D C     G
 Ah oooooh, Werewolves of London.... Ah oooh x2

[V1]
.       D              C                      G         
 It was ninteen eighty nine, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
.D                C                 G 
 Caught somewhere between a boy and man
.D            C                G
 She was seventeen and she was far from in between
.       D             C         G
 It was summertime in Northern Michigan
.D  C  G  D  C  G
 Aaaaaah, aaaaaah
 
[V2]
 Splashing through the sand bar, talking by the campfire
 It's the simple things in life like when and where
 We didn't have no internet, but man I never will forget
 The way the moonlight shined upon her hair
 
[C]
 And we were trying different things, we were smoking funny things
 Making love out by the lake to our favourite song
 Sipping whisky out the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow
 Singing sweet home Alabama all summer long
 Singing sweet home Alabama all summer long
 
[V3]
 Catching walleye from the dock, watching waves roll off the rocks
 She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
 We'd blister in the sun, we couldn't wait for night to come
 To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

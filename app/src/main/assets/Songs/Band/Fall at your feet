  <title>Fall at your feet</title>
  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Cm  Dm7  Cm  Dm7/G     x3 

[V1]
.                 Cm      Eb                    Dm7              G 
 I'm really close tonight,  and I feel like I'm moving inside her 
.             Cm  Eb                 Dm7          G 
 Lying in the dark  I think that I'm beginning to know her
.       Cm  Eb                        Ab 
 Let it go,    I'll be there when you call 

[C]
.               Eb   Bb/D    Cm   Ab 
 And whenever I fall at your feet 
.                 Eb    Bb/D         Cm  Ab 
 And you let your tears rain down on me 
.           Eb         Bb/D         Cm   Ab 
 Whenever I touch your slow turning pain 

[V2]
 Your hiding from me now there's something in the way that you're talking 
 The words don't sound right but I hear them all moving inside you 
 Go  I'll be waiting when you call 

;CHORUS

[T]
.              Eb               Bb           
 The finger of blame has turned upon itself 
.        Cm                   Ab 
 And I'm more than willing to offer myself 
.       Eb                  Bb 
 Do you want my presence or need my help 
.Cm                         Ab       (Eb)
 Who knows where that might lead.  I fall  â€¦.

[Instrumental]
.Eb    Bb   Cm   Ab/Eb   Bb   Bb/D   Cm   Ab                     

;CHORUS x2

[Outro]
.           Eb Bb            Cm   Ab     (Eb) 
 Whenever I fall, whenever I fall...........         REPEAT</lyrics>

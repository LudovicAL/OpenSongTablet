.E    Esus4   E   Esus4 

[V1]
.E          A                  E          A
 I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
.E            A         B 
 Against your skin so brown
.E           A                     E        A    
 And I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight
.E              A          B 
 With a million stars all around

[C]
.            A             E
 And I got a peaceful easy feeling
.F#m                        A   B 
 And I know it won't let me down
.           E F#m   A      B        (E Esus4 E Esus4)
 'Cause I'm already standing on the ground

[V2]
 And I found out a long time ago
 What a woman can do to your soul
 Ah, but she can't take you anyway
 You don't already know how to go

[C]

[GUITAR INSTRUMENTAL (As Verse + Chorus)]

[V3]
 I get this feeling I may know you
 As a lover and a friend
 But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear
 Tells me I may never see you again

[C]

[OUTRO]
.        E F#m   A      B.....        
 Yes I'm already standing .... (on the ground...ooooh)</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Am   Bb   Am   Bb  F  Am   Bb   Bb ....... 
.C      F Bb F  C      F Bb F 
 Oooh, oooh     Oooh, oooh    x2 

[V1]
.C         Bb/C                  C 
 Debonair, lullaby in melodies revealed 
.   C               Bb/C                                 C 
 In deep despair on lonely nights, he knows just how you feel 
.    C                  Bb/C                             C 
 The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits, in miracles made real 
.       Am                   Bb 
 Like a bird in flight, on a hot sweet night 
.    Am                        Bb       F  
 You know you're right just to hold her tight 
.   Am                       Bb    
 He sings it right, makes it out of sight 
.   (Bb) 
 And everything's good in the world, tonight 

[C]
.     C      F  Bb F        C    F  Bb F (etc) 
 When Smokey sings   I hear violins
 When Smokey sings   I forget everything 
 As she's packing her things, as she's spreading her wings 
 The front door might slam, but the back door it rings 
 And Smokey sings    He sings 

[V2]
 Elegance and eloquence, for sale or rent or hire 
 Should I say yes, I match his best, then I would be a liar 
 Symphonies that soothe the rage when lovers heart's catch fire 
 Like a bird in flight, on a hot sweet night 
 You know you're right just to hold her tight 
 He sings it right, makes it out of sight 
 And everything's good in the world, tonight 

[C2]
 When Smokey sings   I hear violins 
 When Smokey sings   I forget everything 
 As she's packing her things, as she's spreading her wings 
 Smashin the hell with the heaven she brings 
 And Smokey sings    He sings

[Mid 8]
.            C              Bb/C                               C 
 Would it be true to say, I need you so bad, I need you so bad tonight    x2

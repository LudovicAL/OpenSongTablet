  <lyrics>[V1]
.   G          Em           Am7        D
 By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes,
.          G   D/F#   Em             C  G/B
 Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond
.      C         Em             Am7          D
 Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae,
.       G       Em     C     G/B     D  G
 On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond.

[C]
.  G              Em            Am7           D
 O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak' the low road,
.    G    D/F#  Em        C    G/B
 And I'll be in Scotland afore ye.
.    C         Em             Am7         D               
 But me and my true love will never meet again,
.       G       Em     C     G/B     D  G
 On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond.

[V2]
 'Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen,
 On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomond. 
 Where in deep purple hue, the hieland hills we view, 
 And the moon comin' out in the gloamin'.

[V3]
 The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring,
 And in sunshine the waters are sleeping:
 But the broken heart, it kens nae second spring again,
 Tho' the waefu' may cease from their greeting.</lyrics>

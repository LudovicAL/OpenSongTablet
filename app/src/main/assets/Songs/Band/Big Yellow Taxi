.G (bass)

[V1]
.     G                                   D
 They paved paradise and put up a parkin' lot
.       G             C                        G
 With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot
.G               G7
 Don't it always seem to go
.         C                   Am
 That you don't know what you got till it's gone
.     C                  D                G
 They paved paradise and put up a parkin' lot

[V2]
 They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum
 And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them
 No, no, no, don't it always seem to go
 That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
 They paved paradise, and put up a parkin' lot

[V3]
 Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT
 I don't care about spots on my apples,
 Leave me the birds and the bees - please
 Don't it always seem to go
 That you don't know what you got till it's gone
 They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
 Hey now, they've paved paradise to put up a parking lot
 Why not?

[Instrumental]

[V4]
 Listen, late last night, I heard the screen door swing,
 And a big yellow taxi took my girl away
 Now don't it always seem to go
 That you don't know what you got till it's gone
 They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
 Hey now now, don't it always seem to go
 That you don't know what you got till it's gone
 They paved paradise to put up a parking lot
 Why not, they paved paradise
 They put up a parking lot
 Hey hey hey, paved paradise and put up a parking lot

 I don't wanna give it
 Why you wanna give it
 Why you wanna givin it all away
 Hey, hey, hey
 Now you wanna give it
 I should wanna give it
 Cuz you're givin it all away, no no

 I don't wanna give it
 Why you wanna give it
 Why you wanna givin it all away
 Cuz you're givin it all givin it all away yeah yeah
 Cuz You're givin it all away hey, hey, hey

 Hey, paved paradise, to put up a parking lot
 La,la, la, la, la, la, la ,la ,la ,la ,la
 Paved paradise, and put up a parking lot

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E   A/E   E   A/E   E   A/E   E   B   B/F#   B

[V1]
.                 A/E  E                            A/E   E
 When I look into your eyes, it's like watching the night sky
.               A/E  E                        Bsus4  B
 Or a beautiful sunrise, there's so much they hold
.                   A/E E                        A/E     E
 And just like them old stars, I see that you've come so far
.                  A/E  E                   Bsus4  B
 To be right where you are, how old is your soul?

[C]
.             A     E               C#m       B
 I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough
.               A      E                       Bsus4  B
 I'm giving you all my love, I'm still looking up

[V2]
 And when you're needing your space to do some navigating
 I'll be here patiently waiting to see what you find

[Mid8]
.        F#m
 I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
.                                              B
 I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
.    F#m
 Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
.                                          B
 The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake
.           D
 And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
 For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
.D#dim                           
 We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
.D                            D#dim                      E
 I had to learn what I've got and what I'm not and who I am

[C2]
.             A     E               C#m       B
 I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough
.               A      E                       Bsus4  B
 I'm giving you all my love, I'm still looking up
.             A     E                 C#m    B
 I won't give up on us, God knows I'm tough enough
.            A      E                     Bsus4  B
 We've got a lot to learn, God knows we're worth it
.             A     E              C#m       B
 I won't give up on us, even if he skies get rough
.               A      E                       B
 I'm giving you all my love, I'm still looking up</lyrics>

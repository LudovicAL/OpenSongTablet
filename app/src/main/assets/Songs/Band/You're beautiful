.C  G/B  Am  F2 x2

[V1]
.C                     G/B             Am               F2
 My life is brilliant. My love is pure, I saw an angel, of that I'm sure.
.    C                                   G/B
 She smiled at me on the subway, she was with another man.
.     Am
 But I won't lose no sleep on that, 'cause I've got a plan.

[C]
.F2           G    C                 F2           G         C
 You're beautiful. You're beautiful. You're beautiful, it's true.
.  F2      G         C  G/B  Am           F2    G            Am
 I saw you face in a crowded place, And I don't know what to do,
.            F2    G       C  (as intro)
 'Cause I'll never be with you.

[V2]
 Yeah, she caught my eye, As we walked on by.
 She could see from my face that I was flying high,
 And I don't think that I'll see her again,
 But we shared a moment that will last till the end.

[C]
[B]
.F2    Am     F2    Am
 La la la la, la la la la
.F2    Am     F2    Am    Dm  G
 La la la la, la la la la la

[C2]
 You're beautiful. You're beautiful. You're beautiful, it's true.
 There must be an angel with a smile on her face,
 When she thought up that I should be with you.
 But it's time to face the truth, I will never be with you.</lyrics>

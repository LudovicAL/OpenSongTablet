  <lyrics>[V1]
.            Am7        Bm7        Am7        Bm7      
 Well it's a marvelous night for a moondance,
.         Am7      Bm7           Am7  Bm7
 With the stars up above in your eyes
.  Am7         Bm7           Am7      Bm7
 A fantabulous night to make romance, 
.           Am7      Bm7     Am7   Bm7
 'Neath the cover of October skies
.            Am7           Bm7       Am7      Bm7    
 And all the leaves on the trees are falling,
.       Am7          Bm7     Am7   Bm7
 To the sound of the breezes that blow
.        Am7       Bm7           Am7    Bm7
 And I'm trying to please to the calling
.        Am7                Bm7           Am7
 Of your heart-strings that play soft and low
 
[P]
.             Dm7     Am7            Dm7         Am7
 You know the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
.            Dm7  Am7                Dm7b5         Ealt
 And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush
 
[C]
.   Am7     Dm7        Am7      Dm7         Am7  Dm7 Am7  Dm7
 Can I just have one a-more moondance, with you, my love
.   Am7     Dm7       Am7    Dm7         Am7  Dm7  Am7  Ealt
 Can I just make some more romance, with a-you, my love
 
[V2]
 Well I wanna make love to you tonight, 
 I can't wait 'til the morning has come
 And I know now the time is just right,
 And straight into my arms you will run
 And when you come my heart will be waiting,
 To make sure that you're never alone
 There and then all my dreams will come true dear,
 There and then I will make you my own
 
[P]
 And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
 And I know how much you want me, that you can't hide
 
[C]

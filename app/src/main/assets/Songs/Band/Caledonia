  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E    B  E      E    B  E 
.F#m G#m A   A

[V1]
.E               F#m        
 I don't know if you can see, 
.    G#m                    A
 The changes that have come over me
.         E                   F#m
 In these last few days, I've been afraid
.     G#m             A   A
 That I  might drift away
.              E                    F#m
 And I've been tellin' old stories, singing songs,
.     G#m                 A
 That made me think about where I came from
.E                 F#m           G#m        A   A
 That's the reason why I seem so far away today

[C]
.E                      B
 Let me tell you that I love you
.      E                       A
 And I think about you all the time
.A                 E/G#
 Caledonia, you're callin' me
.            B     E
 And now I'm going home
.    E                    B
 But if I should become a stranger,
.          E                          A
 Know that it would make me more than sad
.A                      B              (E)
 Calendonia's been everything I've ever had

[Break]
.E        B  E     E        B  E    F#m  G#m  A  A

[V2]
 We'll I've been moved, and I've kept on moving,
 Proved the points that needed provin'
 Lost the friends I needed losing, 
 Found others on the way
 I have kissed the ladies and left them crying',
 Stolen dreams there's no denying
 I've travelled hard with conscience flyin',
 Somewhere with the wind

[V3]
 Now I'm sitting here, before the fire,
 The empty room, the forest choir
 Flames that couldn't get any higher,
 They've withered now they've gone
 But I'm steady thinking my way is clear,
 And I know what I'll do tomorrow
 When the hands have shaken and the kisses flow,
 I will disappear</lyrics>

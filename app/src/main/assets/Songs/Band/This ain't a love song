  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.C      G/B      Am     G  x2

[V1]
.C
 Every night I remember that evening
.G
 The way you looked when you said you were leaving
.Am                                       G
 The way you cried as you turned to walk away
 The cruel words and the false accusations
 The mean looks and the same old frustrations
 I never thought that we'd throw it all away, but we threw it all away.

[C]
.F         Am              G
 And I'm a little bit lost without you and I'm a really big mess inside
.F         Am              G
 And I'm a little bit lost without you
.                                    F      Am   G
 This ain't a love song, this is goodbye (ooooooooh)
.                                    F      Am   G
 This ain't a love song, this is goodbye (ooooooooh)

[V2]
 I've been lost, I've been out, I've been losing, 
 I've been tired, I'm all hurt and confusion
 I've been mad, I'm the kind of man that I'm not
 And though I'm down, I'll be coming back fighting
 I may be scared and a little bit frightened
 But I'll be back, I'll be coming back to life, I'll be coming back to life

 And you can try (you can try), and you can try 
.           C             F
 But you'll never keep me down
.F           C                  G                                   
 And you can try (you can try), and you can try 
.           C             F
 But you'll never keep me down

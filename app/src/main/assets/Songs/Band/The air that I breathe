  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bb                        D7 
 If I could make a wish, I think I'd pass 
.Eb             Ebm        Bb 
 Can't think of anything I need 
.Bb                          D7 
 No cigarettes, no sleep, no light, no sound 
.Eb         Ebm              Bb 
 Nothing to eat, no books to read 

[Mid 8]
.Dm 
 Making love with you 
.            Ebm                Bb 
 Has left me peaceful, warm and tired 
.Dm 
 What more can I ask 
.                Ebm          Bb 
 There's nothing left to be desired 

[V2]
.Bb                        D7 
 Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak 
.   Eb           Ebm         Bb 
 So sleep silent angel go to sleep 

[C]
.Bb                           F 
 Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe 
.        Bb 
 Then to love you 
.Bb                F 
 All I need is the air that I breathe 
.        Bb 
 Then to love you 
.Bb                       F   
 All I need is the air that I breathe

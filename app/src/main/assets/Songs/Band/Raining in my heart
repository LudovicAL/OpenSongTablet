.G   G+ x2

[V1]
.    G               G+
 The sun is out, the sky is blue
.        G6             G7
 There's not a cloud to spoil the view
.         C        D7            G    (Am7   D)
 But it's raining, raining in my heart

[V2]
.    G               G+
 The weatherman says fine today
.   G6                  G7
 He doesn't know you've gone away
.         C        D7            G  C  G  G7
 And it's raining, raining in my heart
 
[MID 8]
.Dm7     G7      C
 Oh, misery, misery
.Em           A7  D7    Am7 D
 What's gonna become of me?

[V3]
.  G               G+
 I tell myself, my blues won't show
.    G6             G7
 But I know soon my tears will flow
.        C        D7            G
 Come on raining, raining in my heart

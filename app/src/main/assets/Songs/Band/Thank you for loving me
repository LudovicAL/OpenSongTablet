.D/F#    G     Bm    A  x2

[V1]
.     G                               D
 It's hard for me to say the things I want to say sometimes
.        G                                   D
 There's no one here but you and me and that broken old street light
.A/C#     Bm           G                  A    G
 Lock the doors, we'll leave the world outside    
.D/F#            G               A
 All I've got to give to you are these five words when I....

[C]
.      D              G                A         D
 Thank you for loving me, for being my eyes when I couldn't see
.      A/C#     Bm  Bm/A               E/G#   A
 For parting my lips,  when I couldn't breathe        
.      D/F#    G      A         D/F#     G      A
 Thank you for loving me, thank you for loving me      

[V2]
.  G                           D
 I never knew I had a dream, until that dream was you
.G                               D
 When I look into your eyes, the sky's a different blue
.A/C#     Bm     G            A     G
 Cross my heart, I wear no disguise 
.D/F#              G                 A
 If I tried, you'd make believe that you believed my lies

;REPEAT CHORUS only first half of last line

[B]
.G                                A
 You pick me up when I fall down, you ring the bell before they count me out
.Em                          D/F#
 If I was drowning you would part the sea
.C                                    G      A
 And risk your own life to rescue me, yeah, yeah, yeah ....

.D      G      A      D
.A/C#     Bm          G                   A  G
 Lock the door, we'll leave the world outside     
.D/F#            G               C                     A
 All I've got to give to you are these five words when I          

;REPEAT CHORUS
.      D              G                   A        D
 Thank you for loving me, when I couldn't fly, Oh, you gave me wings
.    A         Bm    Bm/A            E/G#   A
 You parted my lips, when I couldn't breathe        
.      D/F#    G      A         D/F#    G      A
 Thank you for loving me, thank you for loving me
.      D/F#    G      A              D
 Thank you for loving me, for loving me

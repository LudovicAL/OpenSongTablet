.Fm Db Bbm Fm x2
[V1]
.Fm              Db              Bbm               Fm
 Don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head,
.Fm           Db                  Bbm             Fm
 Dredging the Great White Sharks, swimming in the bed,
.Fm               Db               Bbm        Fm
 And here comes a Killer Whale, to sing me to sleep,
.Fm            Db                 Bbm        Fm
 Thrashing the covers off, it has me by it's teeth.
[C]
.    Ab    Bbm           Fm                   Db
 And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
.Ab                        Bbm             Fm            Db
 I can't help but pull the earth around me,   to make my bed
.    Ab    Bbm           Fm                   Db
 And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
.      Ab                   Bbm                 Fm                 Db
 Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch? Did I build this ship to wreck?
.   Fm    Db   Bbm   Fm    Fm   Db       Bbm                Fm
 To wreck,  to wreck,   to wreck,  Did I build this ship to wreck?
[V2]
.Fm              Db        Bbm            Fm
 What's with the long face?   Do you want more?
.Fm           Db             Bbm               Fm
 Thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door,
.Fm            Db                 Bbm                      Fm
 Don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before,
.Fm              Db              Bbm                 Fm
 The chair is an island darling, you can't touch the floor,
[C]
.    Ab    Bbm           Fm                   Db
 And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
.Ab                        Bbm             Fm            Db
 I can't help but pull the earth around me,   to make my bed
.    Ab    Bbm           Fm                   Db
 And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
.      Ab                   Bbm                 Fm                 Db
 Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch? Did I build this ship to wreck?
.   Fm    Db   Bbm   Fm    Fm   Db       Bbm                Fm
 To wreck,  to wreck,   to wreck,  Did I build this ship to wreck?

 Whoa ho a, Whoa ho a,  Whoa ho a
[Mid 8]

 And good God, under starry skies we are lost, And into the breach we got tossed,
.        Eb                Fm
 And the water's coming in fast!
[C]
.    Ab    Bbm           Fm                   Db
 And oh my love remind me, what was it that I said?
.Ab                        Bbm             Fm            Db
 I can't help but pull the earth around me,   to make my bed
.    Ab    Bbm           Fm                   Db
 And oh my love remind me, what was it that I did?
.      Ab                   Bbm                 Fm                 Db
 Did I drink too much? Am I losing touch? Did I build this ship to wreck?
.   Fm    Db   Bbm   Fm    Fm   Db       Bbm                Fm
 To wreck,  to wreck,   to wreck,  Did I build this ship to wreck?

 To wreck,  to wreck,   to wreck,  Did I build this ship to wreck?

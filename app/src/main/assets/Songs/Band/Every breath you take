[V1]
.                 Aadd9                    F#madd9 
 Every breath you take, and every move you make, 
.               Dadd9                 Eadd9 
 Every bond you break, every step you take,

 I'll be watching you. 

[V2]
.             Aadd9                   F#madd9 
 Every single day, and every word you say, 
.               Dadd9                 Eadd9 
 Every game you play, every night you stay,

 Oh can't you see,   you belong to me 
.                  B9                         E11 
 How my poor heart aches, with every step you take.

.               Aadd9                   F#madd9 
 Every move you make, and every vow you break, 
.                Dadd9                 Eadd9 
 Every smile you fake, every claim you stake,

 I'll be watching you. 

[Mid 8]
.F                                           G 
 Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace, 
.                                      F 
 I dream at night, I can only see your face, 
.                                     G 
 I look around, but its you I can't replace, 
.                                      F 
 I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace 
.                          (Aadd9) 
 I keep crying, baby, baby, please.

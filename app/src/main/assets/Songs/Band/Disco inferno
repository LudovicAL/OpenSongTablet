  <lyrics>[INTRO]
;BASS RIFF FIRST
.Cm       Eb F Cm           Bb F Cm
.Cm       Eb F Cm           Bb F Cm 
. F               Bb     C
 (Burn baby burn) ….....(Burn baby burn) ….....

[V1]
.Cm      Eb F       Cm              Bb F Cm
 To mass fires, one hundred storeys high
.Cm                   Eb F         Cm          Bb F Cm
 People getting loose now, getting down on the roof
.Cm                   Eb F Cm        Bb F Cm
 The folks were screaming, out of control
.       Cm         Eb F          Cm                  Eb F Cm
 It was so entertaining when the boogie started to explode
.            C
 I heard somebody say
 
[C]
. F               Bb
 (Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
. C
 (Burn baby burn) Burn that mother down
. F               Bb
 (Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
. C
 (Burn baby burn) Burn that mother down

[V2] 
 Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
 I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct
 The heat was on, rising to the top
 Everybody going strong, and that is when my spark got hot
 I heard somebody say
 
;Chorus

[Mid 8]
. Bb                      C
 (Up above my head I hear music in the air)  I hear music
.Bb                           C                  (riff with pushes)
 That makes me know there's a party somewhere.....
 
;Verse 2

;Chorus x2

[Outro]
.Cm       Eb F Cm           Bb F Cm

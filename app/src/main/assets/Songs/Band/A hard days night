.F6

[V1]
.            G    C     G                    F6             G
 It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
.            G    C     G                  F6              G
 It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
.           C                           D7          
 But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do
.             G    C  G
 Will make me feel alright

[V2]
 You know I work all day, to get you money to buy you things
 And it's worth it just to hear you say, you're gonna give me everything           
 So why I love to come home, cos when I get you alone
 You know I'll be okay

[Mid 8]
.         Bm    Em                       Bm
 When I'm home, everything seems to be alright
.         G     Em                     F      D
 When I'm home, feeling you holding me tight, tight...

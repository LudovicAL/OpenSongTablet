.F               C/E                     Dm                   C
 There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard
.Bb           F/A              Gm7           C
 No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart,
.F   C/E                  Dm          C
 Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
.       Bb          F/A              Gm7         C
 Like a shoe box of photographs with sepia-toned loving
.F             C/E                Dm                        C
 Love is the answer at least for most of the questions in my heart, like
.Bb         F/A                   Gm7                    C
 Why are we here? And where do we go?  And how come it's so hard?
.F               C/E                Dm            C
 It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
.Bb            F/A                    Gm7                 C
 I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together

[C]
.Bb                C
 Mmmm, it's always better when we're together
.Bb                      C
 Yeah we'll look at them stars and we're together
.Bb                C
 Well, it's always better when we're together
.Bb               C
 Yeah it's always better when we're together

[Break]
.F   C/E   Dm   C    Bb    F/A    Gm7   C    x2

[V2]
 And all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight,
 But I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings
 And brings new things for tomorrow night you see
 That they'll be gone too, too many things I have to do
 But if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
 I'd be under the impression I was somewhere in between
 With only two, just me and you, not so many things we got to do
 Or places we got to be, we'll sit beneath the mango tree, now,

;CHORUS

[Mid8]
.Gm                 C                Gm                  C
 I believe in memories they look so, so pretty when I sleep
.         Gm               C              Gm                       C
 Hey now, and when I wake up, you look so pretty sleeping next to me
.             Gm             C              Bb               C
 But there is not enough time, There is no, no song I could sing
.               Bb                C
 and there is no combination of words I could say 
.              Bb                  C
 But I will still tell you one thing

 We're Better together

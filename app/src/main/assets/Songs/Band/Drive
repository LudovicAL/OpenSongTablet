[V1]
.C                    Cmaj7     C        Cmaj7 
 Who's gonna tell you when it's too late? 
.C                    Cmaj7         C        Cmaj7 
 Who's gonna tell you things aren't so great? 
.Am           D            Am        D 
 You can't go on thinking, nothing's wrong 
.C                     G      C     Cmaj7 
 Who's gonna drive you home tonight? 

[V2]
 Who's gonna pick you up when you fall?
 Who's gonna hang it up when you call?
 Who's gonna pay attention to your dreams?
 Who's gonna plug their ears when you scream?
 You can't go on thinking, nothing's wrong
 Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

 Who's gonna hold you down when you shake? 
.C                Cmaj7       C         Cmaj7
 Who's gonna come around when you break?
.Am           D            Am        D
 You can't go on thinking, nothing's wrong
.C                     G      C
 Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

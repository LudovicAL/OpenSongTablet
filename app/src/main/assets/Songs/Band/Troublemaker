  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.F      E  Am  (repeat)
 	
[V1]
.Am                               F              E
 You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down
.Am                               F              E
 The way you bite your lip got my head spinnin' around
.Am                         F             E
 After a drink or two I was putty in your hands
.  F                                    F   E
 I don't know if I have the strength to stand, oh oh oh....

[C]
.Am                                F           E
 Trouble troublemaker, yeah that's your middle name
.Am                               F           E
 I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain
.Am          Dm               G       C
 Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad, oh oh oh...
.Am            Dm            G           C
 My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can
.Am        Dm                G       C
 I say I'm done but then you pull me back, oh oh oh...
.Am             Dm          G      C                   (Am)
 I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker!

[V2]
 It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind
 I see a silhouette every time I close my eyes
 There must be poison in those finger tips of yours
 Cause I keep comin' back again for more, oh oh oh.....

[C]

[V3]
 You're so dangerous, yes you've got me in your clutch
 So ridiculous, seems like I can't get enough
 Caught up in your web, how'd I get in such a mess?
 Tied up to your bed-bed-bed-bed-bed...

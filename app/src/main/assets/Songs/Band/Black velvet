  <lyrics>[V1]
.Ebm 
 Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell, 
 Jimmy rogers on the victrola up high 
 Mama's dancing with baby on her shoulder, 
 The sun is setting like molasses in the sky 
.Bbsus4        Bb    Absus4            Ab 
 The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything 
.Gbsus4 Gb            Dbsus4         Db 
 Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for 
 
[C]
.Abm                   Dbsus4     Db     
 Black velvet and that little boy smile, 
.Abm                    E             B 
 Black velvet with that slow southern style 
.Abm                    Dbsus4                  
 A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
.Db    B7     Bb7    Ebm
 Black velvet if you please 
 
[V2]
 Up in memphis the music's like a heat wave,
 White lightning, bound to drive you wild 
 Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl, 
 "Love me tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle 
 The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true 
 Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for 
 
;CHORUS     (2 bar pause at end)
 
[Mid8]
.Abm                 Bbm                       Ebm 
 Every word of every song that he sang was for you 
.Abm               E                    B7  Bb7 (1x bar pause) 
 In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon,  
.                Ebm   (for 8 bar guitar solo)
 What could you do?

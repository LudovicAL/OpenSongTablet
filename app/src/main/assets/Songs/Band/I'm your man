[V1]
 I heard you're looking for some rockin' blues
 The kind that makes you wanna pop your shoes
 Well you found it, I'm your man
 Just some changes with the drivin' beat
 Ought to knock you right off your feet
 You found it, I'm your man  Oh yeah  I'm your man

[B] 
 I'm here to do the best I can, yeah I came to play
 I'm your quick draw guitar man, everybody get out my way, Oh yeah

[V2]
 No need to tell me, I can read your mind
 I know your looking for a real good time
 You found it, I'm your man
 I'll make you feel so good inside
 This groove will keep you satisfied
 You found it, I'm your man, hell yeah, I'm your man

[B]
 I got an itch in my trigger finger. and I came to play
 I'm your lone star guitar slinger, everybody get out my way, Oh yeah

[V3]
 No need to tell me, I can read your mind
 I know your looking for a real good time
 You found it, I'm your man, I'm your man baby

[Solo]

[B] 
 I'm here to do the best I can, yeah I came to play
 I'm your quick draw guitar man, everybody get out my way, Oh yeah

[V4]
 I heard you're looking for some rockin' blues
 The kind that makes you wanna pop your shoes
 Well you found it, I'm your man</lyrics>

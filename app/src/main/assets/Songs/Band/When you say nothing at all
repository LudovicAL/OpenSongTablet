  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G    D    C    D    G    D    C    D 

[V1]
.G     D          C              D           G  D  C  D
 It's amazing how you, can speak right to my heart
.G       D        C             D            G  D  C  D
 Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
.C2 (bass in)       D
 Try as I may I can never explain
.G      D             C           D   (D first time only)
 What I hear when you don't say a thing 

[C]
.    G             D             C             D
 The smile on your face, lets me know that you need me
.          G             D           C            D
 There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
.    G             D                C                D  Em7 D/F#	
 The touch of your hand says you'll catch wherever I fall
.C2/G           D...                      G  D  C  D  G  D  C  D
 You say it best, when you say nothing at all 

[V2]
.G       D          C           D           G   D   C  D
 All day long I can hear people talking out loud  (Oooh)
.Em       Bm          C         D             G  D  C  D
 But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
.C2                        D
 Try as they may, they can never define
.G            D            C              D
 What's being said between your heart and mine

[C]
.    G             D             C             D
 The smile on your face, lets me know that you need me
.          G             D           C            D
 There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
.    G             D                C                D  Em7 D/F#	
 The touch of your hand says you'll catch wherever I fall
.C2/G           D...                      (E)
 You say it best, when you say nothing at all

[C]
.    G             D             C             D

.          G             D/F#        C/E ...(Drums/bass out)...  C   D	
 There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
.    G             D                C                   D Em D/F#
 The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall

 That smile on your face, that truth in your eyes
.G          D                 C          D
 You say it best when you say nothing at all

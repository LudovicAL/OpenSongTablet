  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Em      x4

[V1]
.Em               D    Am Bm             Em
 You do something to me,  something deep inside
.                   D  Am         Bm              Em 
 I'm hanging on the wire, for the love I'll never find
.                 D          Am  Bm           Em 
 You do something wonderful, you chase it all away
.          D       Am   Bm             Em 
 Mixing my emotions, it throws me back again
.               C/G         Am  Bm            *Em........C 
 Hanging on the wire, yeah, I'm waiting for my change
.                        G            Am 
 I'm dancing through the fire just to catch a flame
.   C         C/D   Em
 To feel again

 I'm hoping to get close to you, a peace I cannot find

.            G              Am              C            C/D  Em
 Just to get close to, just close enough to tell you that
.                 D   Am Bm               Em   
 You do something to me, something deep inside

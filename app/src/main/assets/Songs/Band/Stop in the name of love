  <lyrics>[C]
.(F) Dm                        Bb         C
     Stop in the name of love, before you break my heart
.(F) Dm                        Bb         C
     Stop in the name of love, before you tear it apart
.         F  Bb/F        F   Bb/F
 Think it over, think it over......

[V1]
.F                 Am/E
 You know baby I’m aware of where you go 
.Cm/Eb         D7
 Each time you leave my door
.Bb                C
 Watch you walking down the street 
.Gm                       C
 Knowing love, you’re the love for me
.F                    Am
 This time before you run to her
.Bb         Bbm
 Leavin’ me alone and hurt
.         F  Bb/F        F  Bb/F
 Think it over, think it over

[V2]
 I’ve known of your oh so foolish nights
 I’ve even seen you maybe once or twice
 But it’s your innocent expression
 Worth more than my love and affection
 This time before you leave my heart
 And rush off into her arms
 Think it over, think it over</lyrics>

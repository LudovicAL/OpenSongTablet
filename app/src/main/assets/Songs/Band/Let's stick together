  <lyrics>;INTRO AS VERSE

[V1]
.            A
 And now the marriage vow is very sacred
.
 The man has put us together now
.                             D
 You ought to make it stick together
.                             A      Asus  A
 Come on, come on and stick together
.            E             D                 A     E
 You know we made a vow to leave one another never

[V2]
 But now you never miss your water till your well is dry
 Come on now baby give our love a try
 Let's stick together, c'mon c'mon let's stick together
 You know we made a vow to leave one another never

[SOLO]
;As verse

[V3]
 Then if you're stuck for a while consider our child
 How can it be happy without its ma and pa
 Let's stick together, c'mon c'mon let's stick together
 You know we made a vow to leave one another never

[V2]

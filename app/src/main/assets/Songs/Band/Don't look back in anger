  <lyrics>[V1]
.C               G           Am 
 Slip inside the eye of your mind 
.          E              F   G                   C   Am  G 
 Don't you know you might find, a better place to play 
.C             G           Am 
 You said that you'd never been 
.            E                  F   G            C   Am  G 
 And all the things that you've seen slowly fade away 
.F                Fm             C 
 So I start a revolution from my bed 
.          F                 Fm             C 
 Cause you said the brains I had went to my head 
.F                 Fm              C 
 Step outside, the summertime's in bloom 
.G                             E/G# 
 Stand up beside the fireplace take that look from off your face 
.Am             G             F        G 
 You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out 

[C]
.C  G         Am        E              F             G          C   Am G 
 So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late as we're walking on by 
.    C    G       Am  E               F            G 
 Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger                       
.            C   (G Am E  F G C Am G) - 1st time only - else   Am G 
 I heard you say        

[V2]
 Take me to the place that you know 
 Where nobody goes, if it's not all day 
 Please don't put your life in the hands 
 Of a rock and roll band and throw it all away 
 I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed 
 Cause you said the brains I had went to my head 
 Step outside the summertime's in bloom 
 Stand up beside the fireplace take that look from off your face 
 You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[OUTRO]
.               F                         Fm 
 But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger 
.            C    G    Am    E    F    G            C 
 I heard you say                        least not today</lyrics>

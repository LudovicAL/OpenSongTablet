  <lyrics>[V1]
.Ab             Ab/F#             Fm    E 
 Thanks for the times that you've given me 
.    Ab           Ab/F#     Fm    E 
 The memories are all in my mind 
.    Ab             Ab/F#       Fm         E 
 And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow 
.        Ab          Ab/F#        Fm    E 
 There's something I must say out loud

 You're once, twice, three times a lady 
.Bbm   Ab   Eb  Eb/Db 
 And I love you 
.           Ab    Eb/Ab  Gb            Db 
 Yes you're once, twice, three times a lady 
.Bbm   Ab   Eb  Eb/Db  Eb/C  Eb/Bb Ab 
 And I love you            I love  you

[V2]
.     Ab       Ab/F#      Fm        E 
 When we are together the moments I cherish 
.     Ab    Ab/F#      Fm   E 
 With every beat of my heart 
.   Ab            Ab/F#        Fm           E 
 To touch you, to hold you, to feel you, to know you 
.        Ab         Ab/F#   Fm   E 
 There's nothing to keep us apart</lyrics>

 (oh what?   1..2..3..4)

[INTRO]
;12 BAR BLUES IN D WITH MAIN RIFF

[V1]
.           D
 I've got a sheet for my bed and a pillow for my head
.                                                     D7
 I've got a pencil full of lead and some water for my throat
.         G
 I've got buttons for my coat and sails on my boat
.D
 So much more than I needed before
.      A7                       G
 I got money in the meter and a two bar heater
.    D                                                (A7)
 Now it's getting hotter, oh it's only getting sweeter

[V2]
 I got legs on my chair and a head full of hair
 Pot and a pan and some shoes on my feet;
 I got a shelf full of books and most of my teeth
 A few pairs of socks and a door with a lock;
 I got food in my belly and a license for my telly
 And nothing's gonna bring me down

[BREAK]
;12 BAR BLUES IN D WITH MAIN RIFF

[V3]
 I got a nice guitar and tyres on my car
 I got most of the means and scripts for the scenes
 I'm out and about, so I'm in with a shout
 I got a fair bit of chat but better than that
 Food in my belly and a license for my telly
 And nothing's going to bring me down

[SOLO KEYBOARD]
;12 BAR BLUES IN D WITH MAIN RIFF

[C]
 But best of all (best of all), I've got my baby
 But best of all (best of all), I've got my baby
 She's mighty fine and says she's all mine
 And nothing's going to bring me down

[SOLO KEYBOARD]

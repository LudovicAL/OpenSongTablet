  <lyrics>[V1]
.           A                C#m/G#        F#m
 I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste, a flannel for my face
.B/D#                      Dm
 Pyjamas, a hairbrush, new shoes and a case
.  Am                                Em               F/G  G   C
 I said to my reflection, "let's get out of this place"
.           D                           F
 Passed the church and the steeple, the laundry on the hill
.A                             G/D            B/D#
 Billboards and the buildings, memories of it still keep
.Am/E       D            Am/E         F/D#      D    D/C
 Calling and calling, But forget it all I know I will

[C]
.A              A/G       D/F#  D A               A/G         D/F#    D
 Tempted by the fruit of another, tempted but the truth is discovered
.            B                 E                        A    A/G
 What's been going on, Now that you have gone, there's no other
.D/F#           D         A   A/G D/F#            D           Bm      Dm
 Tempted by the fruit of another, Tempted but the truth is discovered        

[V2]
.           A            C#m/G#       F#m
 I'm at the carpark, the airport, the baggage carousel
.    B/D#                           Dm
 The people keep on grabbing, ain't wishing I was well
.  Am                               Em         F/G     G    C
 I said, "It's no occasion, it's no story I can tell"
.      D                        F
 At my bedside, empty pocket, a foot without a sock
.     A                        G/D            B/D#
 Your body gets much closer, I fumble for the clock
. Am/E           D          Am/E F/D#          D     D/C
 Alarmed by the seduction, I wish that it would stop

;Chorus

[V3]
.           A           C#m/G#     F#m
 I bought a novel, some perfume, a fortune over you
.    B/D#                         Dm
 But it is not my conscience that hates to be untrue
.  Am/E                            Em              F/D#   D    D/C
 I asked of my reflection, "tell me what is there to do"

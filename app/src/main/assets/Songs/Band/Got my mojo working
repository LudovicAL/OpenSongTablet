  <lyrics>[V1]
 Got my mojo working, but it just don't work on you
 Got my mojo working, but it just don't work on you
 I wanna love you so bad child, don't know what to do

[V2]
 I'm going down to Louisianna to get me a mojo there
 I'm going down to Louisianna to get me a mojo there
 I'm gonna have all you women, wretch on my command

[C]
 Got my mojo working, got my mojo working
 Got my mojo working, got my mojo working
 Got my mojo working, but it just don't work on you</lyrics>

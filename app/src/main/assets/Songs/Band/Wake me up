  <title>Wake me up</title>
  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Bm     G      D      D ' A '         (all through song)

[V1]
 Feeling my way through the darkness
 Guided by a beating heart
 I can't tell where the journey will end
 But I know where to start
 They tell me I'm too young to understand
 They say I'm caught up in a dream
 Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
 Well that's fine by me

[C x2]
 So wake me up when it's all over
 When I'm wiser and I'm older
 All this time I was finding myself
 And I didn't know I was lost

[BREAK + RIFF]
;x 8

[V2]
 I tried carrying the weight of the world
 But I only have two hands
 Hope I get the chance to travel the world
 But I don't have any plans
 Wish that I could stay forever this young
 Not afraid to close my eyes
 Life's a game made for everyone
 And love is the prize

[C x2]
;(repeat last line  x4)

[BREAK + RIFF]
;x 8

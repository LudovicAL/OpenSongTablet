  <lyrics>[INTRO (Guitar riff)]
.G

[V1]
.      G
 I can feel a new expression on my face
.                                      D
 I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
.      C                D              G    Em
 I can hear the guitars playing lovely tunes
.C     G/B       D               G
 Every time that you walk in the room

[V2]
 I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
 Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
 I see a summer's night with a magic moon
 Every time that you walk in the room
 
[B]
.C  G/B       D
 Maybe it's a dream come true
.C       G/B        D
 Walking right alongside of you
.G                         Em
 Wish I could tell you how much I care
.A7                           D     D/C  D
 But I only have the nerve to stare

[V3]
 I can feel-a something pounding in my brain
 Just anytime that someone speaks your name
 Trumpets sound and I hear thunder boom
 Every time that you walk in the room</lyrics></song>

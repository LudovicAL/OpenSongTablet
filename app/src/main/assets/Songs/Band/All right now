  <lyrics>[V1]
.          A        D   A
 There she stood in the street
.D/G              D/F#        A
 Smiling from her head to her feet
.       A         D  A    	
 I said hey, what is this now baby
.D/G             D/F#      A
 Maybe, she's in need of a kiss
.       A           D    A  
 I said hey, what's your name baby
.D/G          D/F#           A 	
 Maybe we can see things the same
.              A    D  A
 Now don't you wait or hesitate
.      D/G              D/F#              A
 Let's move before they raise the parking rate

[C]
.A         G/A            D/A       A
 All right now, baby it's all right now
.A         G/A            D/A       A
 All right now, baby it's all right now

[V2]
 I took her home to my place, 
 Watching every move on her face
 She said look, what's your game baby
 Are you trying to put me in shame
 I said slow, don't go so fast, 
 Don't you think that love can last
 She said Lord, Lord above, 
 Now you're trying to trick me into love

[Chorus x2]

[Instrumental]
.A   A/G  A/F#.... etc.    A  A/G  A/F# E (last time)
 
[Chorus to end]</lyrics></song>

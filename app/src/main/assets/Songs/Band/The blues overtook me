[V1]
 The blues overtook me when I was a little child
 You know the blues overtook me when I was a little child
 You know fast women and whisky made this southern boy wild

[V2]
 When I was a kid, early on my own, I took the highway to be my own
 And the blues overtook me when I was a little child
 You know fast women and whisky made this lonesome boy wild

;SOLO

[V3]
 It's dark and cloudy, I believe it's gonna rain
 It makes me wanna hear my baby call my name
 And the blues overtook me, when I was a little child
 You know fast women and whisky made this poor boy wild

[V4]
 When you get it trouble, everybody's down on you
 The blues will overtake you and pull you through 
 I know the blues overtook me when I was a little child
 You know fast women and whisky made this lonesome boy wild

;SOLO

[V5]
 Hand me down my suitcase, pack up my trunk
 I ain't been drinking it's the blue made me drunk
 The blues overtook me when I was a little child
 You know fast women and whisky made this poor boy wild

[V6]
 He might run and try to escape
 But the blues will overtake you one rainy day
 The blues overtook me when I was a little child
 You know fast women and whisky made this southern boy wild</lyrics>

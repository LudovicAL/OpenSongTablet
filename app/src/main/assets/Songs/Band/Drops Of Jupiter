[[Verse 1]]
 
.A
 Now that she's back in the atmosphere 
.E                                   D
 With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey 
.A
 She acts like summer and walks like rain 
.E                                        D
 Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey 
.A
 Since the return from her stay on the moon 
.E                                                 D
 She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey 
 
 
[Hook 1]
 
.E                                B
 Tell me did you sail across the sun 
.                              D                              A
 Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded 
 And that heaven is overrated 
.E                                      B
 Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star 
.                          Bm
 One without a permanent scar 
                                     
 And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there 
 
 
[[Verse 2]]
 
.A
 Now that she's back from that soul vacation 
.E                                           D
 Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey 
.A
 She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo 
.E                                      D
 Reminds me that there's time to grow, hey, hey 
.A
 Now that she's back in the atmosphere 
.E                                          D
 I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane 
 Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 
 
 
[Hook 2]
 
.E                                        B
 Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet 
.                                   D                           A
 Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day            
 And head back to the Milky Way 
.E                                 B
 And tell me, did Venus blow your mind 
.                                 Bm
 Was it everything you wanted to find 
                                     
 And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
 
 
[[Bridge]]
 
.                 A
 Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken 
.E                                D
 Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong 
.                    A                                 E
 Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation 
.D
 The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me 
 
 
[Outro]
 
.E                                        B
 Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet 
.                                D                               A
 Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day 
 And head back toward the Milky Way 
.E                                B
 Tell me did you sail across the sun 
.                              D                              A
 Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded 
 And that heaven is overrated 
.E                                      B
 Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star 
.                          Bm
 One without a permanent scar 
                                     
 And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there

  <lyrics>[V1]
.             Am7  D               G    D/B         Em
 So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
.           Am7    D              G    D/B       Em
 I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot away from you 
.           Am7         D            G       D/B          Em
 And if you leave here, You leave me broken, shattered, I lie 
.           Am7      D            G     D/B         Em 
 I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot, then we can die 
.G    A    Em      G    A    Em
 .............................................
.G      D          F            C    Em   (slow down)
 I know I won't be leaving here with you 

[GUITAR THEME]
.Em      Am   Bm   x2

[V2]
.Em                                            Am    Bm      Em
 I say don't you know, you say you don't know, I say take me out!
.Em                                              Am    Bm      Em
 I say you don't show, don't move, time is slow, I say take me out! 

;GUITAR THEME

[V3]
 I say you don't know, you say you don't go, I say â€¦ take me out!
 If I move this could die, If eyes move this can die, 
 I want you...to take me out!    (STAY ON Em FOR 2 BARS)

[C]
.Am                C            D  
 I know I won't be leaving here (with you)   x4

;GUITAR THEME

[V4]
 I say don't you know, you say you don't know, I say... take me out!
 If I wait, this can die, If I wane, this can die,
 I want you to take me out
 If I move, this could die, If eyes move, this can die, 
 Come on   (STOP) take me out

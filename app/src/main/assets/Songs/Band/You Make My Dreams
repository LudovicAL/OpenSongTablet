[V1]
.       F                                       F
 What I want you've got and it might be hard to handle
.                              F           G7               Bb
 Like the flame that burns the candle, the candle feeds the flame, yeah, yeah
.          F                                            F
 What I've got's full stock of thoughts and dreams that scatter
.                       F            G7             Bb
 Then you pull them all together and how I can't explain, Oh, yeah....

[C]
.           Gm
 Well, well you (Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo)
.C7                      F
 You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
.                 Bb
 Well, well, well you (You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh), Oh, yeah
.C7                      F
 You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
 
[V2]
 On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
 When they're messin' with the dreamer I can laugh it in the face
 Twist and shout my way out and wrap yourself around me
 'Cos I ain't the way you found me and I'll never be the same, Oh, yeah...

[C]
 Well, 'cos you (Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo)
 You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo), 
 Well, well, well you (You-hoo, hoo-hoo-oo)
 You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo) Whoa yeah
 
[B]
.           Eb  Bb F      Eb  Bb F7     Eb Dm             Gm
 Listen to this.                         I'm down on my daydream
.         Bb                                Fsus4....
 Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now I know

[C]
 'Bout you, Yeah, yeah
 You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo) Oh, yeah
 I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl(You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh) Oh, yeah
 You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
                                       Me, you, me, you, me

 I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl (You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
 You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
 I've been waiting for, waiting for you, waiting for, waiting for, waiting for,
 You make my dreams (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo
 I've been waiting for you girl (You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
 You make my dreams

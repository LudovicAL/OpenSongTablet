[V1]
.          Fm                   Bb        Eb      Bb/D    Cm

 It's a supernatural delight, everybody's dancing in the moonlight

 Everybody here is out of sight, they don't bark and they don't bite
 They keep things loose, they keep it right
 Everybody's dancing in the moonlight

 Everybody's feeling warm and bright
.            Fm                    Bb
 It's such a fine and natural sight
.            Eb      Bb/D   Cm

 You can't dance and stay uptight
 It's a supernatural delight, everybody's dancing in the moonlight

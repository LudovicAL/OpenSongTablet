.D      F G F    x2

[V1]
.D
 Wake up little Susie, wake up.  Wake up little Susie, wake up
.      G
 We've both been sound asleep, wake up little Susie and weep
.
 The movie's over it's four o'clock and we're in trouble deep
.               A      G              A
 Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie
[C]
.     A
 Well what're we gonna tell your mama
.
 What're we gonna tell your pa
.
 What're we gonna tell our friends
.              A
 When they say ooh la la
.               D      A              D
 Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie

[V2]
 Well I told your mama that you'd be in by ten
 Well Susie looks like we goofed again
 Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie
 We gotta go home

[V3]
 Wake up little Susie, wake up
 The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot
 We fell asleep our goose is cooked our reputation is shot
 Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie

[C]

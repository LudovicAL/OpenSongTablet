  <lyrics>[V1]
.       D          G      D
 Silver coins that jingle jangle
.      D                   A
 Fancy shoes that dance in time
.       D       G      D
 Oh the secrets of her dark eyes,
.         D    A       D
 They did sing a gypsy rhyme

[V2]
 Yellow clover in tangled blossoms
 In a meadow silky green
 Where she held me to her bosom,
 Just a boy of seventeen
 
[C]
.    G            D
 I recall a gypsy woman
.       D               A
 Silver spangles in her eyes
.      D    G           D
 Ivory skin against the moonlight
.        D     A               D
 And the taste of lifeâ€™s sweet wine

[V3]
 Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows
 And stir the darkness in my mind
 Oh gentle woman you sleep beside me
 Little know who haunts my mind

[V4]
 Gypsy lady I hear your laughter
 And it dances in my head
 While my tender wife and babies
 Slumber softly in their beds

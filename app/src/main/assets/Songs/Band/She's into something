[Intro]
'Say what she do?'

[V1]
A snapping of her finger makes a dog wag its tail
A whistle from her voice makes a train jump the rails
Take her to a race track and show her favourites
A horse that ain't won in years, comes in first place

[C]
You know that she's into something
Yeah, she's into something
Shes into something, you should be into something too

[V2]
Well you laughed at her about a week ago
Now she's met a man with a whole lotta dough
And oh yeah he's rich and I've seen the money
All she had to do is call the man 'honey'

[C2]
Honey, honey, she's into something
Yeah, she's into somethting
Man, she's into something, you should be into something too

;SOLO (changes feel for 2nd solo, then returns for next verse)

[V3]
Every day of her life, she rides around on wheels
And oh yeah you might say she got herself a stone cold deal
One thing the girl , she don't have to do
Is worry about no money when the payment's due

[C3]
You know she's into something
Yeah, she's into somethting
Man, she's into something, you should be into something too

[Outro]
Hey, Hey, mmm, mmm (for a verse)</lyrics>

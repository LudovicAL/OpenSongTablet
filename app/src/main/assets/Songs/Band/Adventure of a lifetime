.Dm   G   Am   Am    Em (Dm)

[V1]
 Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
 Everything you want's a dream away
 And we are legends every day, that's what she told me

[V2] 
 Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
 Everything you want's a dream away
 Under this pressure, under this weight, we are diamonds

[C]
 Now I feel my heart beating
 I feel my heart underneath my skin
 And I feel my heart beating
 Oh, you make me feel, like I'm alive again, alive again
 Oh, you make me feel, Like I'm alive again
 
[V3]
 Said I can't go on, not in this way
 I'm a dream that died by light of day
 Gonna hold up half the sky and say, only I own me

[C]

[Mid8]
 Turn your magic on, to me, she'd say
 Everything you want's a dream away
 Under this pressure under this weight
 We are diamonds taking shape, we are diamonds taking shape

[C2]
 If we've only got this life, this adventure, oh, then I
 And if we've only got this life, you get me through
 And if we've only got this life, in this adventure, oh, then I
 Want to share it with you, with you
 With you, Yeah I do
 Woohoo, Woohoo, Woohoo .....</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                              Em    
 Let me tell you 'bout a place, somewhere on New York Way
.C                            D7
 Where the people are so gay, Twistin' the night away
.G                            Em    
 Here they have a lot of fun, puttin' supper on the run
.C                                D7                 G
 Here you find the old and young, Twistin' the night away

[C]
.G    
 Twistin', twistin', everybody's doin' great
.        C                   D7                 G
 They're twistin', twistin', twistin' the night away

[V2]
 Here's a man in evening clothes,how he got here I don't know
 But man, you oughta see him go, twistin' the night away
 He's dancin' with a chick in slacks, she's a-movin' up and back
 Oh man, there ain't nothin' like twistin' the night away

;CHORUS

[V3]
 Here's a fella in blue jeans, dancin' with an older queen
 Who's wearin' diamond rings, twistin' the night away
 Man, you oughta see her go, twistin' to the rock and roll
 Here you find the young and old, twistin' the night away

;CHORUS

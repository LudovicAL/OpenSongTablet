.    E                  B          B7                   E
 Hey Jude don't make it bad take a sad song and make it better
.  A                           E              
 Remember to let her into your heart 
.                 B7               E
 And then you can start to make it better
 
[V2]
 Hey Jude dont be afraid you were made to go out and get her
 The minute you let her under your skin 
.                                    (E7)
 Then you begin to make it better

[C]
.                         A        E/G#   F#m7  
 And anytime you feel the pain hey Jude refrain 
.     F#m7/E    B7              E          E7
 Dont carry the world upon your shoulders
.                            A        E/G#     F#m7  
 For now you know that its a fool who plays it cool 
.   F#m7/E     B7             E              E7      B7
 By making his world a little colder,  da da da da   Da da da da  Da
 
[V3]
 Hey Jude don't let me down, you have found her now go and get her
  Remember to let her into you heart 
 Then you can start to make it better

[C2]
 So let it out and let it in Hey Jude begin 
 Your waiting for someone to perform with
 And don't you know that its just you Hey Jude you'll do 
 Da movement you need is on your shoulders, da da da da  Da da da da  Da

[V4]
 Hey Jude dont make it bad take a sad song and make it better
 Remember to let her into your skin 
 And then you can begin to make it better
 Better, better, better, better, better, aaaaaooooow

[OUTRO]
.E           D         A             E
 Na, na, na, nananana, nananana, hey Jude

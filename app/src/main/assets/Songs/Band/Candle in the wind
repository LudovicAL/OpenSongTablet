.F    Bb  Bb/A  Bb/G  F    C  

[V1]
.F                                  Bb 
 Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all 
.                     F                                     Bb 
 You had the grace to hold yourself  while those around you crawled
.                        F 
 They crawled out of the woodwork 
.         Bb 
 And they whispered into your brain 
.                  F                                       Bb
 They set you on a treadmill and they made you change your name
 
[C]
.       C  
 And it seems to me you lived your life 
.       F             Bb 
 Like a candle in the wind 
.      F                  
 Never knowing who to cling to 
.         C 
 When the rain set in 
.      Bb 
 And I would have liked to known you 
.          Dm 
 But I was just a kid 
.                       C 
 Your candle burned out long before 
.     Bb                Bb Bb/A Bb/G   F   C   x2 
 Your legend ever did 

[V2]
 Loneliness was tough, the toughest role you ever played 
 Hollywood created a superstar, pain was the price you paid 
 Even when you died, oh the press still hounded you 
 All the papers had to say 
 Marilyn was found in the nude</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Em7  A7sus4  (x4)

[V1]
.                   Em7                 A7sus4
 Walking 'round the room singing Stormy Weather
.   Em7               A7sus4
 At 57 Mount Pleasant Street
.             Em7                        A7sus4
 Now it's the same room but everything's different
.                  Em7               A7sus4
 You can fight the sleep but not the dream

[Mid 8]
.Dm           C       Dm    C        Dm       C              F
 Things ain't cookin' in my kitchen, strange affliction wash over me
.Dm     C      Dm            C      Dm       C           F       G 
 Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire couldn't conquer the blue sky

[BREAK]
.Em7   A7sus4 (x2)

[V2]
 There's a small boat made of china
 Going nowhere on the mantlepiece
 Do I lie like a loungeroom lizard
 Or do I sing like a bird released?

[C]
.               A7sus4                  D
 Everywhere you go, you always take the weather with you
.               A7sus4                  D
 Everywhere you go, you always take the weather
.               A7sus4                  G
 Everywhere you go, you always take the weather with you
.               D/F#                    Em7          A           (Em7)
 Everywhere you go, you always take the weather, the weather with you

[C2]
.               A7sus4                  D
 Everywhere you go, you always take the weather with you

 Everywhere you go, you always take the weather

 Everywhere you go, you always take the weather with you

 Everywhere you go, you always take the weather,

  <lyrics>;PART OF A MEDLEY

[Intro]
 Bass/Piano riff

[V1]
.  Am                                 E/G#                         E        Am
 I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay, ain't it sad
.    Am                              E/G#                      E          Am
 And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me, that's too bad
.Dm/A  Am       E/A    Am  G F                     F  F/E
 In my dreams I have a plan, if I got me a wealthy man
.  Dm                                B/D#                   E7
 I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...

[C]
.Am                   B              Dm     E7         Am
 Money, money, money, must be funny, in the rich man's world
.Am                   B             Dm     E7         Am
 Money, money, money, always sunny, in the rich man's world
.Dm   E     A                      Dm
 Aha-ahaaa, all the things I could do
.F  E7 Am                  Dm     E7         Am
 If I  had a little money, it's a rich man's world

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.A     F#m

[V1]
.A                                    
 I was there to witness Candice's in her buisness
.    F#m
 She wants the boys to notice her rainbows, and her ponies
.A 
 She was educated but could not count to ten
.            F#m                          D
 Now she got lots of different horses, by lots of different men 
.            A
 (And I say) Liberate your sons and daughters
.    F#m
 The bush is hot but in the hole there's water
.A                                    F#m                 D
 You can get some, when they give it, nothing sacred, but it's a living

[C]
.A                      
 Hey, ho, here she goes
.         F#m          
 Either a little too high or a little too low
.    D
 Got no self-esteem and vertigo
.           D
 'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
.A
 Hey, ho, here she goes
.         F#m
 Either a little too loud or a little too close
.      D            
 Got a hurricane at the back of her throat
.    D           
 She thinks she's made of candy

;BREAK AS INTRO

[V2]
 Ring a ring of roses, whoever gets the closest
 She comes and she goes as the war of the roses
 Mother was a victim, father beat the system
 By moving bricks to Brixton and learning how to fix them
 Liberate your sons and daughters
 The bush is high but in the hole there's water
 As you will she'll be the Hollywood love,
 And if it don't feel good what are you doing it for (now tell me)

;CHORUS

[V3]
 Liberate your sons and daughters
 The bush is high but in the hole there's water
 As you will she'll be the Hollywood love
 And if you don't feel good ,what are you doing it for?
.             A                      
 What are you doing it for? What are you doing it for?
.             F#m                        D
 What are you doing it for? What are you doing it for?
.             A                      
 What are you doing it for? What are you doing it for?
.             F#m                        D
 What are you doing it for? What are you doing it for?

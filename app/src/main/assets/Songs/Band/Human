  <lyrics>[V1]
.  Bb             Bb/D            Eb                 Bb    
 I did my best to notice when the call came down the line.
.          F              Gm           Eb                 F
 Up to the platform of surrender I was brought, but I was kind.
.    Bb              Bb/D           Eb          Gm
 And sometimes I get nervous when I see an open door.
.           Eb               Eb           F              (Bb)
 Close your eyes, clear your heart.............   cut the cord

[C]
.Bb     Bb/D   Eb        Bb       F          Gm     Eb           F
 Are we human, or are we dancer?  My sign is vital, my hands are cold
.        Bb    Bb/D                  Gm
 And I'm on my knees looking for the answer. 
.       Cm     Eb        Bb  (pause x2)                                   
 Are we human, or are we dancer?

[V2]
 Pay my respects to grace and virtue, send my condolences to good.
 Give my regards to stolen romance, they always did the best they could.
 And so long to devotion, you taught me everything I know.
 Wave goodbye, wish me well..............   You got to let me go

;Chorus

[Mid 8]
.Bb/D      Eb          F               F#dim7          Gm
 Will your system be alright, when you dream of home tonight?
.      Eb                             F
 There is no message weâ€™re receiving, let me know is your heart still beating?

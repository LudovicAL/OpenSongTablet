  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.C   C7sus4    x2

[V1]
.C                        Am                              
 There is freedom within, there is freedom without
.F                                  E   G
 Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
.C                       Am          
 There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
.F            
 But you'll never see the end of the road
.             E 
 While you're travelling with me

[C]
.F        G              C          Am  
 Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
.F        G                 C           Am  
 Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
.F          G         C                 Am  
 They come, they come to build a wall between us
.F                    F  G
 We know they won't win

[V2]
 Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
 My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
 In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
 But you turn right over to the T.V. page

;CHORUS  

[V3]
 Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
 And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
 Only the shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
 Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

;CHORUS      x2

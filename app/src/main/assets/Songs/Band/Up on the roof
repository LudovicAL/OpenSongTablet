  <lyrics>[V1]
.     G                     Em
 When this old world starts gettin' me down,
    C                   D              G
 And people are just too much for me to face (up on the roof)
.G                     Em
 I climb way up to the top of the stairs, 
.    C                 D                G
 And all my cares just drift right into space (up on the roof)
.C                 Cmaj7           C   Cmaj7       
 On the roof, it's peaceful as can be, 
.    G                 Em               Am7     
 And there the world below can't bother me
.D                   G                      
 Let me tell you now

[V2]
 When I come home feelin' tired and beat,
 I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet (up on the roof)
 I get away from the hustling crowd 
 And all that rat-race noise down in the street (up on the roof)
 On the roof, the only place I know, 
 Where you just have to wish to make it so
 Up on the roof (up on the roof)

[Mid 8]
.   C                   Cmaj7         C   Cmaj7     
 At night the stars put on a show for free, 
.     G                Em                Am7     
 And, darling, you can share it all with me
.  D                 (G)
 I keep a-tellin' you

[V3]
 Right smack dab in the middle of town, 
 I've found a paradise that's trouble proof (up on the roof)
 And if this world starts getting you down 
 There's room enough for two
 Up on the roof (up on the roof)   
 Up on the roo-oo-oof (up on the roof) ...</lyrics>

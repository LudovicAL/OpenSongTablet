.F "  Dm "  Gm7 "  C "   

[V1]
.F                         Dm
 When no one else can understand me
.Gm7                     C
 When everything I do is wrong
.F                         Dm
 You give me love and consolation
.Gm7                       C
 You give me hope to carry on 
.        F                F/A
 And you try to show your love for me 
.   Bb   C         D  D/E  D/F#
 In everything you do
.           Gm7   C...            F   Dm  Gm7  C
 That's the wonder, the wonder of you

[V2]
 And when you smile the world is brighter
 You touch my hand and I'm a king
 Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
 Your love to me is everything
 And you're always there to lend a hand
 In all I try to do
 That's the wonder, the wonder of you

[V3]
 You'll never know how much I love you
 My love is yours and yours alone
 And it's so wonderful to have you
 To have you for my very own
 Guess I'll never know the reason why 
 You love me as you do
 That's the wonder, the wonder of you</lyrics>

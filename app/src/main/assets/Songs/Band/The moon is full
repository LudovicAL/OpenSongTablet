[INTRO]

[V1]
 And now the moon is full, 
 I feel my love coming down
 I said the moon is full, 
 I feel my love coming down
 You see I met this little girl, 
 I don't think I wanna, wanna, wanna leave this town

[V2]
 You see all my friends call me crazy, 
 They just don't know I feel inside
 I said all my friends call me cray,
 They just don't know I feel inside
 You see I love this little girl, 
 Cause she's got these pretty little brown eyes

;SOLO

[V3]
 I'm gonna catch that train in the morning, 
 I think I'm gonna go back home
 I said I'm gonna catch that train in the morning, 
 I think I'm gonna go back home
 I'm gonna let my little girl know, 
 I'll be gone, I won't be gone too long

[V4]
 If I miss that train, I guess 
 I'm gonna have to hitch hike
 I said If I miss that train, 
 I guess I'm gonna have to hitch hike
 I'm gonna let my little girl know, 
 I'll be gone, I'll be gone overnight</lyrics>

[V1] 
.G                D        C                    D 
 It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear 
.G               D       C               D 
 She puts on her make up and brushes her long blonde hair 
.C            D         G    D/F#   Em   Em/D 
 And then she asks me, 'Do I look alright ?' 
.            C             D           G  D  C  D   G  D  C  D 
 And I say, 'Yes, you look wonderful tonight' 

[V2]
.G          D     C            D 
 We go to a party and everyone turns to see 
.G              D    C              D 
 This beautiful lady who's walking around with me 
.C            D         G      D/F#   Em  Em/D 
 And then she asks me, 'Do you feel alright ?' 
.            C           D           G     G7 
 And I say, 'Yes, I feel wonderful tonight' 

[Mid 8]
.       C           D               G          D/F#    Em  Em/D 
 I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes 
.        C            D               C             D 
 And the wonder of it all is that you just don't realise 
.           G    D    C    D   G    D    C    D 
 How much I love you. 

[V3]
.G               D        C                      D 
 It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head 
.G                 D        C                   D 
 So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed 
.C          D        G    D/F#         Em   Em/D 
 And then I tell her as I turn out the light 
.           C                 D           G  D/F#  Em Em/D 
 I say, 'My darling, you were wonderful tonight' 
.           C                 D           G 
 I say, 'My darling, you were wonderful tonight'

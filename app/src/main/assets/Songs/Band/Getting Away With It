  <lyrics>[V1]
.Am                                      D  
 I've been walking in the rain just to get wet on purpose
 I've been forcing myself not to forget just to feel worse
 I've been getting away with it all my life (getting away)
 
[C]
.      F            G                Am                    D     
 However I look it's clear to see That I love you more than you love me
.      F            G                 Am                             
 However I look it's clear to see That I love you more than you love me

[V2]
.Am                                   D
 I hate that mirror, it makes me feel so worthless
 I'm an original sinner but when I'm with you couldn't care less
 I've been getting away with it all my life
 Getting away with it all my life
 
;(Back to Chorus then into solo using same chords)

[V3]
.Am                               D
 I thought I gave up falling in love a long long time ago
 I guess I like it but I can't tell you, you shouldn't really know
 And it's been true all my life
 Yes, it's been true all my life
 
;( Back to Chorus )

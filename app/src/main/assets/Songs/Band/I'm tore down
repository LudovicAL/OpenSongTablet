[C]
 I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
 I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
 Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found.

[V1]
 I went to the river to jump in.
 My baby showed up and said, "I will tell you when."

[C]
 Well, I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.
 Well, I feel like this when my baby can't be found.

[V2]
 I love you babe with all my heart and soul;
 Love like mine will never grow old.
 Love you in the morning and in the evening too.
 Every time you leave me I get mad with you.

[C]

[V3]
 I love you baby with all my might;
 Love like mine is out of sight.
 I'll lie for you if you want me to.
 I really don't believe that your love is true.

[C]

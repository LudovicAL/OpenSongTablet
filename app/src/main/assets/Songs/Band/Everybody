 We're so glad to see so many of you wonderful people 
 here tonight, and we would especially like to welcome 
 all the representatives of the Illinois law enforcement
 community, who have chosen to join us at the Palace 
 Hotel ballroom at this time. 
 We do sincerely hope that you all enjoy the show, and
 please remember people, that no matter who you are, 
 and what you do to live, thrive and survive, there are still 
 some things that make us all the same: You, me, them,
 EVERYBODY!

[Spoken]
 You know people when you find that somebody, hold that 
 woman, hold that man, hug him, squeeze him, please him. 
 Give them all your love, signify your feelings with every
 gentle caress, say it's so important to have that special 
 somebody to hold, miss, squeeze, and please

  <lyrics>[Intro]
.C    G/B           Am            F
 Hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey hey

[V1]
.     C               G/B                     Am              F
 Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
.                     C                          G/B             Am   F  G
 I knew I wouldn't forget you, and so I went and let you blow my mind
.     C                G/B                       Am                  F
 Your sweet moon beam, the smell of you in every single dream I dream
.                 C                               G/B                   Am  F   G
 I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

[C]
.F                G              C      G      F                 
 Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo, 
.    G                  C         G
 The way you move ain't fair, you know!
.F                G               C      G      F              G
 Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do...

[T]
.  C           G/B           Am           F
 Tonight, hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey hey hey

[V2]
 Just in time, I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
 You gave my life direction, a game show love connection we can't deny
 I'm so obsessed, my heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
 I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna, 
 And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

;CHORUS

[B]
.  C                                 G                              Am
 Tonight, the way you can cut a rug, watching you's the only drug I need
.Am                                  F
 So gangsta, I'm so thug, you're the only one I'm dreaming of
.    C                            G                                    Am
 You see, I can be myself now finally, in fact there's nothing I can't be
.                            F       G                
 I want the world to see you be with me

;CHORUS

[T]
.  C           G/B           Am           F
 Tonight, hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey hey hey
.  C           G/B           Am           F         C

[V1]
 I woke up this morning feeling a little down
 Walked down to my back yard took a good look around
 I walked down the hall, heard the telephone ring
 I went into the bathroom and I done my morning thing
 I walked into the kitchen sure was feeling good
 It was my wife's day to cook breakfast, just like I knew she would
 I look in on my children, still asleep in bed
 I had to thank the Lord cause neither one of them was dead

[C]
 Yeah this time, I just thought I had the blues
 Yeah this time, I just thought I had the blues

[V2]
 Sit down to my table, turn on the TV
 Saw a whole lotta people worse of than me
 Folks living in cardboard houses I did not understand
 Poor little children still make lunch out of a back street garbage can
 One mama thew her arms up she 'why, why, why, why?'
 Her child lay on the sidewalk cause the shooters just drove by

SOLO

[V3]
 Next time I get downhearted and feeling sad
 I'll take a good look around me cause I might not be doing so bad
 I'll quit worrying about my wardrobe for the fall
 There's too many people out there who ain't got no wardrobe at all
 Folks still starving, laying dead in the street
 While the greedy warlords stealing the food they've got to eat</lyrics>

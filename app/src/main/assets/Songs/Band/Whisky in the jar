 As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
.  C                           G
 I saw captain Farrell and his money he was counting
 I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
 I said stand or deliver or the devil he may take ya

 Musha ring dum a do dum a da
.C        
 Work for my daddy-o, work for my daddy-o
.        G                  
 There's whiskey in the jar-o

;GUITAR THEME

[V2]
 I took all his money and it was a pretty penny
 I took all his money and I brought it home to Molly
 She swore that she loved me never would she leave me
 But the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy

[V3]
 Being drunk and weary, I went to Molly's chamber
 Takin' my Molly with me and I never knew the danger
 For about six or maybe seven, in walked capt'n Farrell
 I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels

;CHORUS

;GUITAR THEME x1

[V4]
 Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'
 And some men like ta hear, the cannon ball a roarin'
 Me?  I like sleepin', especially in Molly's chamber
 But here I am in prison, here I am with ball and chain, yeah

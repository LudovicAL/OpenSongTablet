  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E  Bsus4  E  A9  x2

[V1]
.    E       Bsus4 E        A9
 Her name is Noel, I have a dream about her, 
.E            Bsus4       E            A9
 She rings my bell, I got gym class in half an hour
.    E          Bsus4    E             A9
 And oh how she rocks in Keds and tube socks 
.    C#m         A9         Bsus4  C#m         A9     Bsus4
 But she doesn't know who I am and she doesn't give a damn about me

[C]
.      E          A       B       C#m   G#m
 Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
.     E          A       B       C#m   G#m
 Yeah I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
.E         A    B      C#m  G#m    E   A  B  C#m G#m A  B 
 Listen to Iron Maiden maybe, with me, oooh

;AS INTRO

[V2]
 Her boyfriend's a dick, he brings a gun to school
 He'd simply kick my ass if he knew the truth
 He lives in my block and he drives an IROK
 But he doesn’t know who I am and he doesn't give a damn about me

;CHORUS

[Mid 8]
.E  A9 E A9  E  A9 E  A9 C#m G#m     A9             Bsus4
 And yeh,  Dirtbag,   no she doesn’t know what she’s missing     x2

;AS INTRO

[V3]
 Man I feel like mold, it's prom night and I am lonely 
 Lo and behold She's walkin' over to me 
 This must be fake, my lip starts to shake 
 How does she know who I am? 
 And why does she give a damn about me? 

[V4]
 I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby. 
 Come with me Friday, don't say maybe. 
 I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby...like you. oooh. 

;Mid 8  x2

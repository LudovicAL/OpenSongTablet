  <title>Another day in paradise</title>
  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Fm7   Eb   Bbm7  x2 

[V1]
.Fm7                  Eb         Bbm7 
 She calls out to the man on the street, 
.Fm7                 Eb 
 Saying 'Sir can you help me' 
.Fm7                Eb         Bbm7 
 It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep 
.Fm7                        Eb 
 Is there somewhere you can tell me 

[V2]
 He walks on and doesn't look back 
 He pretends he can't hear her 
 Starts to whistle as he crosses the street 
 Seems embarrassed to be there 

[C]
.Fm7       Eb/F             Dbmaj7/F                      Eb/F 
 Oh, think twice, 'Cos it's another day for you and me in paradise 
.Fm7       Eb/F             Dbmaj7/F                             
 Oh, think twice, 'Cos it's another day for you and me 
.Eb      Fm    Eb Db Fm   Eb  Bbm7 
 You and me in paradise 
.           Fm7  Eb Bbm7            Fm7 Eb Bbm7 
 Just think about it,    just think about it 

[V3]
 She calls out to the man on the street 
 He can see she's been crying 
 She's got blisters on the soles of her feet 
 She can't walk, but she's trying 

;CHORUS 

[Mid 8]
.Eb/G  Fm           Eb                   Ab  
 Oh, Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do 
.Eb/G  Fm                Eb                Ab 
 Oh, Lord, there must be something you can say 

[V4]
 You can tell from the lines on her face 
 You can see that she's been there 
 Probably been moved on from every place 
 'Cos she didn't fit in there 

;CHORUS

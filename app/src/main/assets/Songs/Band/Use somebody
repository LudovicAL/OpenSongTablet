.C    Em    F        C    Em    F
.Am   C     F        Am   C     F

[V1]
.                  C                     Em            F
 I've been roaming around, I was looking down at all I see
.        C              Em             F
 Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
.                      Am          C  F                        Am          C   F
 You know that I could use somebody,     you know that I could use somebody

[V2]
 Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
 Countless lovers under cover of the street
 You know that I could use somebody, you know that I could use somebody

[C]
.             C                     Em          F                              
 Someone like you  (oooh  waa  aah  ooh waa aah)
.             C                     Em          F                              
 Someone like you  (oooh  waa  aah  ooh waa aah)
.             C                     Em          F                              
 Someone like you  (oooh  waa  aah  ooh waa aah)
.             C                     Em          F                              
 Someone like you  (oooh  waa  aah  ooh waa aah)

[V3]
 Off in the night while you live it up I'm off to sleep
 Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat
 I hope it's gonna make you notice, I hope it's gonna make you notice

;Chorus


[Mid 8]
.D                     F#m
 Come let it out, Come let it out,  Come let it out, 
.     D                                  F#m               Bm
 Come let it out, Come let it out,  Come let it out,  Come let it out

[GUITAR]
.C          Em           F               Am            C            F

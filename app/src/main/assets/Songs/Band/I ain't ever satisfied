 I was born by the railroad tracks,
.G                                           G     C     D     G
 The train whistle wailed and I wailed right back
.     G                               G   C    D    G 
 Well papa left mama when I was quite young,  
.            G                                        G    C  D G  D/F#
 He said now one of these days you're gonna follow me son

[C]

 Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh I ain't ever satisfied
.Em         C           Em      C    D    G    
 Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh I ain't ever satisfied

[V2]
 Now I had me a woman, she was my world
 Yeah well I ran off with my back street girl
 Now my back street woman could not be true
 She left me standin' on the Boulevard thinkin' about you

;CHORUS

[BRIDGE]
.D                       C    Em  D   C   G  Am  G  
 I got and empty feeling deep inside
.D                     C Em  D
 I'm going over to the other side

[INSTRUMENTAL]
.Em  C  D  G  D/F#  Em   C   D  G   x2

[V3]
 Last night I dreamed I made it to the promised land
 I was standin' at the gate and I had the key in my hand
 St. Peter said come in boy, you're finally home
 I said 'no thanks Pete, I'll just be movin' along'

;CHORUS x2</lyrics>

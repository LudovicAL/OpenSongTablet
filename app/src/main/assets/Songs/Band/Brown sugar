[V1]
.C
 Gold coast slave she found work hard on fields
.F
 Sold in the market down in New Orleans
.C
 Scarred old slave, oh he's doing alright
.Bb                       C
 Hear him with the women just around midnight

[C]
.G            C
 Brown sugar, how come you taste so good
.G            C
 Brown sugar, just like a young girl should

[V2]
 Drums beatin' cold, English blood runs hot
 Lady of the house wondering where it's gonna stop
 Ah, though I know, slave is doin' all right
 You should'a heard him just around midnight
 
[C]

[V3] 
 I bet your momma was a chainsaw queen
 And all her boyfriends were sweet sixteen
 I'm no schoolboy, but I know what I like
 You should'a heard me just around midnight

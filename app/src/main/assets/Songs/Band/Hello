  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Am   G6   F   G6

[V1]
.     Am              G6            F    G6 
 I've been alone with you inside my mind 
.    Am                G6                 F        G6 
 And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times 
.    Am              G6              F    G6 
 Sometimes I see you pass outside my door 
.Am  G6       F                 A 
 Hello, is it me you're looking for? 

[C]
.      Dm7            G           C              F 
 I can see it in your eyes, I can see it in your smile            
.       Bb         E          Am       E7/B Am/C E7/B Am/C 
 You're all I ever wanted, my arms are open wide 
.          Dm7               G            C                 F 
 Cause you know just what to say, and you know just what to do 
.      Bb               E                (Am   G6   F   G6)  or (A to end)
 And I want to tell you so much, "I love you" 
 
[V2]                 
 I long to see the sunlight in your hair 
 And tell you time and time again, how much I care 
 Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow 
 Hello, I've just got to let you know 

[C2]
 Cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do 
 Are you somewhere feelin' lonely or is someone lovin' you? 
 Tell me how to win your heart, cause I haven't got a clue 
 And I want to tell you so much, "I love you"

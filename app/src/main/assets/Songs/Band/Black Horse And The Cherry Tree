  <lyrics>[Intro]
.no chord chops, then   Em   B7   Em  
 (woo-hoo, woo-hoo) [Throughout the whole song]

[V1]
 Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
 So I'm gonna let it do all the talking.
 I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
 With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
 I felt a little fear upon my back
 He said "Don't look back, just keep on walking.
 When the big black horse said "Look this way"
 Said, "Hey, lady, will you marry me?"
 
[C]
.   Em      D       Dmaj7     Cmaj7  Em   
 But I said no, no, no_____o, no-no-no
.Em     D       C7                    Em
 I said no, no, you're not the one for me
.Em  D   Dmaj7     Cmaj7 
 No, no, no-----o, no-no-no
.       Em  D   C7                    Em
 I said no, no, you're not the one for me
 
 N/C  (some woohoo____ooo-ing)

[V2]
 And my heart hit a problem, in the early hours,
 So I stopped it dead for a beat or two.
 But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done it,
 And it won't forgive me after all these years
 So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
 With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
 Now it won't come back, 'cause it's oh so happy
 And now I've got a hole for the world to see
 
;Chorus
;Acapella Chorus

[Outro]
.Em        D   Dmaj7    Cmaj7   Em
 Big black horse and a cherry tree
.Em        D                       C7               Em
 I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
.Em        D  Dmaj7    Cmaj7    Em   
 Big black horse and a cherry tree
.Em  D   Dmaj7 Cmaj7   Em
 No, no, no, no, no,no,no
.Em  D   Dmaj  Cmaj    Em   
 No, no, no, no, no,no,no
.Em            D                  C7               Em
 I can't quite get there cause my heart's forsaken me

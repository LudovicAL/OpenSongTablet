  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Dm  Eb  F     F       Bb   F   Ab  Eb    Bb   F   Ab   Eb

[V1]
.Bb     F         Ab             Eb          Bb   F   Ab  Eb
 Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
.Bb      F           Ab               Eb          Bb   F   Ab  Eb
 From my window, I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
.Bb        F              Ab               Eb          Bb      F     Ab  Eb 
 Look over there (where), there, there's a lady that I used to know
.Bb            F        Ab                 Eb      Bb   F   Ab  Eb
 She's married now or engaged or something so I am told

[C]
.Eb                  F        Bb
 Is she really going out with him
.Eb                  Dm       Gm   F   Eb
 Is she really gonna take him home tonight
.Eb                  F        Gm
 Is she really going out with him
.            Eb
 Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, 
.        F                            Bb F Ab Eb        Bb F Ab Eb
 There's something going wrong around here      (around here)

[V2]
 Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
 I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real sweet
 Look over there (where), there, 
 Here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
 They say that looks don't count for much and so there goes your proof

;CHORUS

[Mid 8]
.Dm                 Eb              F               Gm             Dm
 But if looks could kill, there's a man there who's marked down as dead
.Dm             Eb           F             Gm             Dm
 Cause I had my fill, listen you take your hands from her head 
.Dm       Eb               F      Gm        Eb  F  Eb  F   Bb F Ab Eb  Bb F Ab Eb
 I get so mean around this scene, Hey, baby 

;CHORUS

[OUTRO]
.Ab              Eb           Bb F  Ab              Eb           Bb     F
 Something going wrong around here, something going wrong around here
.Ab              Eb           Bb F  Ab              Eb                  Bb
 Something going wrong around here, something going wrong around..........</lyrics>

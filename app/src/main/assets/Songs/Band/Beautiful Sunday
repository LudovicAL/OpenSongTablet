  <title>Beautiful Sunday</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.C
 Sunday morning, up with the lark,
.
 I think I'll take a walk in the park
.F         G                     C
 Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day
.C
 I've got someone waiting for me, 
.
 When I see her I know that she'll say
.F         G                     C
 Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day

[C]
.C       C7            F
 Hi, hi, hi, beautiful Sunday, 
.        G                     C
 This is my, my, my, beautiful day
.         C         C7                D
 When you say, say, say, say that you love me, 
.    F       G                   C
 Oh, my, my, my it's a beautiful day

[V2]
 Birds are singing, you by my side,
 Let's take a car and go for a ride
 Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day
 We'll drive on and follow the sun, 
 Makin' Sunday go on and on
 Hey, hey, hey, it's a beautiful day</lyrics>

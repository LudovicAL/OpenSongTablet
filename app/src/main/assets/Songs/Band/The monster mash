  <title>The monster mash</title>
  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G    Em     C      D                (most of the way!)

[V1]
 I was working in the lab late one night
 When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
 For my monster from his slab did rise 
 And suddenly to my suprise

[C]
 (He did the mash)  He did the monster mash
 (The monster mash)  It was a graveyard smash
 (He did the mash)  It caught on in a flash
 (He did the mash)  He did the monster mash

[V2]
 From my laboratory in the castle east
 To the master's bedroom where the vampires feast
 The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
 To get a jolt from my electrodes             (They did..)

;CHORUS

[MID8]
.    C                               D
 The zombies all were having fun the party had just begun
.    C                         D
 The guests included Wolf man, Dracula and his son

[V3]
 The scene was rocking, all were digging the sounds
 Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
 The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
 With their vocal group 'The crypt kicker five'        (They did..)

;CHORUS

[V4]
 Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
 Seems he was troubled by just one thing
 He opened the lid and shook his fist
 And said 'whatever happened to my Transylvania mist?'  (They did..)

;CHORUS

[V5]
 Now everything's cool Drac's a part of the band
 And my monster mash is the hit of the land
 For you, the living, this mash was meant to
 When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you  (They did)

;CHORUS x2    (The monster mash!)</lyrics>

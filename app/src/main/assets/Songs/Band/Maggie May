.D  Em7      G        D   x2      G..

[V1]
.A                G                           D 
 Wake up Maggie I think I've got something to say to you
.     A                    G                D
 It's late September and I really should be back at school
.  G                D           G              A  
 I know I keep you amused But I feel I'm being used
.   Em                     F#m       Em     Asus A 
 Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
.    Em                 A            Em                   A
 You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
.    Em                  A                  D
 You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts 

[V2]
 The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
 But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
 I laughed at all your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax 
 Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more  
 You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone 
 You stole my soul that's a pain I can do without 

[V3]
 All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
 But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover you wore me out
 All you did was wreck my bed And in the morning kick me in the head  
 Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more  
 You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone 
 You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried  

[BREAK]
.Em     A      D      G             Em      G        D

[V4]
 I suppose I should collect my books and get back to school
 Or steal my daddy's cue make a living out of playing pool
 Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand 
 Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
 You made a first class fool out of me, but I'm as blind as a fool can be 
 You stole my heart but I love you anyway

[BREAK]
.Em     A      D      G             Em      G        D    x2

[OUTRO RIFF]

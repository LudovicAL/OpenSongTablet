  <title>Somewhere in my heart</title>
  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.C   C   G   G F (crack crack)

[V1]
.C
 Summer in the city where the air is still
 A baby being born to the overkill
.F 
 Who cares what people say, we walk down love's motorway
.  C
 Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
 And singing hearts and flowers

[C]
.F                                 E7 
 Somewhere in my heart, there is a star that shines for you
.F                       C 
 Silver splits the blue, love will see you through
.F                                   E7
 Somewhere in my heart, there is the will to set you free
.F                 Fm    C 
 All you've got to be is true  

[V2]
 Star above the city in the northern chill
 A baby being born to the overkill
 No say, no place to go, a T.V. and a radio
 Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
 And wearing hearts and flowers

;CHORUS

[Mid 8]
.G               C C G
 But who could heal, what's never been as one
.F                                                               E7 
 Our hearts have been torn since the day we were born, just like anyone
.Ab
 From Westwood to Hollywood, one thing that's understood
.            G7 
 Is that you can't buy time, but you can sell your soul
.        G7                                        (F) 
 And the closest thing to heaven is to rock n' roll

[GUITAR]
.F   C   F   E7

;CHORUS   x2

[OUTRO]
.F                 Fm    C
 All you've got to be is true</lyrics>

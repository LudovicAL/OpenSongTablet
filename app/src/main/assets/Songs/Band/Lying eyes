  <lyrics>[Intro]
.G    Gmaj7     C    Am   D    G   C  D

[V1]
.G               Gmaj7            C
 City girls just seem to find out early 
.Am                            D
 How to open doors with just a smile
.G                Gmaj7             C 	  
 Rich old man and she won't have to worry 
.       Am              D              G      C  D
 She'll dress up all in lace and go in style
.G                 Gmaj7              C      
 Late at night the big old house gets lonely,
.        Am                            D 
 I guess every point of refuge has its price
.       G                   Gmaj7             C    
 And it breaks her heart to think her love is only 
.      Am            D                G  C D
 Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

[V2]
 So she tells him she must go out for the evening 
 To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
 But he knows where she's going and she's leaving, 
 She is headed for the cheatin' side of town   

[C]
.          G  C            G  C  G
 You can't hide your lying eyes, 
.         Em Bm     	    Am  D
 And your smile has been disguised        	
.             G   Gmaj7    C  A 	        
 I thought by now you'd realise, 
.      Am              D              (G)   
 There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes        	               			

[Break]
.G  Gmaj7   C  Am  D  G  (C  D  To verse)

[V3]
 On the other side of town a boy is waiting,
 With fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
 She's drives on through the night anticipating; 
 'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel
 She rushes to his arms, they fall together, 
 She whispers and it's only for a while
 She swears that soon she'll be coming back forever, 
 She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

[C]

[V4]
 She gets up and pours herself a strong one 
 And stares out at the stars up in the sky
 Another night, it's gonna be a long one, 
 She draws the shades and hangs her head to cry
 She's wonders how it ever got this crazy, 
 She thinks about a boy she knew in school
 Did she get tired or did she just get lazy, 
 She's so far gone she feels just like a fool
 My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things, 
 You set it up so well, so carefully
 Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things, 
 You're still that same old girl you used to be
 
[C]

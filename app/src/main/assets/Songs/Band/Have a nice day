 Address unsure of but it turned out just right

 It started straight off "coming here is hell"
 That's his first words we asked what he meant
 He said "where ya from" we told him our lot
 When you take a holiday is this what you want

 Lie around all day, have a drink to chase
 Yourself and tourists yeah that's what I hate
 He said we're going wrong, we've all become the same
 We dress the same ways, only our accents change

 Swim in the ocean, that'd be my dish
 I drive around all day and kill processed fish
 It's all money gum, no artists anymore
 You're only in it now to make more, more, more

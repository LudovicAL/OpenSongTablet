  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.F   C/E   Bb   Gm7  C  

[V1]
.            F    C            Bb         Gm 
 The road is long, with many a winding turn 
.     C    C#dim  Dm7       Eb               Gm7 C 
 That leads us to who knows where, who knows where 
.        F       C                Dm7   Db 
 But I'm strong, strong enough to carry him 
.F               Gm7 C   F      Gm7   C 
 He ain't heavy, he's my brother 

[V2]
.         F  C               Bb      Gm 
 So on we go, his welfare is my concern 
.   C  C#dim7 Dm7   Eb              Gm7  C 
 No burden is he to bear, we'll get there 
.      F     C              Dm7    Db 
 For I know, he would not encumber me 
.F               Gm7 C   F       F7 
 He ain't heavy, he's my brother 

[Mid 8]
.       Bb       C7       Bb         C7 
 If I'm laden at all, I'm laden with sadness 
.     Am          Cm6   Bb    A7 
 That every one's heart isn't filled 
.         Dm7  F      Bb    G7 
 With the gladness of love 
.         Gm7     C7 
 For one another 

[V3]
.                  F     C                   Bb      Gm 
 It's a long, long road, from which there is no return 
.      C    C#dim7  Dm7    Eb             Gm7  C  
 While we're on our way to there, why not share 
.        F    C                Dm7     Db 
 And the load doesn't weigh me down at all 
.F          Gm7  C       F 
 He ain't heavy, he's my brother

 (PIANO ONLY)   

[V1]
.D         A/C#    D/F#                 A  Asus4  A
 Somethin' in your eyes, makes me wanna lose myself
.               G                    D     Asus4
 Makes me wanna lose myself, in your arms
.        D         A/C#    D/F#                       A  Asus4  A
 There's somethin' in your voice, makes my heart beat fast
.          G                             D     Asus4
 Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life
.       F#m      G         D/A  F#7/Bb Bm
 If you knew how lonely my life has    been
.        G         D        A Asus4 A
 And how long I've been so alone
.           F#m        G                 D/A  F#7/Bb  Bm
 And if you knew how I wanted someone to come along
.    G         D                   A Asus4 A
 And change my life the way you've done

[C]
.              D    Dsus4 D              A A/B  A/C#  D
 It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
.                  G   D/F#    Bm         E      Asus4   A
 It feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
.              D Dsus4 D                 A  A/B  A/C#  D
 It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me                                           
.                  G   D/F#    E          A    D     
 It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong    

[GUITAR]
.G   D/F#  E   A  D  Dsus4 D

[V2]
 A window breaks, down a long, dark street
 And a siren wails in the night
 But I'm alright, 'cause I have you here with me
 And I can almost see, through the dark there is light
 Well, if you knew how much this moment means to me
 And how long I've waited for your touch
 And if you knew how happy you are making me
 I never thought that I'd love anyone so much

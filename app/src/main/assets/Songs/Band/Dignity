  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.F9  (fade in)  F     F/A     Bb     C 

[V1]
.          F                 F/A    
 There's a man I meet, walks up our street
.       Bb                               C 
 He's a worker for the council, has been twenty years
.       F                          F/A 
 And he takes no lip of nobody and litter off the gutter
.   Bb                   C 
 He puts it in a bag and never thinks to mutter
.       F                    
 And he packs his lunch in a sunblest bag
.    F/A                               Bb 
 The children call him ‘bogey’, but he never lets on
.      C 
 But I know cause he once told me
.   F                              F/A 
 He let me know a secret about the money in his kitty
.     Bb                       C        Bb  C  F
 He's gonna buy a dingy, gonna call her dignity

[B]
.         Bb 			
 And I'll sail her up the west coast, 
.        C
 Through villages and towns
.Am                         Dm            	
 I'll be on my holidays and they'll be doing their rounds
.        Bb                              C	
 They'll ask me how I got her, I'll say, I saved my money
.             Am                     Bb   C/A    Bb/G  C  F (riff)
 They'll say, isn't she pretty, that ship called dignity

[V2]
.        F                        C/F 
 And I'm telling this story, in a far away scene
.Bb/F                  C/F 
 Sipping down raki and reading Maynard Keynes
.        F                        C/F 
 And I'm thinking about home, and all that that means
.      Bb/F                    C/F   (F  C/F  Bb/F  C/F)
 And a place in the winter for dignity

[C]

[PIANO BREAK]
.F  C/F  Bb/F  C/F etc.   to end

[V3]
 Set it up, set it up, set it up, set it up, set it up, set it up
 Set it up again, set it up again, set it up again, set it up again	
 													x2
 And I'm thinking about home 
 And I'm thinking about faith 
 And I'm thinking about work 
 And I'm thinking how good it would be to be here someday
 On a ship called dignity, on a ship call dignity,  
 On a ship called dignity, that ship</lyrics>

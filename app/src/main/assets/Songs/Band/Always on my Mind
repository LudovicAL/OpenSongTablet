  <lyrics>[Intro]
.G    D/F#    Em    Em/D    C    D
 
[V1]
.G              D/F#      Em             Em/D C         D
 Maybe I didn't love you, quite as often as I could have
.G              D/F#       Em       Em/D      A/C#  A7
 Maybe I didn't treat you, quite as good as I should have
.C                  G/B          C        G/B         Am  Dsus4 D
 If I made you feel second best, girl I'm sorry I was blind
.D        Em     D/F#  G     C        D            G   Am D
 You were always on my mind, You were always on my mind

[V2]
.G                 D/F#      Em        Em/D           C    D
 Maybe    I didn't hold you, all those lonely, lonely times
.G                    D/F#      Em     Em/D              A/C# A7
 And I  guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine
.C                            G/B            C      G/B            Am  Dsus4 D
 Little_ things I should have said and done, I just never took the time
.D         Em     D/F#  G     C        D            G   Am D
 You we_re always on my mind, You were always on my mind

[Bridge]
.G D/F# Em Em/D C                 G/B               Am  Dsus4 D
 Te--ll me,     tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
.    G D/F# Em Em/D C                           G/B           Am   D      G....
 And give-- me,     give me one more chance, to keep you satisfied,  satisfied....

[Instrumental]

 Little things I should have, said and done, I just never took the time
.D        Em     D/F#  G     C        D            G
 You were always on my mind, You were always on my mind
.D        Em     D/F#  G     C        D            G
 You were always on my mind, You were always on my mind</lyrics>

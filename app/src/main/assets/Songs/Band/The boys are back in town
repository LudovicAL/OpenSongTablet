  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.A  Bm7  D   A  Bm7  D

.A                  C#m7
 Guess who just got back today
.D                            F#m
 Them wild eyed boys that had been away
.C#m                     F#m
 Haven't changed, hadn't much to say
.    D                      E
 But man I still think them cats are crazy
.A                   C#m7
 They were asking if you were around
.D                      F#m
 How you was, where you could be found
.C#m                         F#m
 I told them you were living downtown
.D                       E
 Driving all the old men crazy

.    A                     Bm7   D
 The boys are back in town (echo)
 I said the boys are back in town (echo)
 The boys are back in town (echo)
 The boys are back in town (echo)

[V2]
 You know that chick that used to dance a lot
 Ev'ry night she'd be on the floor shakin' what she'd got
 Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot
 I mean she was steamin
 And at that time over at Johnny's place
 Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
 Man, we just fell about the place
 If that chick don't wanna know, forget her.

[Mid 8]
.           C#m7    F#m  Bm7                 E   F#m
 Spread the word around, guess who's back in town
.                C#m7  F#m  Bm7       E   F#m
 Just spread the word 

[V3]
 Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
 Down at Dino's bar and grill
 The drink will flow and the blood will spill
 And if the boys wanna fight you better let 'em
 That jukebox in the corner blasting out my fav'rite song
 The nights are getting warmer, it won't be long
 Won't be long till summer comes
 Now that the boys are here again

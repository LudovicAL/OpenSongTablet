  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.(F#) E guitar..... (I am iron man....)

[MAIN RIFF]
.Bm D D Em ' (Gm F#m) D  D Em '

[V1]
 Has he lost his mind, can he see or is he blind?
 Can he walk at all, and if he moves will he fall?

[RIFF x1]

[V2]
 Is he live or dead, has he thoughts within his head?
 We'll just pass him there, why should we even care?
 
[BREAK]
.Bm   A   x 3 then break 4th time
 
[MAIN RIFF x2]

[V2]
 He was turned to steel in the great magnetic field
 When he travelled time for the future of mankind
.Em                D                     Bm (riff 2)
 Nobody wants him, he just stares at the world
.Em                      D                 Bm (riff 2)
 Planning his vengeance, that he will soon unfold

[MAIN RIFF x2]

[V3]
 Now the time is near for Iron man to spread fear
 Vengeance from the grave, kills the people he once saved
 Nobody wants him, they just turn their heads
 Nobody helps him, now he has his revenge
 
[BREAK]
.C#m climb down riff x2
 
[GUITAR]
.C#m x 8 bars
 
;Bm riff 2
 
[MAIN RIFF x2]

[V4]
 Heavy boots of lead, fills his victims full of dread
 Running as fast as they can, iron man lives again
 
[BREAK]
.Bm   A   x 2</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.A   C   G x2

[V1]
.A                    C           G
 Travelling through a tunnel undersea
.A                                       C                     G
 You never know it cracks in half you’re never ever ever gonna see me

[C]
.D           C                  G
 But you can have it all if you like
.D               C          G
 You can have it all if you like
.                                        A C G  A C G
 And you can pay for it the rest of your life   Life

[V2]
 I wouldn’t believe your wireless radio
 If I had myself a flying giraffe you’d have one in a box with a window
 But you can have it all if you like
 You can have it all if you like
 And you can pay for it the rest of your life.............Life

[GUITAR]
.D   C   G  x2

[Mid 8]
.Em          A               Em
 Life in the summer’s on its back
.Em         A                    Em
 I have to agree that that’s the crack
.Em               A                   G
 So take what you want I’m not coming back

[C2]
.D                  C          G ..........
 So you can have it all if you like
 You can have it all if you like
 You can have it all if you like
 You can have it all if you like
 And you can pay for it the rest of your life
.A C G .....
 Life   Life   Life

  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bm     E7               Amaj7
 Sunday morning, rain is falling,
.Bm         E7                 Amaj7
 Steal some covers, share some skin.
.Bm         E7              Amaj7
 Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable,
.    Bm               E7              Amaj7
 You twist to fit the mould that I am in.

[V2]
 But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do,
 And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew,
 That someday it would lead me back to you,
 That someday it would lead me back to you.

[C]
.            Bm  E7 Amaj7                    Bm  E7 Amaj7
 That may be all I  need, in darkness she is all I  see.
.                   Bm    E7   Amaj7
 Come and rest your bones with me.
.                       Bm            E7            Amaj7
 Driving slow on Sunday morning and I never want to leave.

[V3]
 Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah, yeah,
 Paint a picture with my hands.
 Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm,
 Change the weather, still together when it ends.

[V4]
 But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do,
 Sunday morning, rain is falling, and I'm calling out to you.
 Singing someday it'll bring me back to you,
 Find a way to bring myself back home to you.</lyrics>

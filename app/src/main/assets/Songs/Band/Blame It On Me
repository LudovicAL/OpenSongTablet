.Eb  Eb4
 
[V1]
.Eb             Eb4            Eb             Eb4
 The garden was blessed by the gods of me and you
.Eb       Eb4          Eb                  Eb4
 We headed west for to find ourselves some truth
.  Cm                 Ab                        Eb  Eb4 Eb Eb4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for

[V2]
.   Eb              Eb4        Eb            Eb4
 We counted all our reasons, excuses that we made
.   Eb                   Eb4          Eb           Eb4
 We found ourselves some treasure and threw it all away
.  Cm                 Ab                        Eb  Eb4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
.  Cm                 Ab                        Bb4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
 
[C]
.Bb4             Ab                          Eb                Bb4
   When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down, blame it on me
.Bb4              Ab                      Eb                Bb4
   When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
.Cm               Ab                        Eb  Eb4 Eb Eb4    
 What you waiting for, now what you waiting for
 
[V3]
.Eb                    Eb4             Eb          Eb4
 Caught in the tide of blossom, caught in the carnival
.Eb                 Eb4       Eb              Eb4
 Your confidence forgotten, I see the gypsies run
.  Cm                 Ab                        Eb
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
.  Cm                 Ab                        Bb4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for

[C2]
.Bb4             Ab                          Eb                Bb4
   When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down, blame it on me
.Bb4              Ab                      Eb                Bb4
   When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
.Cm                   Ab                        Eb 
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
.Cm                   Ab                        Bb4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
 
[C3]
.Bb4             Ab                          Eb                Bb4
   When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down, blame it on me
.Bb4              Ab                      Eb                Bb4
   When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
.Bb4             Ab                 Eb              Bb4
   When I dance alone, I know, I'll go, blame it on me
.Bb4              Ab                 Eb              Bb4
   When I lose control, I know, I'll go, blame it on me
.  Cm                 Ab                        Eb
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
.  Cm                 Ab                        Bb4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for

[V1]
.C             C4            C             C4
 The garden was blessed by the gods of me and you
.C       C4          C                  C4
 We headed west for to find ourselves some truth
.  Am                 F                        C  C4 C C4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for

[V2]
.   C              C4        C            C4
 We counted all our reasons, excuses that we made
.   C                   C4          C           C4
 We found ourselves some treasure and threw it all away
.  Am                 F                        C  C4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
.  Am                 F                        G4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for

.G4             F                          C                G4
   When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down, blame it on me
.G4              F                      C                G4
   When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
.Am               F                        C  C4 C C4    
 What you waiting for, now what you waiting for
 
[V3]
.C                    C4             C          C4
 Caught in the tide of blossom, caught in the carnival
.C                 C4       C              C4
 Your confidence forgotten, I see the gypsies run
.  Am                 F                        C
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
.  Am                 F                        G4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for

[C2]
.G4             F                          C                G4
   When I dance alone and the sun's bleeding down, blame it on me
.G4              F                      C                G4
   When I lose control and the veil's overused, blame it on me
.Am                   F                        C 
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
.Am                   F                        G4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for

.G4             F                 C              G4
   When I dance alone, I know, I'll go, blame it on me
.G4              F                 C              G4
   When I lose control, I know, I'll go, blame it on me
.  Am                 F                        C
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for
.  Am                 F                        G4
 Oh, what you waiting for, now what you waiting for

[V2]
 If the sky above you should turn dark and full of clouds
 And that old north wind should begin to blow
 Keep your head together and call my name out loud
 And soon I will be knocking upon your door.
 You just call out my name and you know where ever I am
 I’ll come running to see you again.
 Winter, spring, summer or fall all you got to do is call
 And I’ll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[B]
.     C                          G                     D

 They’ll hurt you and desert you. Well they’ll take your soul if you let them.
.             A7sus4     A7
 Oh yeah, but don’t you let them.

[C2]
 You just call out my name and you know wherever I am
 I’ll come running to see you again.
 Oh babe, don’t you know that, Winter spring summer or fall,
 Hey now, all you’ve got to do is call.
 Lord, I’ll be there, yes I will. You’ve got a friend.
 You’ve got a friend.
 Ain’t it good to know you’ve got a friend.
 Ain’t it good to know you’ve got a friend.
 You’ve got a friend.</lyrics>

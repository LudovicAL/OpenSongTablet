  <title>Romeo and Juliet</title>
  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.F    C/E  Bb C/E  x2

[V1]
.F              C/E Dm                C/E
 A lovestruck romeo sings a streetsus serenade
.F                C/E Dm              Bb
 Laying everybody low with a lovesong that he made
.C                Bb C                F
 Finds a streetlight steps out of the shade 
.                    Bb                   C
 Says something like you and me babe how about it ? 

[V2]
 Juliet says hey its Romeo you nearly gimme a heart attack
 He's underneath the window
 She's singing hey la my boyfriends back
 You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
 Anyway what you gonna do about it ? 

[C]
.    F  C             Dm              Bb
 Juliet the dice were loaded from the start
.      F   C         Dm           Bb
 And I bet and you exploded in my heart
.    C    F        Bb  Dm        Bb
 And I forget I forget the movie song
.Gm                                 
 When you wanna realise 
.       Bb                     Dm   C F    (riff)
 It was just that the time was wrong juliet ? 

[V3]
 Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame
 Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same
 And I dreamed your dream for you and your dream is real
 How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

[V4]
 Where you can fall for chains of silver
 You can fall for chains of gold
 You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
 You promised me everything you promised me think and thin
 Now you just says oh Romeo yeah
 You know I used to have a scene with him

[C2]
 Juliet when we made love you used to cry
 You said I love you like the stars above Ill love you till I die
 Theres a place for us you know the movie song
 When you gonna realise 
 It was just that the time was wrong juliet ? 

[V5]
 I cant do the talk like they talk on TV
 And I cant do a love song like the way its meant to be
 I cant do everything but Id do anything for you
 I cant do anything except be in love with you

[V6]
 And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
 All do is keep the beat and bad company
 All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
 Julie Id do the stars with you any time

[C3]
 Juliet when we made love you used to cry
 You said I love you like the stars above Ill love you till I die
 Theres a place for us you know the movie song
 When you gonna realise 
 It was just that the time was wrong juliet ? 

[V7]
 A lovestruck romeo sings a streetsus serenade
 Laying everybody low with me a lovesong that he made
 Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade
 Says something like you and me babe how about it ?</lyrics>

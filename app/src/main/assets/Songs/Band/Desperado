.G   G7   C   Cm   G

[V1]
.     G   G7              C            Cm
 Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
.            G   D/F#  Em          A7      D7  
 You've been out riding fences for so long now
.            G	    G7             C               Cm 
 Oh you're a hard one, I know that you've got your reasons
.      G           B7  Em               Am7      D   G   D/F#
 These things that are pleasing you can hurt you somehow
.          Em                         D 
 Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
.       C                 G    D/F#
 She'll beat you if she's able
.             Em                 C                G    D/F#
 You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
.       Em               D
 Now it seems to me some fine things
.          C              G    D/F#
 Have been laid upon your table
.        Em            A7                  D D7
 But you only want the ones that you can't get

[V2]
 Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger  
 Your pain and your hunger, they're driving you home
 And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin
 Your prison is walking through this world all alone
 Don't your feet get cold in the winter time
 The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
 It's hard to tell the night time from the day
 You're losing all your highs and lows
 Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away

[V3]
 Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
 Come down from your fences and open the gate                                 	
 It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
.           G      D/F#  Em         C       G/B  Am 
 You better let somebody love you  (let somebody love you)
.           G       B7   Em        Am                (G)
 You better let somebody love you, before it's too late

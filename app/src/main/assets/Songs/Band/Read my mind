  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.C   G   C   G        

[V1] 
.C                C/A  C/E     Gsus4                     G
 On the corner of main street, Just tryin' to keep it in line
.C                      C/A C/E Gsus4                 G 
 You say you wanna move on  and you say I'm falling behind
.                C  C/A  C/E  Gsus4  G               C  C/A  C/E  Gsus4 G        
 Can you read my mind?               Can you read my mind?         

[V2]
 I never really gave up on breakin' out of this two-star town
 I got the green light, I got a little fight, I'm gonna turn this thing around
 Can you read my mind?       Can you read my mind?

[C]
.             F                C                 G      
 The good old days, the honest man, The restless heart, the promised land
.         F                C              G
 A subtle kiss that no one sees, a broken wrist and a big trapeze
.                F                 C                 G        G#dim7    Am
 Oh well I don't mind if you don't mind, coz I don't shine if you don't shine
.           F  (2x)                 G   (2x)
 Before you go,     can you read my mind?

[V3]
 It’s funny how you just break down waitin' on some sign
 I pull up to the front of your driveway, with magic soakin' my spine
 Can you read my mind?       Can you read my mind?

[C2]
 The teenage queen, the loaded gun, the drop dead dream, the chosen one
 A southern drawl, a world unseen, a city wall and a trampoline
 Oh well I don't mind if you don't mind, coz I don't shine if you don't shine
 Before you jump,    tell me what you find    when you read my mind

[Guitar]
.Am  G  F   C  Am  G  F  G  G  G      G

[C3]
.               F             C              G
 Slippin’ in my faith until I fall, he never returned that call
.                F                  C              G
 Woman, open the door, don't let it sting, I wanna breathe that fire again,   
.                 Am                 G                   F                  C
 She said I don't mind, if you don't mind, cause I don't shine if you don't shine
.                 Am                    G                    F   F
 Put your back on me,  put your back on me, put your back on me

[Break]
.C                      C/A  C/E Gsus4  G
 
[Outro]
.C                          C/A   C/E      Gsus4   G      
 The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun
.                 C  C/A C/E Gsus4  G     C  C/A  C/E Gsus4  G  C

  <title>Superstition</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.          Ebm
 Very superstitious, writing's on the wall,
 Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall,
.               Ebm (riff)
 Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
 Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past.
.           Bb7      B7              Bb7        Bb7/A
 When you believe in things that you don't understand,
.         Ab7     (Bb7)                   Ebm
 Then you suffer,  superstition ain't the way

[V2] 
 Very superstitious, wash your face and hands,
 Rid me of the problem, do all that you can, 
 Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong,
 You don't wanna save me, sad is my song.
 When you believe in things that you don't understand,
 Then you suffer, superstition ain't the way, yeh, yeh.

[Break]
.Bb7   B7    Bb7   Bb7/A    Ab7     (Bb7)     Ebm

[V3]
 Very superstitious, nothin' more to say,
 Very superstitious, the devil's on his way,
 Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass,
 Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past
 When you believe in things that you don't understand,
 Then you suffer, superstition ain't the way, no, no, no</lyrics>

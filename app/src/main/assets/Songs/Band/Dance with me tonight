[V2]
 We're getting sweaty, hot and heavy in the crowd now,
 Loosen up and let you hands go down, down,
 Go with it girl, yeah just close your eyes, yeah.
 I feel the music moving through your body,
 Looking at you I can tell you want me,
 Don't stop keep going till the morning light, yeah.

 When I saw you there, 
.Bm
 Sitting all alone in the dark acting like you didn't 
.G              A......          A......
 Have a care, I knew right then, you'd be mine
.A
 We'd be dancing the whole damn night right

 Break it down now.....

  <lyrics>[V1]
 The best things in life are free
 But you can give them to the birds and bees
 I want money, that's what I want
 That's what I want, Oh yeah.
 
[V2]
 You're love give me such a thrill
 But you're loving don't pay my bill,
 I want money, that's what I want
 That's what I want, Oh yeah.
 
;SOLO
 
[V3]
 Money don't get everything it's true
 But what it don't get, I can't use
 I want money, that's what I want
 That's what I want, Oh yeah.
 
[T]
 I want money, gimme some money
 I need money, just gimme money
 That's what I want, Oh yeah

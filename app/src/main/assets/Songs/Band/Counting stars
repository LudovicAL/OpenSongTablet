  <lyrics>[C]
.C#m               E                       B                              A
 Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep, dreaming about the things that we could be
.    C#m              E                       B                                              
 But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard, said no more counting dollars
.A
 We'll be counting stars, yeah, we'll be counting â€¦...   stars

[V1]
 I see this life like a swinging vine, swing my heart across the line
 In my face is flashing signs, seek it out and ye shall find
 Old, but I'm not that old, young, but I'm not that bold
 And I don't think the world is sold, I'm just doing what we're told

[P]
 I feel something so right, by doing the wrong thing
 And I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
.A                                 ......
 I could lie, could lie, could lie        Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

[C]
 Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
 Dreaming about the things that we could be
 But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
 Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
 Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
 Dreaming about the things that we could be
 But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
 Said no more counting dollars, we'll be, we'll be counting stars

[V2]
 I feel the love and I feel it burn, down this river every turn
 Hope is our four letter word, make that money, watch it burn
 Old, but I'm not that old, young, but I'm not that bold
 And I don't think the world is sold, I'm just doing what we're told

[P2]
 And I feel something so wrong, by doing the right thing
 I could lie, could lie, could lie
 Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

;CHORUS
 
[BRIDGE]
 Take that money, watch it burn, sing in the river, the lessons I learned    x4
 Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

;CHORUS
;BRIDGE TO END</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[Intro:]
.E | C#m | B | A
 
 
[V1]
.           E                C#m
 Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
.             B                          A 
 But it's the only thing that I know
.             E                         C#m
 When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
.          B                                 A
 It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
 
[P]
.C#m                      A
 We keep this love in a photograph
.E                       B
 We make these memories for ourselves
.          C#m           
 Where our eyes are never closing
.     A
 Our hearts were never broken
.     E                         B
 And times forever frozen still
 
[C]
.           E
 So you can keep me inside the pocket of your
.B
 Ripped jeans holding me closer till our
.C#m                             A
 Eyes meet, you won't ever be alone
.                         E
 Wait for me to come home
 
 
[V2]
.           E                C#m
 Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
.             B                      A
 And it's the only thing that I know
.                    E                          C#m
 I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
.             B                                   A
 It is the only thing we take with us when we die
 
[P]
.C#m                      A
 We keep this love in a photograph
.E                       B
 We make these memories for ourselves
.          C#m           
 Where our eyes are never closing
.     A
 Our hearts were never broken
.     E                      B
 And times forever frozen still
 
 
[C]
.           E
 So you can keep me inside the pocket of your
.B
 Ripped jeans holding me closer till our
.C#m                               A
 Eyes meet, you won't ever be alone
 
[B]
.           E
 And if you hurt me that's ok baby, we'll be
.B 
 Words deep inside these pages you just
.C#m                              A
 Hold me and I won't ever let you go
 
.                     C#m
 Wait for me to come home
.                     A       
 Wait for me to come home
.                     E
 Wait for me to come home
.                     B
 Wait for me to come home

[C2]
.           E                               
 Oh you can fit me inside the necklace you got when you were
.B           
 16 next to your heartbeat where I 
.C#m                                    A
 Should be, keep it deep within your soul
.           E
 And if you hurt me that's ok baby only 
.B 
 words bleed inside these pages you just
.C#m                              A
 Hold me and I won't ever let you go
.          E                 
 When I'm away I will remember how you
.B                                      C#m
 Kissed me under the lamp post back on sixth street 
.                                 A
 Hearing you whisper through the phone
.B
 Wait for me to come home

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G    Em    C     D7

[V1]
.    G                                  Bm
 I remember when rock was young, me and Suzie had so much fun
.        C
 Holding hands and skimming stones,
.       D7
 Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
.        G
 But the biggest kick I ever got,
.            Bm
 Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
.          C
 While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
.        D7
 We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[C]
.     Em
 Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
.          A7
 When your feet just can't keep still
.D7                                  G
 I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
.Em
 Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
.     A7
 When Suzie wore her dresses tight
.D7                                   F/C  C  F/C  C
 And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Break]
.G            Em           C            D7
 La, lalalala la, lalalala la, lalalala la

[V2]
 But the years went by and the rock just died,
 Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
 Long nights crying by the record machine
 Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
 But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
 Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
 Learning fast as the weeks went past
 We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last</lyrics></song>

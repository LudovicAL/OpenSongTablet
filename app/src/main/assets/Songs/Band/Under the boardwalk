.            F                                          C
 Oh when the sun beats down and melts the tar up on the roof
.        C7 
 And the street gets so hot 
.                 F                F7 
 You'll wish your tired feet were fire proof               
.          Bb                     F    Dm
 Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah!
.     F               C                      F 
 On a blanket with my baby that's where I'll be

[C]
.          Dm 
 Under the boardwalk, out of the sun
.          C 
 Under the boardwalk, we'll be having some fun
.          Dm 
 Under the boardwalk, people walking above
.          C
 Under the boardwalk, we'll be falling in love
.          Dm
 Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

[V2]
 Now from the sands you hear the happy sounds of a carousel
 You can almost taste the hot dogs and French fries they sell
 Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah!
 On a blanket with my baby that's where I'll be

[C]

.          Bb                     F     Dm 
 Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah!
.     F               C                      F 
 On a blanket with my baby that's where I'll be

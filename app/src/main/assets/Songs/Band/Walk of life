  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E   A   B    A B   x 5  

[V1]
.E 
 Here comes Johnie singing oldies, goldies 
 Be-bop-a-luba baby what I say 
 Here comes Johnie singing I got a woman 
 Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay 
.A                                     E 
 He got the action, he got the motion, well the boy can play 
.A                     E  
 Dedication, devotion, turning all the nightime into the day 

[C]
.          E                           B 
 He do the song about the sweet loving woman 
.          E              A 
 He do the song about the knife 
.          E     B                 A 
 He do the walk, he do the walk of life 
.      B                (E   A   B    A  B) x2 
 Yeah, he do the walk of life 

[V2]
 Here comes Johnie, gonna tell me a story 
 Hand me down my walking shoes 
 Here comes Johnie with the power and the glory 
 Back beat, we're talking blues 
 He got the action, he got the motion, well theboy can play 
 Dedication, devotion, turning all the nightime into the day 

;CHORUS

;VERSE 1 

[C2]
 And after all the violence and double talk 
 It's just a song about the trouble and the strife 
 He do the walk, he do the walk of life 
 Yeah, he do the walk of life

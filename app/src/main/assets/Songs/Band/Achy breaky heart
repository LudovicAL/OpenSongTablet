  <lyrics>[V1]
.A 
 You can tell the world, you never was my girl 
.                                    E   
 You can burn my clothes up when I'm gone 
.            
 Oh, you can tell your friends, just what a fool I've been 
.                                   A 
 And laugh and joke about me on the phone 

[V2]
 You can tell my arms, go back onto the farm 
 You can tell my feet to hit the floor 
 Oh, you can tell my lips to tell my finger tips 
 They won't be reaching out for you no more 

[C]
.    A
 But don't tell my heart, my achy-breaky heart 
.                             E 
 I just don't think he'd understand 
.
 And if you tell my heart, my achy-breaky heart 
.                               A 
 He might blow up and kill this man, oooohhh! 

[GUITAR BREAK]
;(As Verse)

[V3]
 You can tell your maw, I moved to Arkansaw 
 You can tell your dog to bite my leg 
 Or tell your brother Cliff, whose fist can tell my lip 
 He never really liked me anyway 

[V4]
 Or tell your aunt Louise, tell anything you please 
 Myself already knows I'm not O.K. 
 Oh you can tell my eyes, to watch out for my mind 
 It might be walking out on me today 

[C]

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E   B   C#m   A
.E   B   G#m   A    (and for verse)

[V1]
 Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world
 She took the midnight train, goin' anywhere
 Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
 He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

;BREAK as INTRO x2 WITH GUITAR

[V2]
 A singer in a smokey room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume
 For a smile they can share the night, 
 It goes on and on and on and on
 
[C]
.A                  E
 Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
.      A                        E
 Their shadows searching in the night
.A                     E
 Streetlights, people, livin' just to find emotion
.A                       B   E   B   A
 Hidin' somewhere in the night

;BREAK as INTRO

[V3]
 Workin' hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill
 Payin' anything to roll the dice, just one more time
 Some will win, some will lose, some are born to sing the blues
 Oh, the movie never ends, it goes on and on and on and on

;Chorus

;INSTRUMENTAL AS INTRO

[Outro]
 Don't stop believin', hold on to that feelin'
 Streetlights, people,        x4
 Don't stop....</lyrics>

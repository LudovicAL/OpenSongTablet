.                C                              Cmaj7
 You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off you.
.              C7                       F/C
 You'd be like Heaven to touch, I wanna hold you so much.
.             Fm/C                          C
 At long last love has arrived, and I thank God I'm alive.
.                D/C        Fm/C                C
 You're just too good to be true, Can't take my eyes off you.

[V2]
 Please pardon the way that I stare, there's nothing else to compare.
 The sight of you leaves me weak, there are no words left to speak
 But if you feel like I feel, please let me know that it's real.
 You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off you.

 I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright,
.            Em              Am7
 I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night.
.            Dm7   G7                 C    A7
 I love you, baby, trust in me when I say:

.           Dm7                  G
 Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray,
.           Em               Am7
 Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay

.           Dm7                    Bb7.....
 And let me love you, baby, Let me love you.</lyrics></song>

.Amaj7   F#m    Bm    Bm (add Bb)   Bm7   E7  x2

[V1]
.Am                       G
 From the mountain tops down to the sunny street,
.G13                            F        E7
 A different drum is playing a different kind of beat.
.Am                   G
 It's like a mystery that never ends,
.Ebdim         F#dim      Adim               E7
 I see you crying and I want to kill your friends.

[C]
.Ama7                           F#m
 I hear your footsteps in the street,
.                           Bm  Bmaug
 It won't be long before we meet,
.  Bm7    E7
 It's obvious.
.Ama7                           Fm
 Just count me in and count me out and
.                         Bm  Bmaug
 I'll be waiting for the shout,
.Bm7      E7
 Oblivious...

[V2]
.Am                      G
 Met Mo and she's okay, said no one really changed,
.G13                            F                  E7
 Got different badges but they wear them just the same.
.Am                       G                Ebdim      F#dim
 But down by the ballroom I recognized that flaming fountain
.          Adim           E7       
 In those kindred caring eyes.
 
[C]
.Ama7                           F#m
 I hear your footsteps in the street,
.                          Bm  Bmaug
 It won't be long before we meet,
.  Bm7    E7
 It's obvious.
.Ama7                           Fm
 Just count me in and count me out and
.                        Bm  Bmaug
 I'll be waiting for the shout,
.Bm7      E7
 Oblivious...
 
[Mid 8]
.  Fma7                         Cma7
 I hope it haunts me 'til I'm hopeless,
.Gma7                        Dma7
 I hope it hits you when you go,
.Ama7                          Bma7
 And sometimes on the edge of sleeping
.F                      E7
 It rises up to let me know it's not so deep,
.             Ama7 (begin the entire Chorus part with guitar solo over it)
 I'm not so slow.
 
[C]
.Ama7                           F#m
 I hear your footsteps in the street,
.                           Bm  Bmaug
 It won't be long before we meet,
.  Bm7    E7
 It's obvious.
.Ama7                           Fm
 Just count me in and count me out and
.                         Bm  Bmaug
 I'll be waiting for the shout,
.Bm7      E7
 Oblivious...

[V3]
.Am                               G
 They're calling all the shots, they'll call and say they phoned,
.G13                                 F          E7
 They'll call us lonely when we're really just alone.
.Am                    G
 And like a funny film, it's kinda cute
.        Ebdim      F#dim               Adim           E7
 They've bought the bullets and there's no one left to shoot.
 
[C]
.Ama7                           F#m
 I hear your footsteps in the street,
.                           Bm  Bmaug
 It won't be long before we meet,
.  Bm7    E7
 It's obvious.
.Ama7                           Fm
 Just count me in and count me out and
                          Bm  Bmaug
 I'll be waiting for the shout,
.Bm7      E7
 Oblivious...      x2

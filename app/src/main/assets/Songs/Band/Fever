[V1]
 Never know how much I love you woman, never know how much I care
 When you put your arms around me, I get a feeling that is hard to bear

[C]
 You give me fever, say you give me fever
 Fever, in the morning child, you give me fever all through the night

[V2]
 Bless my soul, I love you, take this little heart of mine
 When you get me woman like you got me, I just have to drink my wine 

[V3]
 Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
 My eyes light up when you call my name, cause I know you're gonna treat me right

[V4]
 Everybody's got the fever, that is something you should know
 Fever isn't such a new scene, fever started long ago</lyrics>

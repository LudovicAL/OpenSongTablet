  <lyrics>[V1]
.Ab                       Eb
 Everytime our eyes meet, this feeling inside me 
.Fm                        Db
 Is almost more than I can take
.Ab                     Eb  
 Baby when you touch me I can feel how much you love me 
.Fm                    Db
 And it just blows me away 
.B                             Gb
 I've never been this close to anyone or anything 
.Abm                       E
 I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreams 

[C]
.Db                               Ab         
 I don't know how you do what you do, 
.                    Bbm                       Gb
 I'm so in love with you it just keeps getting better
.Db                           Ab         
 I wanna spend the rest of my life 
.               Bbm              Gb
 With you by my side forever and ever 
.E                           Gb                     Ab
 Every little thing that you do, baby I'm amazed by you 

[V2]
 The smell of your skin, the taste of your kiss
 The way you whisper in the dark 
 Your hair all around me, baby you surround me 
 You touch everyplace in my heart 
 Oh, it feels the first time every time 
 I wanna spent the whole night in your eyes 

;Chorus

[Break / Guitar]
.(Ab)    B   Db      Ab       B       Gb    Db
  
[C]
.Db (stop)    Gb             Ab
 Every little thing that you do
.                    Bbm                        Gb 
 I'm so in love with you, it just keeps getting better
.Db                           Ab
 I wanna spend the rest of my life 
.               Bbm              Gb
 With you by my side forever and ever 
.E                           Gb
 Every little thing that you do
.    E/Ab                        Gb/Bb Gb/Ab Gb
 Oh, every little thing that you do
.                   Ab 
 Baby I'm amazed by you</lyrics>

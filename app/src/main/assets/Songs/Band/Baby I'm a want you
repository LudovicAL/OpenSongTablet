[V1]
.A                    Bm7/A 
 Baby I'm a want you, baby I'm a need you 
.           A                         D 
 You're the only one I care enough to hurt about 
.Bm                       D                   E 
 Maybe I'm a crazy, but I just can't live without 
.     A                     Bm7/A 
 Your loving and affection, giving me direction 
.       A                                   D 
 Like a guiding light to help me through my darkest hour 
.Bm                                    D           E         A

.C#m                                  D 
 Used to be my life was just emotions passing by 
.C#m                                    D         
 Feeling all the while and never really knowing why

.Bm                                    D           E         A 
 Lately I've been praying, that you'll always be a staying beside me

[C2]
.C#m                                  D 
 Used to be my life was just emotions passing by

 Then you came along and made me laugh 
.    D                 Amaj7     Bm7 
 And made me cry , you taught me why

;REPEAT FROM BEGINNING

  <lyrics>[V1]
.E               A               D
 You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
.E          A                 D
 Lit up the world as I fell asleep
.E                      A        D
 'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
.E                       A                  D
 You'd think me rude but I'd just stand and stare
 
[C]
.D           A/C#        E
 I'd like to make myself believe
.            D     A     E/G#    D
 That planet Earth turns slowly
.D                     A                D         E      F#m
 It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
.       D             A/C#        B
 'Cause everything is never as it seems
 
[V2]
 'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
 As they tried to teach me how to dance
 A foxtrot above my head, a sockhop beneath my bed
 A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[C2]
.D              F#m         E
 I'd like to make myself believe
.            D     A     C#m    D
 that planet Earth turns slowly
.        D               A            D      E      F#m
 Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
.D                   A             E
 'Cause everything is never as it seems
.           D
 When i fall asleep
 
 G-C-F--
 leave my door open just a crack
 (please take me away from here)
 'Cause i feel like such an insomniac
 (please take me away from here)
 why do i tire of counting sheep
 (please take me away from here)
 when I'm far too tired to fall asleep
 
 To ten million fireflies
 I'm weird 'cause i hate goodbyes
 i got misty eyes as they said farewell
 but ill know where several are
 if my dreams get real bizarre
 'cause i saved a few and i keep them in a jar
 
 
.D              F#m         E
 I'd like to make myself believe
.            D     A     C#m    D
 that planet Earth turns slowly
.        D               A            D      E      F#m
 Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
.D                   A             B
 'Cause everything is never as it seems
.           D
 When i fall asleep
 
.D              F#m         E
 I'd like to make myself believe
.            D     A     C#m    D
 that planet Earth turns slowly
.        D               A            D      E      F#m
 Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
.D                   A             E
 'Cause everything is never as it seems
.           D
 When i fall asleep
 
.D              F#m         E
 I'd like to make myself believe
.            D     A     C#m    D
 that planet Earth turns slowly
.        D               A            D      E      F#m
 Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
.D                   A                 E
 Because my dreams are bursting at the seams...

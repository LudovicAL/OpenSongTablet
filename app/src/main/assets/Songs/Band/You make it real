  <lyrics>[Intro]
.Am   G    F C  x2

[V1]
.                C            Am
 There's so much craziness surrounding me
.                F                G
 There's so much going on it gets hard to breathe
.     G#dim7 F                           C
 When all my faith has gone you bring it back to me, 
.Am          G        F  C
 You make it real for me

[V2]
 Now I'm not sure of my priorities
 When I've lost sight of where I meant to be
 Like holy water washing over me, you make it real for me

[C]
.    G   Am F              C
 And I...'m running to you baby
.G   Am         F            C
 Yo...u are the only one who saved me
.       G    Am   F                C
 That's wh...y've been missing you lately
.      Am          G        F   C
 Cause you make it real for me 

[V3]
 When my head is strong but my heart is weak
 I'm full of arrogance and uncertainty
 When I can't find the words you teach my heart to speak
 You make it real for me yeah

;Chorus

[Mid 8]
.G                      F                  C
 Everybody’s talking in words I don't understand
.G                              F                C
 You got to be the only one who knows just who I am
.Em                               F 
 You’re shining in the distance I hope I can make it through
.          D/F#              D             G                                    
 Cause the only place that I want to be is right back home with you 

[V4]
 I guess there's so much more I have to learn
 But if you're here with me, I know which way to turn
 You always give me somewhere, somewhere I can run
 You make it real for me 

;Chorus then repeat last line</lyrics>

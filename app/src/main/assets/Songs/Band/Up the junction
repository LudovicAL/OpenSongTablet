  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E    A    E    A    (E)  STOP

[V1]
.E                        A                                E
 I never thought it would happen with me and the girl from Clapham
.                 C#m                           E
 Out on the windy common, that night I ain't forgotten
.                       A                          E
 When she dealt out the rations with summer of her passions
.                 C#m                      E
 I said you are a lady, perhaps she said I maybe

[V2]
 We moved into a basement with thoughts of our engagement
 We stayed in by the telly although the room was smelly
 We spent our time just kissing, the railway arms were missing
 But love it got us hooked up and all the time it took us

[V3]
 I got a job with Stanley, he said I'd come in handy
 And started me on Monday, so I had a bath on Sunday
 I worked eleven hours and bought the girl some flowers
 She said she'd seen a doctor and nothing now could stop her

[C]
.C#m                      G#m                           F#m
 I worked all through the winter, the weather brass and bitter
.             Bm                           Dm
 I put away a tenner each week to make her better
.                      Am                       Gm
 And when the time was ready we had to sell the telly
.                    F                        A
 The evenings by the fire, the little kicks inside her

[V4]
.D                    G                       D
 This morning at four fifty I took her rather nifty
.               Bm                          D
 Down to an incubator, where thirty minutes later
.                    G                         D
 She gave birth to a daughter, within a year a walker
.                         Bm                        D       D  D A    *back to E
 She looked just like her mother, if there could be another

[V5]
 And now she's two years older, her mother's with a soldier
 She left me when my drinking became a proper stinging
 The devil came and took me, from Barter street to bookie
 No more nights by the telly, no more nights left with smelly
 
;QUIETER
[V6]
 Alone here in the kitchen I feel there's something missing
 I'd beg for some forgiveness, but begging's not my business
 And she won't write a letter although I always tell her
 And so it's my assumption I'm realy up the junction

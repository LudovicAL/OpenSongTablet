.C         C/E                      F       G
 When your legs don't work like they used to before
.C     C/E                        F  G
 And I can't sweep you off of your feet
.C         C/E                     F           G
 Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
.C         C/E                       F      G
 Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

[P1]
.              C C/E           F    G         C  C/E  F  G
 And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
.           C  C/E                      F  G    C  C/E  F  G
 And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
.                           Dm7                    G          C
 And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
.Dm7                      G
 Maybe just the touch of a hand
.      Dm7                        G            Am
 Well, me I fall in love with you every single day
.    Dm7                     G
 And I just wanna tell you I am

[C]
 So honey now
 Take me into your loving arms
 Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
 Place your head on my beating heart
 I'm thinking out loud
.           Am G     F    C/E  Dm7     G  C   
 That maybe we found love right where we are

[V2]
 When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
 And the crowds don't remember my name
 When my hands don't play the strings the same way
 I know you will still love me the same

[P2]
 'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
 And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
 I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
 Maybe it's all part of a plan
 Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
 Hoping that you'll understand

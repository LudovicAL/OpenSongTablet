.G                G2          
 What the hell is wrong with you tonight?   
.G               G2                  Em   Em  D  G
 I can't seem to say or do the right thing
.G            G2          
 Wanted to be sure you're feeling right
.G            G2                    Em    Em D (pause/push)
 Wanted to be sure we want the same thing
.C   G               C     G   Em  Bm              Em   Bm  (pause/push)
 She says, I can't believe it, You can't, possibly mean it
.C     G                C    G      Em   Bm
 Don't we, all want the same thing, don't we
.      F           C           G     Am7/G 
 Well, who said anything about love...............?
.Bm/G   Am7/G          Bb        C/Bb           Bb            C/Bb
 No not love she said, Don't you know that it's different for girls?
.               G    Am7/G     Bm/G   Am7/G
 (Don't give me love.........) No not love she said
.Bb        C/Bb           Bb            C/Bb    Bb             C/Bb  Bb
 Don't you know that it's different for girls?  You're all the same

[V2]
 Mama always told me save yourself
 Take a little time and find the right girl
 Then again don't end up on the shelf
 Logical advice gets you in a whirl
 I know, a lot of things that you don't you wanna hear some
 She said, just give me something, anything
 Well give me all you got but not love.......
 No not love she said, don't you know that it's different for girls?
 (Don't give me love.........) No not love she said
 Don't you know that it's different for girls?
 You're all the same (your all the same) You're all the same (you're all the same)
 You're all the same (your all the same) You're all the same (you're all the same)

[T]
.               G     Am7/G    Bm/G   Am7/G
 (Don't give me love.........) No not love she said 
.Bb        C/Bb           Bb            C/Bb  
 Don't you know that it's different for girls?   REPEAT x3
.               Bb
 You're all the same</lyrics>

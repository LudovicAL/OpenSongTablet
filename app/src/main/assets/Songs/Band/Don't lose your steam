  <lyrics>[Intro]
.Em           A
;Keys/sax all in

[V1]
.Em       
 Sitting on the top of the roof, the bridge is all mine,
.                                                          A
 Steam engines roll by, the bridges fall down and so do my dreams
.Em                 
 Boy, you hear me calling your name, the bridge is your time, 
 Your engine rolls hot, if the bridges fall down,
.                        A
 Don't lose your head of steam

[Chorus]
.      C                    Am
 Young man, I'm counting on you
.    C                    D                (Em       A)
 And whoa, young man, I'm counting on you

[V2]
 Boy, I didn't make it too far, but baby you are,
 The family star, I'll tighten your seams,
 Don't lose your head of dreams
 Boy, you hear me calling your name, the bridge is your time
 Your engine rolls hot, if the bridges fall down, 
 Don't lose your head of steam

[Chorus]
 Young man, I'm counting on you
 And whoa, young man, I'm counting on you
 To get me to the other side, hey, hey hey hey, hey

[Verse 3]
 This foot-pound pressure is new, whatever you do is up to you
 But do me this do: don't lose your head of dreams

[Chorus]
 Young man, I'm counting on you
 And whoa, young man, I'm counting on you

[Solo (Keys/sax)]
[Chorus x2]

  <lyrics>[INTRO AS VERSE]

[V1]
.C         C#dim      Dm7       G
 I get too hungry for dinner at eight
.C          C#dim       Dm7        G
 I like the theatre but never come late
.C       Gm7/C       Fmaj7    Fm/Bb
 I never bother with people I hate
.C      Am7     Dm7  G    C  Am7  Dm7  G
 That's why the lady is a tramp

[V2]
 I like the crap games with barons and earls
 Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
 Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
 That's why the lady is a tramp

[C]
.            F    G     C          Am
 I like that cool fresh wind in my hair
.Dm           G
 Life without care
.C   Am7    Dm7  G	
 I'm broke, it's oke!
.C        Gm7/C        
 Hate California
.     Fmaj7         Fm/Bb
 It's cold and it's damp
.C      Am7     Dm7  G    C  Am7  Dm7  G
 That's why the lady is a tramp</lyrics></song>

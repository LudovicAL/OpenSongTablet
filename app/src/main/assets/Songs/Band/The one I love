  <title>The one I love</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.      C                      G
 Gonna close my eyes girl and watch you go
.        F                                C
 Running through this life darling like a field of snow
.       C                    G
 As the tracer glides in its graceful arc
.       F                                   C
 Send a little prayer out to ya, 'cross the falling dark
.         F                Dm
 Tell the repo man and the stars above
.           C           C
 You're the one I love, yeah

[V2]
 Perfect summer's night, not a wind that breathes
 Just the bullets whispering gentle 'mongst the new green leaves
 There's things I might have said, only wish I could
 Now I'm leaking life faster than I'm leaking blood
.         F                Dm
 Tell the repo man and the stars above
.                C                      G
 That you're the one I love, you're the one I love
.    Dm       F     Am  G  F     Am  G  F      Am  G  F
 The one I love

[V3]
 Don't see Elysium, do see no fiery hell
 Just the lights up brightly baby in the bay hotel
 Next wave coming in, like an ocean roar
 Won't you take my hand darling on that old dance floor
.       F                       Dm
 We can twist and shout, do the turtle dove
                C                      G
 And you're the one I love, you're the one I love
     Dm       F     Am  G  F     Am  G  F      Am  G  F
 The one I love</lyrics>

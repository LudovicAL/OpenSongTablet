.Bb    Bb/Ab     Eb     Eb/F    x3
  
[V1]
.Bb         Bb/Ab               Eb             Eb/F           Bb Bb/Ab Eb Eb/F
 Ever see a blind man cross the road trying to make the other side
.Bb         Bb/Ab              Eb             Eb/F           Bb Bb/Ab Eb Eb/F
 Ever see a young girl growing old, trying to make herself a bride
.Gm                 F/A 
 So what becomes of you my love
.Bb                     C
 When they have finally stripped you of
.    Eb
 The handbags and the gladrags
.          Eb/F                            (Bb Bb/Ab Eb Eb/F)  x2
 That your poor old Grandad had to sweat to buy you

[V2]
 Once I was a young man and all I thought I had to do was smile
 Well you are still a young girl and you bought everything in style
 So once you think you're in you're out
 'Cos you don't mean a single thing without
 The handbags and the gladrags
 That your poor old Grandad had to sweat to buy you

[V3]
 Sing a song of six-pence for your sake and take a bottle full of rye
 Four and twenty blackbirds in a cake and bake them all in a pie
 They told me you missed school today
 So what I suggest you just throw them all away
 The handbags and the gladrags
 That your poor old Grandad had to sweat to buy

[Break]
.Bb  Bb/Ab  Eb  Eb/F  x 2

[B]
.Gm                      F/A
 They told me you missed school today
.Bb                         C
 So what I suggest you just throw them all away
.    Eb             
 The handbags and the gladrags
.          Eb/F                             (Bb)
 That your poor old Grandad had to sweat to buy you

[V1]
Don't take advantage of me cause I'm good to you
Don't take advantage of me cause I'm good to you
I'm just another man hooked on you
Tell me baby what the hell you're gonna do
I wanna know .....

[V2]
Don't think I'm weak cause I'm sweet to you
Don't think I'm weak cause I'm sweet to you
Another man, another time
I'll wipe that stuff right outa your mind
Yes I will .....

[SOLO]

[V3]
Don't think I'm crazy cause I do what I do
Don't think I'm crazy cause I do what I do 
It's another man, another place
I throw that mess right back in your face
Yes I will

[V4]
Don't think I'm crazy cause I do what I do
Don't think I'm crazy cause I do what I do 
It's another man, another place
I throw that mess right back in your face
Yes I will

[SOLO]

;REPEAT VERSE 1

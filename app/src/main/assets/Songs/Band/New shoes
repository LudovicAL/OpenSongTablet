  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Bb     C
 
[V1]
.C                        Eb                    Bb
 Woke up cold on Tuesday, I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
.C                                             Eb         G
 I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life
.C
 So I quickly opened the wardrobe 
.Eb                          Bb
 Pulled out some jeans and a t-shirt that seemed clean
.C                                                Eb                G
 Topped it off with a pair of old shoes that were ripped around the seams
.              Bb
 And I thought these shoes just don't suit me

[C]
.C              G                F
 Hey I put some new shoes on and suddenly everything's right
.        C               G             F
 I said, hey, I put some new shoes on, everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
.   C                  G            F
 Oh short on money but long on time slowly strollin' in the sweet sunshine
.        C                        G
 And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
.           F
 'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

[V2]
 Woke up late one Thursday, I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
 And I felt like there were two days missing as I focused on the time
 And I made my way to the kitchen, 
 But I had to stop from the shock of what I found
 A room full of all my friends dancing round and round
 And I thought, hello new shoes, bye bye blues

;CHORUS

[Mid8]
.Bb C
 Take me wandering through these streets
 Where bright lights and angels meet
.Bb C
 Stone to stone they take me on, 
 I walking to the break of dawn                     x2

;CHORUS x2</lyrics>

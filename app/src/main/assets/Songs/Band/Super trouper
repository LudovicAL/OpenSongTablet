[Intro]
.G      G      Em      Am      Am      D      D

[V1]
.G			     Bm
 I was sick and tired of everything, 
.       Am                         D
 When I called you last night from Glasgow
.G                             Bm
 All I do is eat and sleep and sing, 
.        Am                 D
 Wishing every show was the last show
.C                G/B 
 So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
.C                 G/B 
 Suddenly I feel alright
.C                    G
 And it's gonna be so different
.		       Dsus4  D
 When I'm on the stage tonight

[C]
.            G     Gsus4   G 
 Tonight the Super trouper lights are gonna find me
.Gsus4   G        D    Am              D
 Shining like the sun, smiling, having fun
.		      G
 Feeling like a number one
.            G     Gsus4   G
 Tonight the Super trouper beams are gonna blind me
.Gsus4 G          D    Am            D
 But I won't feel blue like I always do
.				      G
 'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

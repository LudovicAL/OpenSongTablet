  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Em   D   C   D   Em......etc. 

[C]
.Em            D                   C         D 
 I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord 
.Em                             D                 C        D 
 And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord 
.Em              D                   C         D        Em 
 Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, Oh Lord..... 

[V1]
.        Em 
 Well if you told me you were drowning 
.  D 
 I would not lend a hand 
.     C         
 I've seen your face before my friend 
.            Em 
 But I don't know if you know who I am 
.     Em 
 Well I was there and I saw what you did 
.  D 
 I saw it with my own two eyes 
.           C 
 So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been 
.     Em 
 It's all been a pack of lies 

;CHORUS 

[V2]
 Well I remember, I remember don't worry 
 How could I ever forget, it's the first time, the last time we ever met 
 But I know the reason why you keep the silence up 
 No you don't fool me 
 The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows 
 It's no stranger to you or me 

;DRUMS TO REPEAT 

;CHORUS TO END</lyrics>

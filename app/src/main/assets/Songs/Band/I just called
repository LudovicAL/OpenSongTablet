.Db   Ab   Db

[V1]
.   Ab         Db   Dbmaj7 
 No New Year's Day, to celebrate 
.             Db7                          Ebm Ebmaj7 
 No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away 
 No first of spring, no song to sing 
.                            Ab       Db 
 In fact here's just another ordinary day 

[V2]
 No April rain, no flowers bloom 
 No wedding saturday within the month of June 
 But what it is, is something true 
 Made up of these three words that I must say to you 

[C]
.Bbm    Ebm       Ab    Db 
 I just called to say I love you 
.Bbm    Ebm       Ab             Bbm 
 I just called to say how much I care 
.       Ebm       Ab    Bbm 
 I just called to say I love you 
.      Ebm7             Ab           Db 
 And I mean it from the bottom of my heart 

;REPEAT VERSE 1 AND 2

 I just called to say I love you 
.      Em7              A            D 
 And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

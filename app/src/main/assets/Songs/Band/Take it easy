  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G    C   D  x2	    

[V1]
.         G
 Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
.                  D     C 
 I got seven women on my mind
.G                         D          
 Four that want to own me, two who want to stone me
.C                          G	 
 One says she's a friend of mine
.        Em (D)*       C  G          *Verse 2 and solo only
 Take it easy, take it easy
.              Am                C                Em
 Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
.        C                  G               C           G 
 Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to understand  
.            Am                 C              G 
 Just find a place to make your stand, take it easy 

[V2]
 Well I'm standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
 It's such a fine sight to see
 It's a girl my Lord, in a flat bed ford 
 Slowin' down to take a look at me
 Come on baby, don't say maybe
 I've gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
 We may lose and we may win but we will never be here again
 So open up, I'm climbin' in, take it easy

[GUITAR]
.G    D  C     G      D      C     G
.Em   D  C     G      Am     C     Em    D 

[V3]
 Well I'm runnin' down the road trying to loosen my load
.      G                D     Am
 Got a world of trouble on my mind
 Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
 She's so hard to find
 Take it easy, take it easy
 Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
 Come on baby, don't say maybe
 I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me

[Outro]
.C                 G           C           G
 Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
.C                         G   F      C	  
 Oooh, oooh, gonna take it ea.........sy, 
.              G   F   C   Em
 Gonna take it ea..â€¦...sy  </lyrics></song>

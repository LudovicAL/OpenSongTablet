  <lyrics>[INTRO[
.G x4    Am  D  G

[V1]
.G                             D                         Am   D
 It’s another tequila sunrise, staring slowly across the sky
.         G
 Said goodbye
.G                         D                                   Am    D
 He was just a hired hand, working on the dreams he planned to try
.G
 The days go by

[B]
.Em                   C
 Every night when the sun goes down
.Em           C
 Just another lonely boy in town
.Am                D
 She’s out running around

[V2]
 She wasn’t just another woman, and I couldn’t keep from coming on
 It’s been so long
 Whoah and it’s a hollow feeling, 
 When it comes down to dealing friends, it never ends

[GUITAR]
.G    D    Am  D    G

[Mid 8]
.Am           D
 Take another shot of courage,
.Bm             E                 Am    B7
 Wonder why the right words never come
.             Em   A7
 You just get numb

[V3]
 It’s another tequila sunrise, this old world still looks the same
 Another friend
 Ah ooooooooh     Ah ooooooh …….. (to end)</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.                   Am7
 Just shoot for the stars if it feels right 
 And aim for my heart if you feel like
.            Dm7
 And take me away and make it OK, 
 I swear I'll behave  ….[RIFF]
.              Am7
 You wanted control, so we waited, 
 I put on a show, now I make it
.              Dm7
 You say I'm a kid, my ego is big, 
 I don't give a ….[RIFF]  and it goes like this

[C]
.Am7
 Take me by the tongue and I'll know you, 
 Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
.       Dm7
 All the moves like Jagger, I've got the moves like Jagger
 I've got the moves like Jagger
.Am7
 I don't need to try to control you, 
 Look into my eyes and I'll own you
.          Dm7
 With them moves like Jagger, I've got the moves like Jagger
 I've got the moves like Jagger

[V2]
 Maybe it's hard when you feel like 
 You're broken and scarred nothing feels right
 But when you're with me, I'll make you believe 
 That I've got the key ….[RIFF]
 So get in the car, we can ride it, wherever you want, get inside it
 And you want to steer, but I'm shifting gears, 
 I'll take it from here ….[RIFF]  and it goes like this

[C]

[Mid 8]
.Am7
 You wanna know how to make me smile, 
 Take control, just for the night
.Dm7
 And if I share my secret, you're gonna have to keep it, 
 Nobody else can see this
.Am7
 So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
 Head to toe, baby rub me right
.Dm7
 But if I share my secret, you're gonna have to keep it
 Nobody else can see this (Ay ay ay ay!)........and it goes like this

[Chorus x2]

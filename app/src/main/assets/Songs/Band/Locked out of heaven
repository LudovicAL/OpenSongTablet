  <lyrics>[Intro]
.C  Dm  C  Bb  F  Gm
 Oh yea, yea

[V1]
.C  Dm  C  Bb  F  Gm
      Never had much faith in love or miracles
.C  Dm  C  Bb  F  Gm
      Never would have put my heart on the line
.C  Dm  C  Bb  F  Gm
      I’m swimming in your world of something spiritual 
.C  Dm  C  Bb  F  Gm                                     
      I’m gonna get it every time you spend the night

[C]
.C  Dm  C  Bb  F  Gm                                     
 Cause your sex takes me to paradise
.F  Gm                                     
 Yea, your sex takes me to paradise
.        F         A
 And you chose the gates
 
.                  Bb
 Cause you make me feel like
.                        Gm
 I’ve been locked out of heaven
.        F             C
 For too long, for too long
.                       Bb
 Yea, cause you make me feel like
.                        Gm
 I’ve been locked out of heaven
.        F             C
 For too long, for too long

[Break]
.C  Dm  C  Bb  F  Gm 
           Oh yea yea x2

[V2] 
 You bring me to my knees You make me testify
 You could make a sinner change his ways 
 Open up your gates cause I can’t wait to see your light
 And right there is where I want to stay, stay

;Chorus

[B]
.   Bb        Gm                 F
 Oh woah, oh yea, you might just stay here
.                     C
 Spend the rest of my days here
.   Bb        Gm                 F
 Oh woah, oh yea, you might just stay here
.                     C
 Spend the rest of my days here

;Chorus

[Outro]
.C  Dm  C  Bb  F  Gm 
           Oh yea yea x2
.C  Dm

  <lyrics>[V1]
.F
 My house in Budapest, my, my hidden treasure chest,
 Golden grand piano, my beautiful Castillo
.Bb                                F
 You,  Ooh, you, ooh, I'd leave it all

[V2]
 My acres of a land, that I've achieved
 It may be hard for you to, stop and believe
 You,  Ooh, you, ooh, I'd leave it all
 You,  Ooh, you, ooh, I'd leave it all

[C]
.C
 Give me one good reason
.    Bb                         F
 Why I should never make a change
.C
 Baby if you hold me
.     Bb                     F
 Then all of this will go away

[V3]
 My many artifacts, the list goes on
 If you just say the words, I, I'll up and run
 You,  Ooh, you, ooh, I'd leave it all
 You,  Ooh, you, ooh, I'd leave it all

;Chorus x2

;Solo over Chorus

[V4]
 My friends and family, they don't understand
 They fear they'll lose so much, if you take my hand
 You,  Ooh, you, ooh, I'd leave it all
 You,  Ooh, you, ooh, I'd leave it all

;Chorus x2

;Repeat verse 1 and last line

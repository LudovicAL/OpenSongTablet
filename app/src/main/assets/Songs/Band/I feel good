.       D                                     G
 I feel good, I knew that I would now, I feel good, I knew that I would now
.   A        G              D   D/F#  D/A  D/C  D/E
 So good, so good, I've got you

 I feel nice, ah sugar n spice, I feel nice, ah sugar n spice
 So nice, so nice, I've got you

.G                             D
 When I hold you in my arms, I know that I can't do no wrong
.G                                  A
 And when I hold you in my arms, my love won't do you no harm

 I feel nice, ah sugar n spice, I feel nice, ah sugar n spice
 So nice, so nice, I've got you

 When I hold you in my arms, I know that I can't do no wrong
 And when I hold you in my arms, my love can't do me no harm

 I feel nice, ah sugar n spice, I feel nice, ah sugar n spice
 So nice, so nice, I've got you
 
[V5]
 I feel good, I knew that I would now, I feel good, I knew that I would now
 So good, so good, I've got you
 So good, so good, I've got you
 So good, so good, I've got you</lyrics>

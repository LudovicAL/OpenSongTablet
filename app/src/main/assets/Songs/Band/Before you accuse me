  <title>Before you accuse me</title>
  <lyrics>;12 Bar blues
.E

[C]
 Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
 Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
 You say I’m spending my money on other women
 You’re taking money from someone else

[V1]
 I called your mama about three or four nights ago
 I called your mama about three or four nights ago
 Well your mama said “son, don’t call my daughter no more”

;CHORUS

;INSTR as chorus

[V2]
 Come on back home baby, try my love one more time
 Come on back home baby, try my love one more time
 You know if things don’t go to suit you I think I’ll lose my mind

;INSTR as chorus to end</lyrics>

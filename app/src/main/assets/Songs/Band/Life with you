  <lyrics>[V1]
.E                    A/E   E                  A/E
 When I was a younger man.  When I was a silly boy
.E        A/E              E             A/E        
 I didn't need a thing, I, was strong as anything, I
.F#7                  B7
 Viewed solitude as a joy

[V2]
 But since I met you I'm distraught,
 You wandered in and now I'm caught
 I never thought I would see
 Someone so truly good
 Someone who's everything I'm not

[C]
.(E)                          A
 I want to spend my life with you
.E                      A
 Don't want to live all alone
.E          G#m          A             C#m
 I can't conceive of the years left in me
.F#m7    B7         E
 Without you in our home

[V3]
 But what if, what if, what if what,  if it's not perfect then it's not
 But every care I'll take, nothing I won't forsake
 To dwell beside what you've got

[B]
.A                  E
 Everytime I think about you, 
.                         F#7
 I think I can't live without you
.                                              B7
 I'll tell you something, I am nothing without you.....

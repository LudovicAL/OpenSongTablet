[C]
.           C                         E7
 Why do you build me up (build me up) buttercup baby
.        F                             G7
 Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around
.         C                               E7
 And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call baby
.         F                                G7
 When you say you will (say you will), but I love you still
.       C                          C7/Bb        
 I need you (I need you) more than anyone darling
.    F/A                       Fm/Ab
 You know that I have from the start  
.   C                         G7                        F F/E F/D C G7
 So build me up (build me up) buttercup, don't break my heart   

[V1]
.        C       G                  Bb        F
 I'll be over at ten you've told me time and again 
.           C            F
 But you're late I wait around and then  (ba, ta, da)              
.  C          G            Bb      F
 I run to the door I can't take anymore 
.         C               F
 Itâ€™s not you, you let me down again  
.           Dm              G7
 (Hey, hey, hey) Baby, baby try to find 
            Em                     Am
 (Hey, hey, hey) A little time and I'll make you mine
.           F                            D/F#
 (Hey, hey, hey) I'll be home, I'll be beside the phone 
.            G7     G7     G7
 Waiting for you    Oooh oooh   
 
;CHORUS

[V2]
 You are my toy But I could be the boy 
 You adore if you just let me know (ba ta da) 
 I tell you I'm true I'm attracted to you  
 All the more, why do I need you so
 (Hey, hey, hey) Baby, baby try to find 
 (Hey, hey, hey) A little time and I'll make you mine 
 (Hey, hey, hey) I'll be home, I'll be beside the phone 
 Waiting for you    Oooh oooh

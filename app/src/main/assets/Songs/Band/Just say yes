.C       F       C/E       F        x2

[V1]
.C                  F       C/E      F
 I'm running out of ways to make you see
.C             F         C/E    F
 I want you to stay here beside me
.C          F                 C/E       F
 I won't be ok and I won't pretend I am
.C                 F       C/E     F
 So just tell me today and take my hand
.       C/E                   F            C/E                   F
 Please take my hand (oohoo oohoo), please take my hand (oohoo oohoo)
.       C/E                   F            C/E                   F
 Please take my hand (oohoo oohoo), please take my hand (oohoo oohoo)

[C]
.         C             F               C/E         F
 Just say yes, just say there's nothing holding you back
.           C           F            C/E        F
 It's not a test, nor a trick of the mind, only love

[V2]
 It's so simple and you know it is, you know it is, yeah
 We can't be to and fro like this, all our lives
 You're the only way to me, the path is clear
 What do I have to say to you for Gods sake, dear
 For Gods sake, dear (oohoo oohoo), for Gods sake, dear (oohoo oohoo)
 For Gods sake, dear (oohoo oohoo), for Gods sake, dear (oohoo oohoo)

[C]
 Just say yes, just say there's nothing holding you back
 It's not a test, nor a trick of the mind, only love
 Just say yes, coz Im aching and I know you are too
 For the touch of your warm skin, as I breathe you in

[V3]
 I can feel your heart beat through my shirt
 This was all I wanted, all I want
 Its all I want (ooohooo ooohoo), its all I want (ooohooo ooohoo)
 Its all I want (ooohooo ooohoo), its all I want (ooohooo ooohoo)

[C]
 Just say yes, just say there's nothing holding you back
 It's not a test, nor a trick of the mind, only love
 Just say yes, coz Im aching and I know you are too
 For the touch of your warm skin, as I breathe you in</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.F    Dm   Bb   C    F

[V1]
.         F                      Dm
 When the night has come and the land is dark
.        Bb         C                F
 And the moon is the only light we'll see
.      F                      Dm
 No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
.        Bb          C               F
 Just as long as you stand, stand by me
 
[C]
.C                     F                Dm
 And darling, darling, stand by me, oh, stand by me
.   Bb          C               F  (C to repeat)
 Oh stand, yeah stand, stand by me

[V2]
 If the sky that we look upon, should tumble and fall
 And the mountains should crumble to the sea
 I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
 Just as long as you stand, stand by me</lyrics>

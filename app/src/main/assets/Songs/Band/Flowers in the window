  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.C  G/B  Am  D  Fm  G x2

[V1]
.G                           F     G                       Am
 When I first held you I was cold, a melting snowman I was told
.G                             F
 But there was no-one there to hold
.  F                 G                       (C)
 Before I swore that I would be alone forever more

[C]
.C    C/B              Am             Am/G
 Wow, look at you now, flowers in the window
.            D                  Fm                     G
 It's such a lovely day and I'm glad that you feel the same
.              C  C/B               Am               Am/G
 'Cos to stand up out in the crowd, you are one in a million
.      D                 Fm                G    
 And I love you so let's watch the flowers grow

[V2]
 There is no reason to feel bad         
.                                   Am    Am/C Am/E
 But there are many seasons to feel glad, sad, mad
 It's just a bunch of feelings that we have to hold
 But I am here to help you with the load

;CHORUS

;CHORUS   -  La Las

[V3]
 So now we're here and now is fine
.                                     Am    Am/C  Am/E
 So far away from there, and there is time, time, time
 To plant new seeds and watch them grow
 So there'll be flowers in the window when we go

;CHORUS  x2

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Eb Ebmaj7 Eb7 Ebmaj7 x2 

[V1]
.Eb      Ebmaj7 
 Kiss me out of the bearded barley. 
.Eb7      Ebmaj7 
 Nightly, beside the green, green grass. 
.Eb            Ebmaj7 
 Swing, swing, swing the spinning step. 
.Eb7                             Ab 
 You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress. 

[C]
.    Fm   Bb Eb          Cm 
 Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight. 
.Fm   Bb Eb         Eb7 
 Lead me out on the moonlit floor. 
.Fm        Bb 
 Lift your open hand 
.Eb            Eb/D              Cm               
 Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance, 
.Eb/Bb         Ab         Bb ..... 
 Silver moon's sparkling 
.        Eb     (as intro stop on last chord) 
 So kiss me. 

[V2]
 Kiss me down by the broken tree house. 
 Swing me upon its hanging tire. 
 Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat. 
 We'll take the trail marked on your father's map.

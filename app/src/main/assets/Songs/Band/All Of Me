.Em           Cmaj7                  G  
 What would I do without your smart mouth
.           D                  Em
 Drawing me in, and kicking me out
.            C            G                D       Em
 Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
.             Cmaj7                G
 What's going on in that beautiful mind
.            D               Em
 I'm on your magical mystery ride
.        C              G                     D        Am
 And I'm so dizzy, dont know what hit me, but I'll be alright
 
[P]
.Am              G     D             Am
 My heads under water, but I'm breathing fine
.                G             D
 You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
 
[C]
.       G              Emadd9
 Cause all of me loves all of you
.          C                                   C/D          D
 Love your curves and all your edges, all your perfect imperfections
.          G                       Emadd9
 Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
.          C                          C/D             D
 You're my end and my beginning, even when I lose I'm winning
.                  Em   C      G   D
 Cause I give you all, all of me
.                 Em   C      G    D
 And you give me all, all of you, oh
 
[V2]
 How many times do I have to tell you
 Even when you're crying youâ€™re beautiful too
 The world is beating you down, Im around through every move
 You're my downfall, you're my muse
 My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
 I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
 
;Prechorus
;Chorus
 
[P2]
.Am            G           D            Am
 Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
.Am         G                D
 Risking it all, though it's hard
 
;Chorus

[Outro]
.                  Em   C      G
 Cause I give you all, all of me
.                 Em   C      G    D
 And you give me all, all of you, oh

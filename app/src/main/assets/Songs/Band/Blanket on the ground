  <lyrics>[V1]
.                              D
 Come and look out through the window
.                            Em
 The big old moon is shinin' down
.                       A                            D
 Tell me now don't it remind you of a blanket on the ground

[V2]
 Remember back when love first found us
 We'd go slippin' out of town
 And we'd love beneath the moonlight
 On a blanket on the ground
 
[C]
.D7                            G
 I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
.                          D
 And we'll go walkin' once again
.                        A7                               D
 To the spot down by the river where our sweet love first began
.D7                  G                                 D
 Just because we are married don't mean we can't slip around
.                              A7
 So let's walk out through the moonlight
.                           D
 And lay the blanket on the ground

[V3]
 Oh remember how excited
 We used to get when love was young
 That old moon was our best buddy
 We couldn't wait for night to come

[V4]
 Now you know you still excite me
 I know you love me like I am
 Just once more I wish you love me
 On the blanket on the ground

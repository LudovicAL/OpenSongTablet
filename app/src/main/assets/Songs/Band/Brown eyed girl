  <lyrics>[V1]
.G             C      G             D7
 Hey where did we go, days when the rains came
.G           C       G         D7
 Down in the hollow, playin' a new game, 
.G              C                 G              D7
 Laughing and a running hey, hey, skipping and a jumping 
.G            C                 G        D                     C
 In the misty morning fog with, ooh, our hearts a thumpin' and you 
.D             G Em  C   D             G (D7)
 My brown eyed girl, You my brown eyed girl. 
 
[V2]
 Whatever happened, to Tuesday and so slow 
 Going down the old mine, with a transistor radio 
 Standing in the sunlight laughing,
 Hiding behind a rainbow's wall, 
 Slipping and sliding, All along the water fall, with you 
 My brown eyed girl, You my brown eyed girl. 
 
[P]
.D7 
 Do you remember when we used to sing, 
.G         C              G           D7
 Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da 
.G         C              G           D        G
 Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da
 
[BASS SOLO]
 
[V3]
 So hard to find my way, Now that I'm all on my own. 
 I saw you just the other day, My how you have grown, 
 Cast my memory back there, Lord,
 Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout it
 Making love in the green grass, behind the stadium with you 
 My brown eyed girl, You my brown eyed girl</lyrics></song>

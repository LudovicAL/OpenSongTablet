  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Am        G/B  C        Am        G/B   C  (all through)

[V1]
 You won't find him drinking at the table
 Rolling dice and staying out till three
 You won't ever find him being unfaithful
 You will find, you will find him next to me
 You won't find him trying to change the devil
 For money, fame, power out of grief
 You won't ever find him where the rest go
 You will find, you will find him next to me

[C]
 Next to me, ooh hoo,  next to me, ooh hoo
 Next to me, ooh hoo,
 You will find, you will find him next to me

[V2]
 When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
 When we spoil the land and dried up all the sea
 When everyone's lost their head all around us
 You will find, you will find him next to me
 Never in my life have I met someone like him
 I'm blown away by his love for me
 If you ever wonder where it is you'll find him
 You will find, you will find him next to me

;CHORUS

[V3]
 When the money's spent and all my friends have vanished
 And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
 I know there's no need for me to panic    
 'Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me
 When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
 And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
 All I need is a helping hand to stop the tears from falling
 I will find him, will find him next to me

;CHORUS</lyrics>

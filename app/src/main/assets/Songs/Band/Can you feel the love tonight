  <lyrics>[Intro]
.Bb F/A Eb/Bb Bb/F
.Eb Bb/D F/A Bb Cm7 Bb/D

[V1]
.Eb               Bb/D     Eb             Bb/D
 There's a calm surrender, to the rush of day
.Eb                   Bb/D         Cm7           F
 When the heat of the rolling wind can be turned away
.Eb           Bb/D   Eb             Bb/D
 An enchanted moment and it sees me through
.Eb                   Gm
 It's enough for this restless warrior,
.Ab              F
 Just to be with you

[C]
.    Bb      F/A      Gm     Eb
 And can you feel the love tonight?
.Bb    Eb    C/E F
 It is where we  are
.Eb   Bb/D            Gm   Bb   Eb
 It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
.Cm   Bb Eb  C/E  F
 That we got this far
.    Bb      F/A      Gm     Eb
 And can you feel the love tonight?
.Bb       Eb   C/E F
 How it's laid to  rest?
.Eb    Bb/D          Gm    Bb  Eb
 It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
.  Cm    Bb/D Eb   Eb/Bb Bb
 Believe the  ve - ry    best

[Interlude]
.Bb F/A Eb/Bb Bb/F
.Eb Bb/D F/A Bb Cm7 Bb/D

[V2]
.Eb                 Bb/D      Eb           Bb/D
 There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
.Eb                  Bb/D        Cm              F
 That the twisting kaleidoscope, moves us all in turn
.Eb                  Bb/D    Eb             Bb/D
 There's a rhyme and reason, to the wild outdoors
.Eb                     Gm
 When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
.Ab                 F     F
 Beats in time with yours

;Chorus

[Ending (slow)]
.Eb    Bb            Gm    Bb  Eb
 It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
.  Cm    Bb  Eb  Eb/Bb Bb
 Believe the ve - ry  best</lyrics>

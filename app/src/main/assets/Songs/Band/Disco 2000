.F    F    Bb                       

[V1]
.           F 
 Oh we were born within an hour of each other, 
 Our mothers said we could be sister and brother, 
.             Bb 
 Your name is Deborah, it never suited yah ! 
.         F 
 And they said that when we grew up, 
 We'd get married and never split up, 
.            Bb  
 Oh we never did do, although I often thought of it. 
.                      Cm 
 Well Deborah do you recall ? 
 Your house was very small, with woodchip on the wall 
.                                                   F 
 When I came round to call, you didn't notice me at all 

[C]
.            Bb                 
 And I said, let's all meet up in the year 2000, 
.Dm                                       Gm 
 Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown. 
.                             Cm                Bb F 
 Think back to a clock by the fountain down the road 
.Bb    
 I never knew that you'd get married 
.    Dm                                Gm 
 And I would be living down here on my own 
.                         Cm              Bb F 
 I'm not down and lonely, Thursday, years ago 

[V2]
 You were the first girl at school to get breasts 
 And Brian said that you were the best 
 Oh all the boys all loved you, but I was a mess 
 I had to work to try and get you undressed 
 We were friends, that was as far as it went 
 I used to walk you home sometimes but it meant 
 Oh it meant nothing to ya !  Cause you were so popular 
 Well Deborah do you recall ? 
 Your house was very small, with woodchip on the wall 
 When I came round to call, you didn't notice me at all

;CHORUS

[BREAK]
.F    (guitar)  Bb   (all) 

[Mid 8]
 Well Deborah do you recall ? 
 Your house was very small, with woodchip on the wall 
 When I came round to call, you didn't notice me at all

.Dm 
 Would you like to come and meet me maybe ?

.Gm                              Cm    F    Bb 
 You can even bring your baby !  Ooooooohh  oooooooh</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.G          D/F# Em
 Almost heaven,  west Virginia
.D                     C          G
 Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah river.
.G             D/F# Em
 Life is older,     older than the trees,
.D                           C              G
 Younger than the mountains, flowin' like a breeze.

[C]
.(D)     G              D            Em      C
 Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong;
.        G               D
 West Virginia, mountain momma,
.        C             G
 Take me home, country roads.

[V2]
 All my memories gather round her
 Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
 Dark an' dusty, painted on the sky
 Well I missed the taste of moonshine, teardrop in her eye
 
[C]

[Mid 8]
.Em       D            G
 I hear a voice in the morning as she's callin'
.    C       G              D
 The radio reminds me of ma home far away
.    Em               F              C
 An' driving down the road I get the feelin'
.                     D                D7
 I shoulda' been home yesterday, yesterday!</lyrics></song>

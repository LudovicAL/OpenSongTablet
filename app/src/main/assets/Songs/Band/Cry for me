[C]
 Well I cried so much for you, baby that's nothing new
 Well I cried so much for you, baby that's nothing new
 Now I wish I had one dollar, for all the times I've cried for you

[V1]
Almost every night, I cry myself to sleep
Everybody else is happy, but I just weep, weep, weep
And these tears, tears, tears, why won't they let me be
And I wish just for once, you'd cry for me

[BREAK]

[V2]
Why should I remember, how can I forget
I wake up every morning and my pillow is soaking wet
From these tears, tears, tears, why won't they let me be
Now I wish just for once, you'd cry for me</lyrics>

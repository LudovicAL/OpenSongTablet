.F Bb9 F Bb9

[V1]
.F     
 I thought I saw a man brought to life
.Am                                     Bb7
 He was warm, he came around and he was dignified
.   Bb7
 He showed me what it was to cry
.F
 Well you couldn't be that man I adored
.Am                                             Bb7
 You don't seem to know, seem to care what your heart is for
.    Bb7           
 But I don't know him anymore, 
.        Dm                            C
 There's nothing where he used to lie, the conversation has run dry
.Am                  C                        (F)
 That's what's going on, nothing's fine,  I'm torn

[C]
.F              C                    Dm
 I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
.                  Bb                         F
 I'm cold and I'm ashamed, lying naked on the floor
.F              C                       Dm
 Illusion never changed, into something real
.                   Bb                           F
 I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
.F               C                 Dm     Bb
 You're a little late, I'm already torn

[V2]
.F   
 So I guess the fortune teller's right
.Am          Bb7
 Should've seen just what was there and not some holy light
.       Bb7
 It's crawled beneath my veins and now..
.Dm                                  C
 I don't care, I had no luck, I don't miss him all that much
.Am        C                         (F)
 There's just so many things that I can't touch, I'm torn

;CHORUS

[BREAK]
.Dm       F   C
 Ooooooh  ooh oooh

[MID8]
.        Dm                            C                                         
 There's nothing where he used to lie, the conversation has run dry
.Am                      C                    (F)
 That's what's going on, nothing's fine,  I'm torn

[C2]
.F              C                    Dm
 I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
.                 Bb                          F
 I'm cold and I'm ashamed, lying naked on the floor
.F              C                       Dm
 Illusion never changed, into something real
.                   Bb                           F
 I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn
.F              C                    Dm  
 I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel 
.                   Bb                             F
 I'm cold and I'm ashamed, bound and broken on the floor
.F               C                 Dm  Bb     Dm  C  (C  C  Dm  Bb) x3

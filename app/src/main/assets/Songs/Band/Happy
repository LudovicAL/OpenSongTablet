 It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
 Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
 I'm a hot air balloon, I could go to space
 With the air, like I don't care baby by the way

 (Because I'm happy) clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
.             C#maj7            Cm7                               F7
 (Because I'm happy) clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
.             C#maj7            Cm7                              F7
 (Because I'm happy) clap along if you know what happiness is to you

[V2]
 Here come bad news talking this and that
 (Yeah), give me all you got, don't hold back
 (Yeah), well I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
 (Yeah), no offense to you don't waste your time, here's why

;Chorus

[B]
 (Happy) Bring me down, can't nothing, (Happy) bring me down, love is too
 (Happy) Bring me down, can't nothing, (Happy) bring me down, I said
 (Happy, happy, happy, happy,  Happy, happy, happy, happy)
 Bring me down, can't nothing, bring me down, love is too
 (Happy, happy, happy, happy,  Happy, happy, happy)
 Bring me down, can't nothing, bring me down, I said

;Chorus x2

[B2]
 (Happy, happy, happy, happy,  Happy, happy, happy, happy)
 Bring me down, can't nothing, bring me down, love is too
 (Happy, happy, happy, happy,  Happy, happy, happy)
 Bring me down, can't nothing, bring me down, I said

;Chorus x2</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.D                  
 Give me a second, I, I need to get my story straight
.   Bm
 My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire state
.   G
 My lover she is waiting for me just across the bar
.               Em7                      A7
 My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking about a scar and
.D                                   Bm
 I know I gave it to you months ago, I know you're trying to forget
.      G
 But between the drinks and subtle things, the holes in my apologies
.               Em7                         A7                                     
 You know I'm,  I'm trying hard to take it back, 
.             G            A              Bm        A       G
 So if by the time the bar closes and you feel like falling down, 
.     G         A     (D)
 I'll carry you home tonight......

[C]
.  D      A/C#   Bm
 Tonight, we are young,  
.                      G                                   A7sus4    A                 
 So I set the world on fire, we can burn brighter than the sun  x2

[V2]
 Now I know that I'm not all that you got
 I guess that I, I just thought, maybe we could find a way to fall apart
 But our friends are back, so let's raise a toast
 Cause I've found someone to carry me home tonight..........

;CHORUS

[BREAK]
.D               G        D/F#            A
 Carry me home tonight,   carry me home tonight     x 6
 (Nah nah, nah nah nah nah nah nah...................)

;CHORUS  (drums only)
;CHORUS

.             G            A              Bm        A       G
 So if by the time the bar closes and you feel like falling down, 
.     G         A     (D)
 I'll carry you home tonight......</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.D   C              G        D        C              G
 Big wheels keep on turning, carry me home to see my kin
.D       C               G
 Singing songs about the Southland,
.D         C          G                           (D)
 I miss Alabamy once again, And I think its a sin

[V2]
 Well I heard mister Young sing about her,
 Well, I heard ole Neil put her down
 Well, I hope Neil Young will remember,
 A Southern man don't need him around anyhow
 
[C]
.D     C       G     D         C            G
 Sweet home Alabama, where the skies are so blue
.D     C       G     D         C              G   
 Sweet home Alabama, Lord, I'm coming home to you
 SOLO 1  into normal riff)

[Solo 1]
.(F C/E) D  C  G     D   C   G

[V3]
 In Birmingham they love the governor,
 Now we all did what we could do
 Now Watergate does not bother me,
 Does your conscience bother you? tell the truth
 
[C]

[V4]
 Now muscle shoals has got the swampers
 And they've been known to pick a song or two
 Lord they get me off so much,
 They pick me up when I'm feeling blue, how about you?

[Solo 2]

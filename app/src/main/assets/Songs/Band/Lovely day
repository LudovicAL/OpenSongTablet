  <lyrics>[V1]
.E                     C#m7         
 When I wake up in the morning love
.Amaj7                   C  B
 And the sun it hurts my eyes
.E                     C#m7         
 And something without warning love
.Amaj7              C   B
 Weighs heavy on my mind
.C/D                D               C/D              D
 Then I look at you and the world's all right with me
.C/D                  D              C/D     D
 Just one look at you and I know its gonna be

[C]
.         E               C#m7        Amaj7   C B
 A lovely day (Lovely day lovely day ............)
.         E               C#m7        Amaj7   C B
 A lovely day (Lovely day lovely day ............)

[V2]
 When the day that lies ahead of me
 Seems impossible to face
 When Someone else instead of me
 Always seems to know the way
 Then I look at you and the world's all right with me
 Just one look at you and I know its gonna be

.Emaj7   F#m   Emaj7   F#m 

[V1]
.Emaj7         F#m 
 Hey, have you ever tried 
.Emaj7                       F#m 
 Really reaching out for the other side  
.A                    G#m          F#m            F#m/B 
 I may be climbing on rainbows but baby here goes 
.Emaj7          F#m 
 Dreams are for those who sleep 
.Emaj7       F#m 
 Life is for us to keep 
.A                                 G#m             C# 
 And if you're wondering what this song is leading to 
.F#m/B                Emaj7    F#m 
 I wanna make it with you 
.                             Emaj7       A   E/G#   F#m   B 
 I really think that we could make it girl 

[V2]
 Though you don't know me well       
 In every little thing, only time will tell 
 If you believe the things that I do when we'll see it through 
 Life can be short or long , love can be right or wrong 
 And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through 
 I'd like to make it with you 
 I really think that we could make it girl 

[GUITAR]
.Emaj7    F#m    Emaj7    F#m  
.A        G#m    F#m      F#m/B  
                          Baby you know that 

[V3]
 Dreams are for those who sleep 
 Life is for us to keep 
 And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through 
 I'd like to make it with you 
 I really think that we could make it girl

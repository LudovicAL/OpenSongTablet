  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E (riff that continues for most of the song)

[V1]
.       E
 Once I was a funky singer playin' in a Rock and Roll Band
 I never had no problems, yeah, burnin' down one night stands
 And everything around me, yeah
 Got to stop to feelin' so low 
 And I decided quickly (Yes I did)
 To disco down and check out the show
.               E.....
 Yeah, they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
 And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted

[C]
.G
 Play that funky music white boy
 Play that funky music right
.                      Bb
 Play that funky music white boy
 Lay down the boogie
.                                   E
 And play that funky music till you die

[V2]
 I tried to understand this
 I thought that they were out of their minds
 How could I be so foolish (How could I)
 To not see I was the one behind
 So still I kept on fighting, well, loosing every step of the way
 I said, I must go back there (I got to go back)
 And check to see if things still the same

 Yeah they was dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
 And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted

;Chorus

[V3]
 (Hey, wait a minute)  Now first it wasn't easy
 Changin' Rock and Roll and minds 
 And things were getting shaky, I thought I'd have to leave it behind
 But now its so much better (it's so much better)
 I'm funking out in every way
 But I'll never lose that feelin' (no I won't)
 Of how I learned my lesson that day

 When they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
 And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted

;Chorus

[Repeat]
.             G
 They shouted play that funky music (Play that funky music)
.G                           G/B   G/C     G/C#          G/D
 Play that funky music  (You gotta keep on playin' funky music)

[Outro]
.G/B   G/C          G/C#            G/D   x3   E</lyrics>

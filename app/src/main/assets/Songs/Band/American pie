.  G     D/F# Em          Am          C  
 A long, long time ago... I can still remember
.         Em             D
 How that music used to make me smile.
.      G    D/F#  Em                  Am                 C
 And I knew if  I had my chance, that I could make those people dance
.     Em                           D
 And, maybe, they’d be happy for a while.
.    Em       Am              Em               Am
 But February made me shiver, with every paper I’d deliver.
.C        G/B    Am          C                      D
 Bad news on the doorstep; I couldn’t take one more step.
.  G       D/F#      Em             Am7            D
 I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride,
.G          D/F#      Em              C        D7       G   C  G
 Something touched me deep inside the day_ the music  died._____

.   G   C         G        D    
 So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
.         G            C             G         D       
 Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry, 
.     G        C                  G           D
 Them good ole boys were drinkin' whiskey and Rye, singing
.Em                        A7      Em                         D7
 This'll be the day that I die,    This'll be the day that I die.

[V2]
.G                 Am                  C                 Am
 Did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above?
.      Em               D           G      D/F#     Em
 If the Bible tells you so__  Now do you believe in rock and roll?
.   Am              C                 Em                      A7           D7
 Can music save your mortal soul? and can you teach me how to dance_ real slow?
.       Em                  Am                     Em              Am
 Well I know that you're in love with him 'cause I saw you dancing in the gym,
.    C           G/B      A7            C                    D7
 You both kicked off your shoes,  Man I dig those rhythm and blues!
.        G      D/F#     Em                   Am                   C
 I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck, with a pink carnation and a pick-up truck.
.   G      D/F#   Em               C        D7     G  C  G
 But I knew I was out of luck the day, the music died.___
.G           D7
 I started singing....     (chorus)

[V3]
 Now for ten years, we've been on our own and moss grows fat on a rolling stone,
 But that's not how it used to be. Cause when the jester sang for the King &amp; Queen
 In a coat he borrowed from James Dean and a voice that came from you and me
 Oh and while the king was looking down    the jester stole his thorny crown
 The court room was adjourned no verdict was returned.
 And while Lennon read a book on Marx      the quartet practiced in the park
 And we sang dirges in the dark the day__    the music  died__
 I started singin'      (chorus)

[C]

[V4]
 Helter skelter in the summer swelter_ the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
 Eight miles high and falling fast__  it landed foul on the grass
 The players tried for a forward pass with the jester on the sidelines in a cast_
 The half time air was sweet perfume while the seargeants played a marching tune
 We all got up to dance but we never got the chance.   'Cause
 The players tried to take the field, but the marching band refused to yield
 Do you recall what was revealed  _____ the day the music died.
 I started singin'      (chorus)

[C]

[V5]
 And there we were all in one place,  A generation lost in space.
 With no time left, to start again. So come on, Jack be nimble, jack be quick,
 Jack flash sat on a candlestick.   'Cause fire is the devil's only friend.
 And as I watched him on the stage  my hands were clenched in fists of rage.
 No angel born in hell__   could break that satan's spell
 And as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite
 I_ saw Satan laughing with delight,  the day the music died.
 We were singin'     (chorus)

[V6]
.  G     D/F#     Em
 I met a girl who sang the blues so
.  Am                  C            Em                                D
 I asked her for some happy news but she just smiled__    and turned away.
. G     D/F#        Em                      Am              C
 I went down to the sacred store.  Where I heard the music years before.__
.        Em                 C              D
 But the man there said the music wouldn't play.__     And
.Em                  Am                    Em                   Am
 In the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed.
.    C     G/B      Am              C                          D
 But not a word was spoken.__  The church__ bells_ all_ were_ broken.
.         G       D/F#   Em              Am7                 D
 And the three men I   admire most:  the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost__
.     G          D         Em                 C       D7     G   C  G
 They caught the last train for the coast the day, the music died.
 G             D7                              C             D7         G C G
 And they were singing    (chorus twice)

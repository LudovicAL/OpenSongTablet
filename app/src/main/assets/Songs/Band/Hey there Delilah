  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G Bm  x2

[V1]
.G                           Bm
 Hey there Delilah what's it like in New York City?
.      G                               Bm                                Em   D 
 I'm a thousand miles away but girl, tonight you look so pretty, yes you do
.C                  D                  Em               D
 Times Square can't shine as bright as you I swear it's true

[V2]
 Hey there Delilah don't you worry about the distance
 I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, close your eyes
 Listen to my voice, it's my disguise.  I'm by your side

[C]
.G                D     Em D/F#  G                D     Em  D/F#
 Oh it's what you do to me,      Oh it's what you do to me
.G                D     Em D/F#  G                D     Em  D/F#  G
 Oh it's what you do to me,      Oh it's what you do to me

[V3]
 Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard
 But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
 We'll have the life we knew we would,  my word is good

[V4]
 Hey there Delilah, I've got so much left to say
 If every simple song I wrote to you, would take your breath away, I'd write it all
 Even more in love with me you'd fall, we'd have it all

;CHORUS

[MID8]
.  C                                    D
 A thousand miles seems pretty far, But they've got planes and trains and cars
.    G                             Em
 I'd walk to you if I had no other way
.    C                                    D
 Our friends would all make fun of us and we'll just laugh along because 
.   G                                     Em
 We know that none of them have felt this way
.    C                           D
 Delilah I can promise you, that by the time we get through
.    G                                                D
 The world will never ever be the same, and you're to blame

[V5]
 Hey there Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
 Two more years and you'll be done with school and I'll be making history like I do
 You'll know it's all because of you, we can do whatever we want to
 Hey there Delilah here's to you, This ones for you</lyrics>

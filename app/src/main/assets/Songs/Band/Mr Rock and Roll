  <title>Mr Rock and Roll</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.A
 So called Mr. Rock n Roll, he's dancing on his own again
 Talking on his phone again
.                                  D
 To someone who tells him that his balance is low
.                                    A
 He's got nowhere to go, he's on his own again.
 Rock chick of the century is acting like she used to be
 Dancing like there's no-one there, before she ever seemed to care
.    D                                               A
 Now she wouldn't dare, it's so rock and roll to be alone

[C]
.            E    
 And they'll meet one day, far away and say
.Bm
 I wish I was something more
.            E    
 And they'll meet one day, far away and say
.Bm                 E  â€¦..                  (A)
 I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before.

[V2]
 Mrs Black and white she's never seen a shade of grey
 Always something on her mind, every single day
 But now she's lost her way and where does she go from here.
 Mr multicultural sees all that one could see
 He's living proof of someone very different to me
 But now he wants to be free, free so he can see

;CHORUS

[BRIDGE]
.          Bm
 He'll say I wish I knew you
.E                     D                    A
 I wish I met you when time was still on my side
.           Bm
 She'll say I wish I knew you
.E                    D              E
 I wish I loved you before I was his bride.

[V3]
 And so they must depart two many more broken hearts
 But I've seen that all before in TV books and film and more
 And there's a happy ending, every single day.

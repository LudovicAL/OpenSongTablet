  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.B    F#    E     B      x2 

[V1]
.B          D#m  G#m              F# 
 Children behave that's what they say when we're together 
.B                 D#m  G#m              F# 
 And watch how you play they don't understand, and so we're... 
.D#m                        B    D#m                         B 
 Running just as fast as we can, holding on to one another's hand 
.A                                              
 Trying to get away into the night 
.             F# 
 And then you put your arms around me 
.                                            (B)
 And we tumble to the ground and then you say 

[C]
.B              F#       
 I think we're alone now,
.      E                    B 
 There doesn't seem to be anyone around 
.B              F#        
 I think we're alone now, 
.    E                            B    (2x bar break) 
 The beating of our hearts is the only sound 
 
[V2]
 Look at the way we've gotta hide what we re doing 
 Cause what would they say if they ever knew, and so we re... 
 Running just as fast as we can, holding on to one another s hand 
 Trying to get away into the night 
 And then you put your arms around me 
 And we tumble to the ground and then you say

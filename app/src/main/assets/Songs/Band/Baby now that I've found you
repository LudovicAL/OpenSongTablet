 Baby, now that I've found you I won't let you go
.           G/Eb
 I build my world around you

 Baby, baby, when first we met
.  Am                    D7
 I knew in this heart of mine
.G                       A               
 That you were someone I couldn't forget
.  Am                        D7
 I sit'n write and I bide my time.

 Spent my life looking for that somebody
.E          Bm        E    E..Eb..D
 To make me feel like you

 Now you tell me that you want to leave me

 But darling I just can't let you......

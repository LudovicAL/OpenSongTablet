  <lyrics>[Intro]
.D  Em  C  G  

[V1]
 I woke up today with this feeling.
 That better things are coming my way.
 And if the sunshine has a meaning,
 Telling me not to let things get in my way

[P]
 When the rainy days are dying, Gotta keep on, keep on trying
 All the bees and birds are flying, Ahhhh...
 Never let go gotta hold on and, Non-stop 'til the break of dawn and
 Keep on moving, don't stop rocking Ahhhh...

[C]
 Get on up when you're down, baby, take a good look around.
 I know it's not much, But it's okay. We'll Keep on movin' on anyway

[V2]
 Feels like I have should be screaming,
 Trying to get through to my friends.
 Sometimes it feels that life has no meaning,
 But I know things will be alright in the end.

[P]
 When the rainy days are dying, Gotta keep on, keep on trying
 All the bees and birds are flying, Ahhhh...
 Never let go gotta hold on and, Non-stop 'til the break of dawn and
 Keep on moving, don't stop rocking Ahhhh...

[C]
 Get on up when you're down, baby, take a good look around.
 I know it's not much, But it's okay. We'll Keep on movin' on anyway

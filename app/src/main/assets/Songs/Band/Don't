.Fm               Cm                      Dbsus2               Ebsus2
 I met this girl late last year, she said don't you worry if I disappear
 I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
 I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
 But then I jump right in a week later return
 I reckoned she was only looking for a lover to burn
 But I gave her my time for two or three nights
 Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
 I went away for months until our paths crossed again
 She told me I was never looking for a friend
 Maybe you can swing by my room around 10
 Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
 We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM
 Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said

 She's singing AH LAHMLAHLAH  Don't fuck
.        Fm         Cm          Dbsus2           Ebsus2
 with my love  That heart is so cold all over my arms
.Fm              Cm             Dbsus2    Ebsus2
 I don't want to know that name AH LAHMLAHLAH 
.                   Fm       Cm           Dbsus2     Ebsus2   Fm
 Don't fuck with my love,  I told her she knows Take aim and reload
.                 Cm            Dbsus2    Ebsus2
 I don't want to know that name AH LAHMLAHLAH
 
[V2]
 For a couple weeks I only want to see her
 We drink away the days with a take away pizza
 Before a text message is the only way to reach her
 Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
 Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
 And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
 But me and her we make money the same way
 Four cities, two planes the same day
 And those shows have never been what it's about
 Maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
 I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
 But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
 Wish I'd have written it down the way that things played out
 When she was kissing him how? I was confused about
 She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

[V3]
 *Bang Bang Bang* On my hotel door
 I don't even know if she knows what for
 She was crying on my shoulder I already told ya
 Trust and respect is what we do this for
 I never intended to be next
 But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
 And I never saw him as a threat
 Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
 It's not like we were both on tour
 We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
 And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
 But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
 This is not the way you realise what you wanted
 It's a bit too much too late if I' m honest
 All this time god knows I'm singing

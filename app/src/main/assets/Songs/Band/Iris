  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Bm   Bmadd2  Gmaj7   G6   x2

[V1]
.        D          Em      G                  Bm            A           G
 And I'd give up forever to touch you, cause I know that you feel me somehow
.           D          Em          G                   Bm            A             G
 You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be, and I don't want to go home right now

[V2]
 And all I can taste is this moment and all I can breathe is your life
 And sooner or later it's over, I just don't want to miss you tonight

[C]
.      Bm             A        G                Bm               A           G 
 And I don't want the world to see me, 'cause I don't think that they'd understand
.     Bm           A          G              Bm          A          G
 When everything's made to be broken, I just want you to know who I am

[BREAK]
.Bm    Bmadd2     Gmaj7    G6      
.Bm    Bmadd2     Gmaj7    G6  (no extra 2 beats)

[V3]
 And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming, or the moment of truth in your lies
 When everything feels like the movies, yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

[V1]
.     G             Em            C                 G/B
 I am sailing, I am sailing, home again, 'cross the sea
.     Am             Em            Am              G      D7
 I am sailing stormy waters, to be near you, to be free

[V2]
 I am flying, I am flying, like a bird, 'cross the sea
 I am flying passing high clouds, to be near you, to be free

[V3]
 Can you hear me, can you hear me, through the dark night, far away?
 I am dying, forever trying, to be with you, who can say?

[V4]
 Can you hear me, can you hear me, through the dark night, far away?
 I am dying, forever trying, to be with you, who can say?

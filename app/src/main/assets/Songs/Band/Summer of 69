.D x4 Bars 

[Verse 1]
.D                               A  
 I got my first real six-string, Bought it at the five-and-dime 
.D                               A  
 Played it 'til my fingers bled, It was the summer of '69
.D                             A  
 Me and some guys from school, Had a band and we tried real hard.
.D                             A  
 Jimmy quit, Jody got married, I should've known we'd never get far

[Chorus]
.Bm         A              D                     G  
 Oh, when I look back now, That summer seemed to last forever
.Bm       A               D                G  
 And if I had the choice, Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
.Bm             A               D       A        D        A 
 Those were the best days of my life 

[Verse 2]
.D                           A  
 Ain't no use in complainin'  When you've got a job to do
.D                                         A  
 Spent my evening's down at the drive-in,  And that's when I met you, yeah

[Chorus] 
.Bm               A             D                      G   
 Standin' on your mama's porch, You told me that you'd wait forever 
.Bm               A             D                  G  
 Oh, and when you held my hand, I knew that it was now or never
.Bm             A               D          A                             D   A 
 Those were the best days of my life,  Oh, yeah,  Back in the summer of '69, oh.

[Mid 8]
.F           Bb                    C                      Bb/D  
 Man we were killin' time, We were young and restless, We needed to unwind
.F       Bb                  C  
 I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no!

[Theme]
.D      A      D      A 

[Verse 3]
.D                              A                        
 And now the times are changin' Look at everything that's come and gone
.D                                          A  
 Sometimes when I play that old six-string, I think about you, wonder what went wrong

[Chorus]
.Bm               A             D                      G   
 Standin' on your mama's porch, You told me that you'd wait forever
.Bm               A             D                  G 
 Oh, and when you held my hand, I knew that it was now or never
.Bm             A               D          A                             D   A  
 Those were the best days of my life,  Oh, yeah,  Back in the summer of '69, oh.
.                      D       A                        D   A  
 It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah. Me and my baby in '69, oh.
.                                              D   A  
 It was the summer, the summer, the summer of '69, yeah.

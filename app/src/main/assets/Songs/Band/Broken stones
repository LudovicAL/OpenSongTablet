  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Bb    F    Eb    Bb    x2

[V1]
.                  Bb                       F
 Like pebbles on a beach, kicked around, displaced by feet
.     Eb                               Cm7     F
 Like broken stones, all trying to get home
.               Bb                           F
 Like a loser's reach, too slow and short to hit the peaks
.            Eb                   Bb
 So lost and alone, trying to get home

[C]
.                 Eb                                Bb
 As another piece shatters, another little bit gets lost
.                     Gm                 Ab    F
 And what else really matters, at such a cost?

[V2]
.               Bb                           F
 Like a loser's reach, too slow and short to hit the peaks
.            Eb                   Bb
 So lost and alone, trying to get home

[LAST TIME]
.              Eb                  Bb
 Trying to get home, trying to get home
.     Eb                               Bb
 Like broken stones, all trying to get home

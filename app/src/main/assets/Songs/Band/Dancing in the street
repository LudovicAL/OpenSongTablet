.C7
 Callin' out around the world 
 Are you ready for a brand new beat? 
 Summer's here and the time is right 
 For dancin' in the streets 
 They're dancin' in Chicago 
 Down in New Orleans 
 Up in New York City 
.               F
 All we need is music, sweet sweet music, 
 There'll be music everywhere 
.            C
 There'll be swingin' swayin' and records playin',
 Dancin' in the streets 

[C]
.E7
 Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear 
.        Am
 Just as long as you are there 
.            Dm
 So come on, every guy grab a girl 
.G7
 Everywhere around the world 
.                     C7
 Oh yeah, there'll be dancin'
 They're dancin' in the street</lyrics>

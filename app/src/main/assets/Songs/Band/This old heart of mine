  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E   G#m    A   G#m  F#m   B  x2

[V1]
.         E                           G#m 
 This old heart of mine, been broke a thousand times
.              A        G#m            F#m     B
 Each time you break away, feel you're gone to stay
.       E                      G#m
 Lonely nights that come, memories that go
.             A        G#m           F#m      B
 Bringing you back again, hurtin' me more and more
.A           B
 Maybe it is my mistake 
.   G#m                     C#m   B
 To show this love I feel inside
.A                   B
 Cause each day that passes by,
.    F#m          G#m            A         B
 You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going

[C]
.E             G#m           A G#m F#m       B
 Cause, I love you, this old heart weeps for you
.E             G#m           A G#m F#m       B
 Cause, I love you, this old heart weeps for you

[V2]
 I try hard to hide this hurt inside
 This old heart of mine, always keeps me crying
 The way you're treatin' me, leaves me incomplete
 You're here for a day and gone for a week
 But if you leave a hundred times 
 A hundred times I'll take you back
 I am yours whenever you want me
 I'm not proud to shout it and tell the world about it</lyrics>

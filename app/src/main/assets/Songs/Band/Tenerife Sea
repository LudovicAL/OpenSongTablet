.G          G/A     C             G          G/A     C
 You look so wonderful in your dress, I love your hair like that
.G         G/A        C                Em       D             C
 The way it falls on the side of your neck down your shoulders and back
.G        G/A      C                    G         G/A    C
 We are surrounded by all of these lies and people who talk too much
.G             G/A        C                 Em           D           C
 You've got the kind of look in your eyes as if no one knows anything but us
 
[P]
.    C                 G           D     C                     G/B      D
 And should this be the last thing I see, I want you to know it's enough for me
.      C                  G                 D
 Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
 
[C]
.          G  G/A  C       G  G/A  C          G  G/A  C       G  G/A  C
 I'm so in love,         So in love.        I'm so in love,         So in love
 
[V2]
 You look so beautiful in this light your silhouette over me
 The way it brings out the blue in your eyes is the Tenerife Sea 
 And all of the voices surrounding us here, they just fade out when you take a breath
 Just say the word and now we'll disappear, oh, into the wilderness

[P]
 And should this be the last thing I see, I want you to know it's enough for me
 Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
 
[C]
 I'm so in love, so in love.  I'm so in love, so in love

[B]
.Em C   G/B D  Em  C       D
 Lumière darling, Lumière over me  x4

[P]
 And should this be the last thing I see, I want you to know it's enough for me
 Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
 
[C]
 I'm so in love, so in love.  I'm so in love, so in love

[V3]
 You look so wonderful in your dress, I loved your hair like that
.G         G/A    C*
 And in the moment I knew you back

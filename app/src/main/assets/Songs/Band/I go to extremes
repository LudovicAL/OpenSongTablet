  <lyrics>[Intro]
.(C)  Bb   F/A   G   C    x2

[V1]
.C                C/A             C/F                      C
 Call me a joker, call me a fool, right at this moment I'm totally cool
.C                   C/E               F                      C
 Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife, I feel like I'm in the prime of my life
.Bb                          F/A            
 Sometimes it feels like I'm going too fast, 
.C/G                        D/F#
 I don't know how long this feeling will last
.C/G        G    C
 Maybe it's only tonight
 
[C]
.          Bb         F/A G         C
 Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
.            Bb      F/A   G        C
 Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
.         Gm/Bb      A7    Dm                     Fm
 And if I stand or I fall, It's all or nothing at all
.          Bb         F/A G/C     C
 Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
 
[V2]
 Sometimes I'm tired, sometimes I'm shot
 Sometimes I don't know how much more I've got
 Maybe I'm headed over the hill
 Maybe I've set myself up for the kill
 Tell me how much do you think you can take
 Until the heart in you is starting to break?
 Sometimes it feels like it will

[C2]
 Darling I don't know why I go to extremes
 Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
 You can be sure when I'm gone, I won't be out there too long
 Darling I don't know why I go to extremes

[Mid 8]
.Dm                   Bb              F                        C
 Out of the darkness, into the light, Leaving the scene of the crime
.Dm                  Bb                    C
 Either wrong or I'm perfectly right every time
.Am               F              C                   G
 Sometimes I lie awake, night after night coming apart at the seams
.Dm               Bb              F              C
 Eager to please, ready to fight, why do I go to extremes?

[KEYBOARD SOLO]
.          Bb         F/A G         C
.          Bb         F/A G         C

.Gm/Bb               A7    Dm                     Fm
 And if I stand or I fall, It's all or nothing at all
.          Bb         F/A G/C     C
 Darling I don't know why I go to extremes

[C4]
 No I don't know why I go to extremes
 Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens
 You can be sure when I'm gone, I won't be out there too long
 Darling I don't know why I go to extremes

[OUTRO]
;(as Intro)
 I don't know why...I don't know why...
 I don't know why...I don't know why...
 Out in the dark...into the light...
 Either I'm wrong...perfectly right
.          Bb         F/A G/C     C
 Darling I don't know why I go to extremes

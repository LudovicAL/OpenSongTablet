  <lyrics>[V1]
.          B
 Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
.  F#  
 I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
.  G#m                                                  E
 I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back

[V2]
 Before the cool dawn run out I'll be giving it my bestest
 And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
 I reckon, it's again my turn to win some or learn some.

[C]
 But I won't hesitate, no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm yours.

[V3]
 Well, open up your mind and see like me,
 Open up your plans and damn you're free.
 Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
 Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
.                                       E                          C#/F
 And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

[C]
 So I won't hesitate, no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm sure.
 There's no need to complicate, our time is short. This is our fate, I'm yours.

[Mid8]
.B    F#/A#     G#m                     F#              E        
 Do...do...do...do you want to come on, scootch on over closer, dear
.C#/F
 And I will nibble your ear    x2 (ad lib)

[V3]
 I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
 And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
 But my breath fogged up the glass and so I drew a new face and I laughed.

[V4]
 I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
 To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
 It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue.

[C]
 But I won't hesitate, no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm yours.

[V5]
 Well, open up your mind and see like me,
 Open up your plans and damn you're free.
 Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
 So please don't, please don't, please don't...
 There's no need to complicate.
 'Cause our time is short.
 This oh, this oh, this is our fate.  I'm yours.

[Outro]
 Oh, I'm yours, Oh, I'm yours
 Oh, oh, Baby, do you believe, I'm yours?
 You best believe, you best believe, I'm yours.</lyrics>

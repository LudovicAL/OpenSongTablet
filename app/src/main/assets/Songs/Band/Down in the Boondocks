.F#m  B  F#m  B  A  B  C#m  B

[C]
.E                      A
 Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks
.B                         A                             E
 People put me down 'cause that's the side of town I was born in
.E                                A
 I love her and she loves me, But I don't fit her society
.B                     A                    E
 Lord have mercy, on a boy from down in the boondocks

[V1]
.E                                            A      B       E
 Now, every night I watch the lights from the house upon the hill
.        E                      B                    Abm            C#m   B
 Well, I love a little girl who lives up there and I guess I always will
.    A                  B                      A                B
 But I don't dare knock on her door 'Cause her daddy is my boss man
.   A                 B              A                  B 
 So I'll just have to be content and see her whenever I can, Take a trip on...

[C]
.E                      A
 Down in the boondocks, Down in the boondocks
.B                         A                             E
 People put me down 'cause that's the side of town I was born in,  See...
.E                                A
 I love her and she loves me, But I don't fit her society
.B                     B                    E
 Lord have mercy, on a boy from down in the boondocks

[V2]
.E                                A         B        E
 One fine day I'll find a way and move from this old shack
.           E               B                    Abm                    C#m  B 
 Well, I'll hold my head up like a king and I'll never, never will look back 
.A                      B                   A               B
 'Til that morning I'll work and slave, and I'll save every dime
.      A                    B              A               B
 But tonight she'll have to steal away, to see me one more time, Get together, darling...

;Chorus x2

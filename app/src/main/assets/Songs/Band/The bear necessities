  <lyrics>[C]
.             F      F7
 Look for the bear necessities
.    Bb
 The simple bear necessities
.   F    Eb        D7               G7    C
 Forget about your worries and your strife
.           F      F7
 I mean the bear necessities
.   Bb              Bbm
 Of mother nature's recipes
.     Eb        D7     G7   C       F
 That bring the bear necessities of life

[V1]
.           C7                 F
 Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
.              C7               F
 I couldn't be fonder of my big home
.             Bb             Bbm
 The bees are buzzin' in the tree
.             F              G7
 To make some honey just for me
.     Dm7..              D7..
 When you look under the rocks and plants
.    Gm..                 C7
 And take a glance at the fancy ants
.     F     Cm/Eb   D7..
 Then maybe try   a few
.           Gm           C7                F
 The bear necessities of life will come to you

[V2]
 When you pick a paw-paw or prickly pear
 And you prick a wrong paw, next time beware
 Don't pick a prickly pear by the paw
 When you pick a pear try to use the claw
 But you don't need to use the claw
 When you pick a pear of the big paw paw
 Have I given you a clue?
 The bear necessities of life will come to you</lyrics></song>

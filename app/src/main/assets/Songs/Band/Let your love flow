.D    G    D    G

[V1]
.             D                        G
 Oh there's a reason, for the sunshine sky
.             D                         G
 Oh there's a reason why I'm feeling so high
.            A
 Must be the season
.                                D        G
 When that love light shines all around us

[V2]
 So let that feeling grab you deep inside
 And send your reeling where your love can't hide
 And then those feelings through the moonlight night
 With your lover
 
[C]
.D7/C          G
 Just let your love flow, like a mountain stream
 Let your love fly, like a bird on the wing
          D
 Let your love grow with the smallest of dreams
 Let your love bind you to all living things
          A
 Let your love show, and you'll know what I mean
 And let your love shine, and you'll know what I mean
          D
 It's the season
 That's the reason

[V3]
 And there's a reason for the warm sweet nights
 And there's a reason for the candle lights
 Must be the season
 When those love lights shine all around us

[V4]
 So let that wonder take you into space
 And lay you under it's loving embrace
 Just feel the thunder as it warms your face
 You can't hold back

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.E	Bm	A	A/G#    A/F#    A/E	x2	

[V1]
.E                      C#m
 I can't sleep tonight, everybody saying everything's alright
.E                            C#m
 Still I can't close my eyes, I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
.A     B     A              B
 Sunny days, where have you gone
.  A       E/G#      F#m A/E       B 
 I get the strangest feeling you belong

[C]
.E                  B
 Why does it always rain on me,
.A	E/G#	 F#m             A/E
 Is it because I lied when I was seventeen
.E                  B
 Why does it always rain on me, 
.A             E/G#           F#m      A/E
 Even when the sun is shining I can't avoid the lightning

[V2]
 I can't stand myself, I'm being held up by invisible men
 Still life on a shelf when I got my mind on something else
 Sunny days, where have you gone
 I get the strangest feeling you belong

[C]	
;Why does it always.......

[B]	
.C#m              E/B	        
 Oh where did the blue skies go, 
.C#m           E/B      D  A/C# Bm A  B
 And why is it raining so,   it's so cold

[V3]
 I can't sleep tonight, everybody saying everything's alright
 Still I can't close my eyes, I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
 Sunny days, where have you gone
 I get the strangest feeling you belong

[C]	
;Why does it always.......

[B]	
 Oh where did the blue skies go, 
 And why is it raining so,   it's so cold

[C]	
;Why does it always.......

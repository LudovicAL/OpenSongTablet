  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G     C   D      G     C  D

[V1]
.G                       C                 D
 Another turning point a fork stuck in the road,
.G                                C                    D  
 Time grabs you by the wrist, and directs you where to go
.Em          D            C                  G
 So make the best of this test and don't ask why
.Em         D              C                 G
 It's not a question but a lesson learned in time
.    Em             G            Em              G             
 Its something unpredictable but in the end it's right
.  Em               D            G   (all in as intro)
 I hope you had the time of your life.

[BREAK]
.G     C   D      G     C  D

[V2]
 Take the photographs and still frames in your mind
 Hang it on a shelf and in good health and good time
 Tattoos the memories and this test go on trial
 For what it's worth it was worth all the while
 Its something unpredictable but in the end it's right
 I hope you had the time of your life.

 Its something unpredictable but in the end it's right
.  Em               D            G
 I hope you had the time of your life.

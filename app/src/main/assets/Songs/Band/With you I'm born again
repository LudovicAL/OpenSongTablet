  <lyrics>[V1]
.     Em            Bm7 
 Come bring me your softness 
.Am7/C                       Bm7 
 Comfort me through all this madness 
.Am7                       Bm7           E 
 Woman don't you know with you I'm born again 

[V2]
.     Em           Bm7 
 Come give me your sweetness 
.Am7/C                       Bm7 
 Now there's you there is no weakness 
.Am7                    Bm7            E 
 Lying safe within your arms I'm born again 

[Mid 8]
.Am7             Bm7 
 I was half, not whole 
.  Am7/C      Bm7 
 Instead with none 
.Am7                   Bm7 
 Reaching through this world 
.   F    Em Dm7 
 In need of one 

[V3]
.     Em           Bm7 
 Come show me your kindness 
.Am7/C                    Bm7 
 In your arms I know I'll find this 
.Am7                       Bm7           E 
 Woman don't you know with you I'm born again 
.Am7                     Bm7           E 
 Lying safe with you I'm born ....... again</lyrics>

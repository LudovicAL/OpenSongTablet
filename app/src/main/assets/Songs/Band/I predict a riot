  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.Cm  Eb  D   Cm  Eb  D  Ab  G   F  Eb  D        x2 

[V1]
.Cm                           Eb       F                 Cm
 Ohhh watching the people get lairy is not very pretty I tell thee
.Cm                            Eb        F                 Cm
 Walking through town is quite scary and not very sensible either
.Cm                          Eb        F                         Cm
 A friend of a friend he got beaten he looked the wrong way at a policeman
.Cm                           Eb           F
 Would never have happened to Smeaton, and old Leodiensian 

[P]
.Cm    Cm/B Eb/Bb        F         Cm     C/B Eb/Bb        F 
 La-ah-ah,  la la lalala la  Ah-ah-ah, la la  lalala la la la

[C] 
.Ab                Db          Ab    Ab                Db          Ab
 I predict a riot, I predict a riot, I predict a riot, I predict a riot 

[V2]
 I tried to get in my taxi, a man in a tracksuit attacked me
 He said that he saw it before me, Wants to get things a bit gory
 Girls run around with no clothes on, 
 To borrow a pound for a condom
 If it wasn't for chip fat, well they'd be frozen, 
 They're not very sensible 

;PRECHORUS La-ah-ah....
;CHORUS I predict a riot...

[T]
.               D               C         Bb                     Ab
 And if there's anybody left in here that doesn't want to be out there.... 

[INSTRUMENTAL]
.Cm  Eb  D  Cm  Eb  D  Ab  G  F  Eb  D     x2

[V3]
 Watching the people get lairy is not very pretty I tell thee
 Walking through town is quite scary and not very sensible 

;PRECHORUS La-ah-ah....
;CHORUS I predict a riot...

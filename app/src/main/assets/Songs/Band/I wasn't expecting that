  <lyrics>[Intro]
.C / Em / Am / G / F / G / C / Am G / 

[V1]
.C Em Am G 
 It was only a smile but my heart it went wild
.F G C Am G 
 And I wasn't expecting that
.C Em Am G 
 Just a delicate kiss, anyone could've missed 
.F G C G 
 I wasn't expecting that 

[V2]
 Did I misread the sign? Your hand slipped into mine
 I wasn't expecting that
 You spent the night in my bed, you woke up and you said 
 "Well, I wasn't expecting that"

[C]
.Dm Em E7 
 I thought love wasn't meant to last,
.F G C 
 I thought you were just passing through 
.Am Em 
 If I ever get the nerve to ask
.F G G7 
 What did I get right to deserve somebody like you?
.C 
 I wasn't expecting that

[V3]
 It was only a word, it was almost mis-heard
 'Cause I wasn't expecting that
 But it came without fear, a month turned into a year
 And I wasn't expecting that 

;Chorus

[Instrumental]
.C / Em / Am / G / F / G / C / C / G (Ab)

[B]
.Am 
 Isn't it strange how a life can be changed
.F G C 
 in the flicker of the sweetest smile 
.G Ab 
 We were married in spring 
.Am 
 You know I wouldn't change a thing 
.F G G7 
 Without an innocent kiss, what a life I'd have missed, 

[V4]
 If you'd not took a chance on a little romance 
 When I wasn't expecting that 
 Time doesn't take long, three kids up and gone
 And I wasn't expecting that 

[V5]
 And when the nurses they came, said its come back again
 I wasn't expecting that 
 Then you closed your eyes, took my heart by surprise 
 And I wasn't expecting that

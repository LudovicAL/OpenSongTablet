  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.G   G/B   C   D      x2

[V1]
.     G                         Cmaj7               D9 
 I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight 
.     B7                      Em      D     C 
 I've never seen you shine so bright, mm mm mm mm 
.     G                      Cmaj7                    D 
 I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance 
.        B7                     Em           G7     C 
 They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance 
.           Am                           
 And I have never seen that dress you're wearing 
        D7                                      Em 
 Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes 
.            D  
 I have been blind 

[C]
.    D/C     G G/B C9    D            Em  D/F#     Em 
 The lady in red .... is dancing with me, cheek to cheek 
.        Em/D   Am  D7                    G                      G7 
 There's nobody here... it's just you and me, It's where I wanna be 
.             C     B/Eb B            Em  Em/D  Cmaj7 
 But I hardly know, this beauty by my side 
.              Am7  D                   (G   G/B   C   D) x2 
 I'll never forget, the way you looked tonight 

[V2]
 I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
 I've never seen you shine so bright, you were amazing 
 I've never seen so many people wanna be there by your side 
 And when you turned to me and smiled, it took my breath away 
 And I have never had such a feeling 
 Such a feeling of complete and utter love as I do tonight 

;CHORUS Repeat last line using : 
.Em Em/D Cmaj7 instead of riff

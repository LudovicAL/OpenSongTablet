  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.C  F  C  F

[V1]
.C     F    C          F         Dm7
 Every time I close my eyes it's you
.           F         C   Am7         F                G
 And I know now who I am, yeah, yeah, yeah, and I know now

[C]
.C                             G
 There's a place I go when I'm alone
.                                Am7
 Do anything I want, be anyone I wanna be
.Am7                    F
 But it is us I see and I cannot believe I'm falling
.C        
 That's where I'm going, where are you going?
.G                             Am
 Hold it close, won't let this go
.Am             F                          Dm
 Dream catch me yeah dream catch me when I fall
.F                            C
 Or else I won't come back at all

[V2]
 You do so much, but you don't know it's true
 And I know now who I am, yeah, yeah, yeah, and I know now

;CHORUS

[Mid 8]
.Am           F                       C
 See you as a mountain, a fountain of God
.            G                    Am
 See you as a descant soul in the setting sun
.         F                       C     G
 You as a sound just as silent as none, I'm yours

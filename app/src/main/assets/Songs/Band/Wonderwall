.F#m   A   Esus4   B7sus4     x4

[V1]
.F#m      A                             Esus4                  B7sus4
 Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
.F#m        A                  Esus4                   B7sus4
 By now you shoulda somehow realised what you've gotta do
.F#m                  A       Esus4           B7sus4 
 I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do 
.          F#m   A   Esus4   B7sus4
 About you now       

[V2]
 Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
 I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
 I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[B]
.    D                E                F#m 
 And all the roads we have to walk are winding
.    D                   E                 F#m 
 And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
.D              E                   A       E/G#   F#m
 There are many things that I would like to say to you
.                 A/E    B7sus4 
 But I don't know how

[C]
.      D F#m A       F#m                       D F#m A F#m 
 Cause maybe, you're gonna be the one that saves me
.          D F#m A        F#m   D  F#m A (F#m ........)
 And after all, you're my wonderwall

[V3]
 Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you 
 By now, you shoulda somehow realised what you've not to do
 I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

.Bb     Gm       Ebmaj7        F         
 Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for
.     Bb       Gm          Dm    F 
 Your touch, a long lonely time
.    Bb        Gm    Ebmaj7      F 
 And time goes by so slowly, and time can do
.   Bb        Gm        Dm     F 
 So much, are you still mine?

[B]
.  Bb        F    Gm7 Dm7
 I need your love, I  need your love
.    Eb         F       Bb   (Bb7)
 God speed your love to me

[C]
.Eb            F            Eb       Db 
 Lonely rivers flow, to the sea, the sea
.Eb          F           Bb 
 To the open arms of the sea
.Eb            F              Eb           Db
 Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me
.Eb             F             Bb
 I'll be coming home wait for me

[V2]
 Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for
 Your touch, a long lonely time
 And time goes by so slowly, and time can do
 So much, are you still mine?

[B]
 I need your love, I need your love
 God speed your love to me</lyrics></song>

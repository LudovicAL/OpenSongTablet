  <title>Beautiful body</title>
  <lyrics>[INTRO.]
.Fm     Bb    Eb

[C]
.     Bb7 
 If I said you had a beautiful body 
.                   Eb 
 Would you hold it against me? 
.     Bb7 
 If I swore you were an angel 
.                                    Eb 
 Would you treat me like the devil tonight? 
.         Bb7 
 If I was dying of thirst 
.                                 Eb        Cm 
 Would your flowing love come and quench me? 
.     Ab                       Bb7 
 If I said you had a beautiful body 
.                   Eb 
 Would you hold it against me? 

[V1]
.Eb                                Ab 
 We could talk all night about the weather 
.Fm7                                      Bb  Fm7  Bb 
 Tell you all about my friends out on the coast 
.Eb                         Ab 
 I could ask a lot of crazy questions 
.Fm7                 Bb7            Eb 
 Or ask you what you really want to know 

[C]

[V2] 
 Rain can fall so soft against the window 
 Sun can shine so bright up in the sky 
 Daddy always said son don't give small talk 
 Come right out and say what's on your mind

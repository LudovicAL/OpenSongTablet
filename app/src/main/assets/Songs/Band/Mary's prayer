  <lyrics>[V1]
.              F          G             G/A    Am
 Everything is wonderful, being here is heavenly
.             F       G                    G/A   Am
 Every single day she sings, everything is free
.                F         G                G/A  Am
 I used to be so careless, as if I couldn't care less
.              F                    G            C
 Did I have to make this mess, when I was Mary's prayer?

[V2]
 Suddenly the heavens rolled, suddenly the rains came down
 Suddenly was washed away, the Mary that I knew     
 So hard to find somebody who could think of me and celebrate
 I made such a big mistake, when I was Mary's prayer

[C]
.              F    G   Em   Am  F                  C 
 So if I sing "save me, save me, be the light in my eyes"       
.             F   G    Em Am  F                   Bb      (G to repeat chorus)
 And if I say ten hail Marys, Leave a light on in heaven for me

[V3]
 Blessed is the one who shares the power and your beauty Mary
 Blessed is the willing, Mary, who shares your wedding day
 So hard to find somebody who could think of me and celebrate
 I made such a big mistake, when I was Mary's prayer

;CHORUS  x2 (2nd Time is solo)                       

[B]
.                F              G                    G/A    Am 
 If you want the fruit to fall, you have to give the tree a shake
.                 F        G                         G/A   Am
 If you shake the tree too hard, the bow is going to break        
.               Dm                   Bb                G/A        Am
 And if I can't reach the top of the tree Mary you can hold me up there
.                F               G            C  
 What I wouldn't give to be when I was Mary's prayer

;CHORUS  x2

[OUTRO]
.F    G   Em   Am  F                  C
 Save me, save me, be the light in my eyes
.                F               G            C 
 What I wouldn't give to be when I was Mary's prayer    x3</lyrics>

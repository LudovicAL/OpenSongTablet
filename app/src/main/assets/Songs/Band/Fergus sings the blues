  <title>Fergus sings the blues</title>
  <lyrics>[V1]
.F                      Gm                   Eb
 Fergus sings the blues in bars of twelve or less
.      F                     Gm            Eb
 I'm a stranger to the land, to this wilderness     	
.Bb/G           F/A       Bb                  F/A     	
 All things are possible, but happen less and less         
.Bb/G       F/A      Bb           C     	
 This is my country, these are my reasons        

[C]
.Bb      Cm   Bb     F      Bb     Cm     Bb   F
 Cause I look in the mirror and it throws back questions     
.Bb    Cm      Bb F      Bb   Cm  Bb F
 And I whisper in words, that beg an answer    		               
.         Eb Bb Eb Bb Eb Bb  Eb   Bb  F     Gm    Eb
 Tell me, can this white man sing the blues

[V2]
 Home sick James, my biggest influence
 Tell me why, James and Bobby purify     	
 I'm lost in music, sweet soul music     	
 This is my country, these are my reasons

[C x2]    

[BREAK]
;As main riff

[Mid 8]             
.         Bb/G                F/A	
 From the north coast, to the uplands	
.Bb                           F/A          	
 Stay on the left side of the white line	                 
.         Bb/G           F/A          	
 From the campsides over Christmas	
.Bb               C          	
 I still dream of Memphis     

[C2]
.Bb      Cm   Bb     F	    Bb     Cm     Bb   F
 Cause I look in the mirror and it throws back questions    
.Bb    Cm      Bb F     Bb   Cm  Bb F
 And I whisper in words that beg an answer 
.Bb Cm              Bb   F   Bb Cm              Bb   F       
    I got the blue, blue world, I see the blue, blue sky
.Bb Cm              Bb   F   Bb Cm          Bb   F       
    I got the blue, blue ocean, in my blue, blue eye
.            Eb Bb Eb Bb Eb Bb  Eb   Bb  F       
 So tell me, can this white man sing the blues</lyrics>

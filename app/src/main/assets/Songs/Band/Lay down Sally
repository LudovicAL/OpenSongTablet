  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                                                               D
 There is nothing that is wrong in wanting you to stay here with me
.  A
 I know you've got somewhere to go but won't you make yourself at home
.    D                           E
 And stay with me, and don't you ever leave

[C]
.A                    D
 Lay down, Sally, and rest you in my arms
.E                                   A
 Don't you think you want someone to talk to
.A                   D
 Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
.E                                       A
 I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

[V2]
.A                                                                    D
 The sun ain't nearly on the rise and we still got the moon and stars above
.     A
 Underneath the velvet skies, love is all that matters
.          D                           E
 Won't you stay with me, and don't you ever leave

;Chorus

[V3]
.A                                                      D
 I long to see the morning light colouring your face so dreamily
.   A
 So don't you go and say goodbye, you can lay your worries down
.    D                           E
 And stay with me, and don't you ever leave

;Chorus

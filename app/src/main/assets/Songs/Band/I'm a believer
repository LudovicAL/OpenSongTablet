[V1]
.G                  D            G
 I thought love was only true in fairy tales,
.G                 D                G
 Meant for someone else but not for me
.C               G          C                 G
 Love was out to get to me, that's the way it seems
.C              G              D7
 Disappointment haunted all my dreams

[C]
.                   G  C  G   C       G   C   G
 And then I saw her face, now I'm a believer, 
.C     G   C  G  C           G  C   G 
 Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
.C      G            C       G
 I'm in love, ooohh, I'm a believer, 
.           F              D7
 I couldn't leave her if I tried

[V2]
 I thought love was more or less a given thing
 Seems the more I gave the less I got
 What's the use in trying, all you get is pain
 When I wanted sunshine, I got rain

[C]

[GUITAR]

[B]
 What's the use in trying, all you get is pain
 When I wanted sunshine, I got rain

  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.C	D7	F	C  (for most of song)

[C]
 I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love 
 And I'm like, Forget You! Oo, oo, ooo
 I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough, 
 I'm like, forget you and forget her too!
 I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya, 
 Ha, ain't that some sh........?
 Although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best with a...
 Forget You! Oo, oo, ooo

[V1]
 Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari,
 But that don't mean I can't get you there.
 I guess he's an x-Box and I'm more Atari, 
 But the way you play your game ain't fair.
 I pity the fool that falls in love with you, oh (oh she's a gold digger) 
 Well, 						 (just thought you should know yeah)
 Ooooh, I've got some news for you, yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend

[C]

[V2]
 Now I know, that I had to borrow, beg and steal and lie and cheat.
 Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya 
 'Cause being in love with your a$$ ain't cheap.
 I pity the fool that falls in love with you, oh (oh she's a gold digger) 
 Well, 						 (just thought you should know yeah)
 Ooooooh, I've got some news for you,  I really hate you  right now!

[C]

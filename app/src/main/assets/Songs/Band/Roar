  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.D         A/E  …..  

[V1]
.D
 I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
.D                                  A/E  Bm
 Scared to rock the boat and make a mess, 
.Bm                         A/C#
 So I sat quietly, agreed politely
.D
 I guess that I forgot I had a choice
.D                          A/E       Bm
 I let you push me past the breaking point
.Bm                                 A/C#
 I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
.    D                                                    A/E
 You held me down, but I got up, already brushing off the dust
.    Bm                                                     A/C#
 You hear my voice, you hear that sound, like thunder gonna shake your ground
.    D                                               A/E
 You held me down, but I got up get ready cause I've had enough
.  Bm
 I see it all, I see it now

[C]
.                A/C# D                                    A/E
 I got the eye of the tiger, the fire, dancing through the fire
.      Bm                               A/C#    D
 Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
.D                     A/E      
 Louder, louder than a lion
.      Bm                  A/C#                 D
 Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me ROAR
.D             A/E     Bm                          A/C#    D    …..
 (Uh uh uh uh.................)       You’re gonna hear me roar

[V2]
 Now I’m floating like a butterfly, stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
 I went from zero, to my own hero
 You held me down, but I got up, already brushing off the dust
 You hear my voice, you hear that sound, like thunder gonna shake your ground
 You held me down, but I got up get ready cause I’ve had enough
 I see it all, I see it now

;CHORUS

[BRIDGE]
.D...               A/E...  Bm...     A
 Roar-or, roar-or, roar-or, Roar-or, roar-or

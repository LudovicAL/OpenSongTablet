  <lyrics>[Intro]
.Dm7 G7    (4x)
 Doh, doh, doh......
 
[V1]
.Dm7 
 This hit, that ice cold Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
 This one, for them hood girls them good girls, straight masterpieces
 Stylin', while in, livin' it up in the city
 Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent Gotta kiss myself I'm so pretty

[B]
.        Dm7                      G7
 I'm too hot (hot damn), call the police and the fireman
 I'm too hot (hot damn), make a dragon wanna retire man
 I'm too hot (hot damn), say my name you know who I am
 I'm too hot (hot damn), am I bad 'bout that money - Break it down
.Dm7                        Dm7
 Girls hit you, hallelujah, Girls hit you, hallelujah 
 Girls hit you, hallelujah  'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
 'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you  'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to you
.Dm7                                G7
 Saturday night and we in the spot, don't believe me just watch (come on)
 
[C]
.Dm7   G7      Dm7
 Doh, doh, doh  Do, do (don't believe me, just watch)
 Hey, hey, hey, oh!
 
[V2]
 Stop, wait a minute, fill my cup put some liquor in it
 Take a sip, sign a cheque, Julio! Get the stretch!
 Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
 If we show up, we gon' show out smoother than a fresh dry skippy

;Bridge
;Chorus
 
[V3]
 Before we leave, I'm a tell y'all a lil' something
 Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
 Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
 I said Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
 Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
 
[B2]
 Come on, dance, jump on it, If you sexy then flaunt it
 If you freaky than own it, don't brag about it, come show me
 Come on, dance, jump on it, if you sexy then flaunt it
 Well it's Saturday night and we in the spot, don't believe me just watch
 
;Chorus

[T]
.Dm7                 G7                  
 Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up

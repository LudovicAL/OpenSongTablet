.Am                       E7
 Infra-red to see me move through the night
.Am             Dm7
 Aim gonna fire shoot me right

 Iâ€™m gonna like the way you fight (I love the way you fight)

 To wash away my lonely blues
 So I can't deny or lie cause you're 
 The only one to make me fly (You know what you are, you are a)

[C]
 Sexbomb sexbomb you're a sexbomb uh, huh
 You can give it to me when I need to come along (give it to me)
 Sexbomb sexbomb you're my sexbomb
 And baby you can turn me on (baby you can turn me on)

;ORGAN FILL (AS INTRO)

[V3]
 No don't get me wrong ain't gonna do you no harm (no)
 This bomb's made for lovin' and you can shoot it far
 I'm your main target come 
 And help me ignite (ow)

[V4]
 Love struck holding you tight (hold me tight darlin')
 Make me explode although you know the route to go
 To sex me slow and yes I must react 
 To claims of those who say that you are not all that 

[Chorus x2]

  <lyrics>[V1]
.  G
 I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today.....  yeh,
.    G7                                  Am D
 The girl that's driving me mad is going away.

[C]
.Em                    C     Em                    F
 She's got a ticket to ride, she's got a ticket to ride,
.Em                    D7                  G
 She's got a ticket to ride, but she don't care.

[V2]
 She said that living with me is bringing her down ..... yeh,
 For she would never be free when I was around.

;CHORUS    

[Mid 8]
.  C7             
 I don't know why she's riding so high,
.                                                   D
 She ought to think right, she ought to do right by me.
.  C7  
 Before she gets to saying goodbye,
.                                                   D
 She ought to think right, she ought to do right by me.

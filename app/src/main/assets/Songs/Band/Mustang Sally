 Mustang Sally, I guess you better slow that mustang down                 
.        F                                                  C  
 Mustang Sally now baby, guess you better slow that mustang down
.            G                     F.......  
 You've been running all over town                                              
.                                                     C

 All you want to do is ride around Sally â€¦ Ride Sally ride

 All you want to do is ride around Sally ... Ride Sally ride
.G                           F.......
 One of these early mornings
.                                  C
 I'm gonna be wiping those weeping eyes   (Yeah) 

[V2]
 I bought you a brand new mustang, it was a 1965 
 And now you come around girl, to signify a woman  
 Girl you won't, girl you won't let me ride  
 Mustang Sally now baby, guess you better slow that mustang down  
 You've been running all over town  
 Oooh....I guess you better put your flat feet on the ground 

;Chorus

[Outro]

 Those weeping eyes, those weeping eyes ..... (REPEAT)</lyrics>

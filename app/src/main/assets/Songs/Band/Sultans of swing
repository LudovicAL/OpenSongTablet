.Dm   x8

[V1]
.          Dm                      C              Bb   A
 You get a shiver in the dark it's raining in the park meantime
.Dm                      C            Bb        A 
 South of the river, you stop and you hold everything
.  F                            C 
 A band is blowing Dixie double four time
.Bb                                        Dm   Bb C
 You feel alright when you hear that music ring
.           Dm                  C         Bb       A 
 Oh now you step inside but you don't see too many faces
.Dm                   C                Bb      A 
 Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
.F                             C 
 Too much competition in other places
.Bb                                    Dm     Bb    C
 Oh but the horns they're blowing that sound‑.........
.                Bb C                  (Dm   C ' Bb  C) x2
 Way on down south, way on down south, London town

[V2]
.              Dm             C   Bb   A  
 You check out guitar George, he knows all the chords
.Dm                         C                Bb      A 
 Mind he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't wanna make it cry or sing
.F                        C 
 He said an old guitar is all he can afford
.Bb                                           Dm   Bb  C
 When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
.Dm                C    Bb            A 
 And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
.Dm                 C         Bb      A 
 He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
.F                               C 
 He can play the honky tonk like anything
.Bb                      Dm           Bb      C
 Saving it up for friday night‑................
.               Bb C                  (Dm  C ' Bb  C ) x2
 With the Sultans, with the Sultans of Swing          

[V3]
.      Dm                          C       Bb            A 
 And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
.Dm                              C             Bb                 A 
 Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles 
.F                                C 
 They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band  
.Bb                               Dm           Bb   C
 It ain't what they call rock and roll................
.             Bb  C                      (Dm  C ' Bb   C) x2
 And the Sultans, yeah the Sultans played Creole

;INSTRUMENTAL AS VERSE

[V4]
.Dm                   C           Bb        A 
 And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
.Dm           C                 Bb        A 
 And says 'at last' just as the time bell rings
.F                    C 
 'Goodnight, now it's time to go home'
.Bb                                 Dm        Bb    C
 And he makes it fast with one more thing ............
.                 Bb C                    (Dm  C '  Bb   C) x2
 We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of swing

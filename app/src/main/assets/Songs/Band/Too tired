[V1]
 I laid down last night, too tired to wake
 I had a chill this morning, too tired to shake
 I got a good poker hand, too tired to win
 I can hear my baby knocking, too tired to let her in

[C]
 I'm tired, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm tired
 Too tired, too tired for anything

[V2]
 I'm too tired to walk, too tired to run
 I can hear my baby calling, too tired, too tired

;SOLO

[V3]
 I'm tired of prosperity, I'm tired of luck
 I'm sitting on a pin, too tired to get up

;SOLO</lyrics>

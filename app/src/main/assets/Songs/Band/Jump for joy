[V1]
I say come on everybody, let's have a ball
It makes no difference if your big or small
Put off your shoes and leave em at the door
If you ain't too drunk you can get a drink or four

[C]
Come on y'all gonna jump for joy tonight
We're gonna take up the ribbons and put out all the lights

[V2]
You know bare foot Sally told mocking Joe
I would sock it to you but it's time to go
One drink of liquer and a good shot of wine
A whole lotta loving feel real fine

[V3]
We're gonna boogie in the kitchen and boogie down the hall
Boogie in the closet and up beside the wall
Ain't gonna stop till the clock strikes four
We'll be doin the rubby dubby, crying for more

;BREAK
;SOLO

;REPEAT VERSE 3

We're gonna jump....
Come on baby....</lyrics>

 Friday night and the lights are low

 Looking out for the place to go
.   E                         A/E   E              A/E				
 Oh, where they play the right music getting in the swing
.E                   F#m      E   F#m
 You come in to look for a king
.A                     D/A
 Anybody could be that guy
.A                              F#m
 Night is young and the music's high
.E                  A/E   E             A/E
 With a bit of rock music everything is fine
.E                  F#m       E   F#m      
 You're in the mood for a dance

 And when you get the chance

.A             D/A                    A         E/G#   D/F#m   A/E
 Dancing queen feel the beat from the tambourine oh yeah
.E             C#7          F#m                     B7/D#
 You can dance you can jive having the time of your life
.D             Bm7              E7/B       A              D/A  A  D/A  A  D/A  A  D/A  
 See that girl watch that scene dig in the dancing queen

[V2]
You're a teaser you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[C]
 You are the dancing queen young and sweet only seventeen
 Dancing queen feel the beat from the tambourine oh yeah
 You can dance you can jive having the time of your life
 See that girl watch that scene dig in the dancing queen 
 Dig in the dancing queen.......</lyrics>

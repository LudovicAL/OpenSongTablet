  <lyrics>[V1]
.       Em                D
 When I passed you in the doorway
.    C              G       
 You took me with a glance
.Em                  D
 I shoulda took that last bus home, 
.      C               G
 But I asked you for a dance
 
[V2]
 Now we go steady to the pictures,
 I always get chocolate stains on my pants
 My father he's going crazy
 Says I'm living in a trance

[C]
.                       Em
 But I'm dancin' in the moonlight
.C                     G                       D/F#
 It's caught me in its spotlight, its alright, alright
.               Em
 Dancin' in the moonlight
.C                 G
 In this long, hot summer night

[V3]
 It's three o'clock in the morning
 And I'm on the streets again
 I disobeyed another warning
 I should have been in by ten
 
[V4]
 Now I won't get out until Sunday
 I'll have to say I stayed with friends
 But it's a habit worth forming
 If it means to justify the end</lyrics>

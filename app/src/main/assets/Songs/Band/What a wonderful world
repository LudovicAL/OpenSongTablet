  <lyrics>[INTRO]
.F   Gm   Am   Gm

[V1
.      F        Am     Bb        Am
 I see trees of green, red roses too
.Gm         F      A          Dm
 I see them bloom, for me and you
.      Db               Gm/C   C         F   Gm   Am   Gm
 And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

[V2]
.      F        Am    Bb            Am
 I see skies of blue, and clouds of white
.Gm                 F    A               Dm
 The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
.      Db               Gm/C   C         F   Gm   Bb   F
 And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

[C]
.    C                          F
 The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
.    C                    F
 Are also on the faces of people going by
.      Dm              Am           Dm         Am
 I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
.Dm             Ebo7    Gm     C
 They’re really saying ‘I love you’

[V3]
.       F      Am   Bb           Am
 I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
.Gm                 F    A              Dm
 They’ll learn much more and I’ll never know
.      Db               Gm/C   C         F   Eb   D   D
 And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
.       Gm               Gm     C         F  
 Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world</lyrics></song>

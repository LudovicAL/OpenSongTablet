  <lyrics>[Intro]
.E    D     G    A   B
 
[V1]
.       E
 Coming to you on a dusty road, Good loving, I've got a truck load
.
 And when you get it, you've got some, So don't worry, cause I'm coming
 
[C]
.      E       D       E
 I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man
.       E       D       E         A  B
 I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man
 
[V2]
 Got what I got, the hard way, And I'll make it better each and every day
 So honey, don't you fret, Cause you ain't seen nothing yet
 
;Chorus
 
[V3]
 I was brought up on a side street, Learned to love before I could eat
 I was educated from good stock, But I've got loving and I just can't stop

 Give you hope and be your only boyfriend yeah

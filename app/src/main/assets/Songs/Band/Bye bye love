.D       A     D       A
 Bye bye love, bye bye happiness 
.D     A             A         E     A
 Hello loneliness, I think I'm gonna cry 
.D       A     D       A
 Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress 
.D     A            A         E       A
 Hello emptiness, I feel like I could die 
.    A      E         A
 Bye bye my love, goodbye 

[V1]
.              E                 A 
 There goes my baby with someone new 
.               E               A
 She sure looks happy I sure am blue 
.           D                    E
 She was my baby Till he stepped in 
.           E                        A 
 Goodbye to romance, that might have been 

;CHORUS 

[V2]
 I'm through with romance, I'm through with love 
 I'm through with counting, The stars above 
 And hereâ€™s the reason that I'm so free 
 My loving baby is through with me

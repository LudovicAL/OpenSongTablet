[V1]
.       D        F#m           G        A
 Have I told you lately that I love you?
.       D        F#m             G        A
 Have I told you there's no one above you?

 Fill my heart with gladness, dance away my sadness
.Em7     A                         D      Em7   A
 Ease my troubles, that's what you do

[V2]
.       D       F#m            G     A
 Oh the morning sun in all its glory
.           D        F#m              G   A
 Greets the day with hope and comfort too
.        G                           F#m
 And you fill my life with laughter, you can make it better
.Em7     A                        D    D7
 Ease my troubles that's what you do

[C]

 There's a love divine, and it's yours and it's mine
.         F#m
 Like the sun
.G
 At the end of the day, 
.                                      F#m Em7  A
 We should give thanks and pray to the One

[Outro]

 Ease my troubles that's what you do
.Em7     A                        D
 Ease my troubles that's what you do</lyrics>

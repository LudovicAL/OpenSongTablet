  <lyrics>[INTRO.(Guitar riff)]
.E

[V1]
.       A              F#m
 Pretty woman, walking down the street
.       A                 F#m
 Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet
.       D                E7
 Pretty woman, I don't believe you, you're not the truth
.             E7              E (guitar riff)
 No one could look as good as you, mercy

[V2]
 Pretty woman, won't you pardon me
 Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
 Pretty woman, you look as lovely as can be
 But are you lonesome just like me? (rhooaaaw!)
 
[B]
.Dm7          G             C            Am
 Pretty woman stop a while, pretty woman talk a while
.Dm7          G                    C  C7
 Pretty woman say you'll smile for me
.Dm7           G               C            Am
 Pretty woman, yeah yeah yeah, pretty woman walk my way
.Dm7          G                    C  A7
 Pretty woman say you'll stay with me
.      F#m       Dm             E
 For I need you, I'll treat you right
.A    E/G#   F#m      Dm        E (guitar riff)
 Come to  me darling, be mine tonight

[V3]
 Pretty woman, don't you walk on by
 Pretty woman, don't you make me cry
 Pretty woman, don't walk away, hey, okay
 I guess you’re going home, it’s late
 Maybe tomorrow night, but wait, what do I see
 
[GUITAR TO END]
 Yeah, she's walking back to me, yeah, she's walking back to me
 Oh, oh, Pretty woman</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.             C                   F
 Well she was just seventeen, you know what I mean
.                                         G7
 And the way she looked was way beyond compare
.   C           C/E         F       Fm/Ab
 So how could I dance with another, Oh,
.       C       G7       C
 When I saw her standing there

[V2]
 Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
 That before too long I'd fall in love with her
 She wouldn't dance with another, Oh,
 When I saw her standing there
 
[B]
.        F
 Well my heart went boom when I crossed that room
.                       G7  F
 And I held her hand in mine

[V3]
 Oh we danced through the night,
 And we held each other tight
 And before too long I fell in love with her
 No I'll never dance with another, Oh,
 When I saw her standing there
 
[B]

[V4]
 Oh we danced through the night,
 And we held each other tight
 And before too long I fell in love with her
 No I'll never dance with another, Oh,
 When I saw her standing there ...</lyrics></song>

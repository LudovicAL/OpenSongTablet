.Am Bm7  Cmaj7   Bm7

[V1]
.      Am Bm7  Cmaj7
 Summertime,         
.        Bm7       Am Bm7  Cmaj7   Bm7
 And the livin' is easy,
.         Dm  Dmmaj7  Dm7
 Fish are jumpin',        
.        Dm6       E  F  E   Ealt
 And the cotton is high
.             Am Bm7 Cmaj7
 Your daddy's rich,        
.         Bm7          Am Bm7 Cmaj7 Bm7
 And your mamma's good lookin', 
.   Cmaj7       Am7   Ealt      Am Bm7 Cmaj7  Bm7 ....
 So hush little baby, don't you cry

[V2]
 One of these mornings, 
 You're going to rise up singing
 Then you'll spread your wings, 
 And you'll take to the sky
 But till that morning, 
 There's a'nothing can harm you
 With daddy and mamma standing by</lyrics></song>

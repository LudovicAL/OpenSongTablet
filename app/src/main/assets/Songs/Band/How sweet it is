.D            E                 A
 How sweet it is to be loved by you, oh yes it is now baby
.D            E                 A
 How sweet is is to be loved by you, ooh baby

.  A                  F#m               E             D
 I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
.  A                      F#m                    E             D
 I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and there you were
.A                     D       A              D
 With sweet love and devotion, deeply touches my emotion
.        A                  D             A                  D
 I wanna stop and thank you baby, I wanna stop and thank you baby

 Close my eyes at night and wonder what I would be without you in my life
 Everything was just a bore, all the things I did, seems I've done em before
 But to brighten up all my days, with a love so sweet in so many ways
 I wanna stop and thank you baby, I wanna stop and thank you baby

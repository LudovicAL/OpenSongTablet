  <lyrics>[INTRO TRUMPETS]
.E    B7   E    B7   E    B7   E    B7

[V1]
.E             B7         E   B7
 Here comes my happiness again,
.E             B7                   E   B7 
 Right back to where it should have been
.E                B7            E   B7 
 'Cause now she's gone and I am free
.E             B7            E  B7 
 And she can't do a thing to me
 
[C]    
 I just want to dance the night away
 With se√±oritas who can sway
 Right now tomorrow's looking bright
 Just like the sunny morning light

[B]
 And if you should see her, please let her know 
 That I'm well as you can tell
 And if she should tell you, she wants me back, 
 Tell her no, I've gotta go

[C]

[TRUMPET SOLO]

[GUITAR SOLO]

  <lyrics>[V1]
 Have you ever loved a woman,
 So much you tremble in pain?
 Yes, have you ever loved a woman,
 So much you tremble in pain?
 Yes, all the time you know,
 She bears another man's name

[V2]
 You just love that woman,
 So much it's a shame an' a sin
 Yes, you just love that woman,
 So much it's a shame an' a sin
 Yes, you know, yes you know,
 She's in love to your very best friend

[V3]
 Yes, have you ever loved a woman,
 One that you know you can't leave her alone?
 Yes, have you ever loved a woman,
 One you know you can't leave her alone?
 Yes, 'cause there's somethin' deep inside a you,
 Won't let you wreck your best friend's home
 Hey, hey, hey</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[Intro]
.G   D/F#   Am    C   x4

[V1]
.G                     Am           C               G
 From a phone booth in Vegas Jessie calls at five a.m.
.                      Am    C           G
 To tell me how she's tired   of all of them
.                         Am               C              G
 She says 'Baby I've been thinking about a trailer by the sea
.             Am      C                 D
 We can go to Mexico: you, the cat, and me
.           Em    D              C
 We drink tequila   and look for sea-shells
.    Em      D          C
 Now doesn't that sound sweet
.Em          D      C
 Jessie, you always do this
.                           D     C    D   C   D
 Everytime I get back on my feet       

[Chorus]
.G                  C               G              C
 Jessie, paint your pictures, about how it's gonna be
.   G                 C
 By now I should know better
.     D                Em7   D/F#
 Your dreams are never free
.    G            C               G              C
 But tell me all about our little trailer by the sea
.G              C           D            Em7   D/F#
 Jessie you can always sell any dream to me  
.G              C           D            G (as intro x2)
 Jessie you can always sell any dream to me

[V2]
 She asks me how the cat's been, I say Moses, he's just fine
 He used to think about you all the time
 We finally took your pictures down from the wall
 Jessie how do you always seem to know just when to call?
 She says get your stuff together
 Bring Mose' and drive real fast
 And listening to her promise
 I swear to God this time it's gonna last

;Chorus
;Solo as first half of chorus, then song 2nd half

[Mid8]
.  Em       D      C
 I love you in the sunshine
.        Em          D          C
 Lay you down in the warm white sand
.    Em        D     C
 And who knows maybe this time
.                                     D       C    D     C     D
 Things may turn out just the way you planned      

;Chorus

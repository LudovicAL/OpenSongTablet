  <lyrics>[V1]
.Am        E                   Am
 Father in heaven our voices we raise 
.              E                       Am
 Receive our devotion, receive now our praise 
.                  F                        C
 As we sing of the glory of all that You've done 
.                  G                      E
 The greatest love story that's ever been sung
 
[C]
.            Am        G       Am 
 And we will crown You Lord of all 
.             Am        G       Am 
 Yes, we will crown You Lord of all 
.    F        G       E    Am 
 For You have won the victory 
.             Am        G       Am 
 Yes, we will crown You Lord of all 
 
[V2] 
Father in heaven our lives are Your own 
We've been caught by a vision of Jesus alone 
Who came as a servant to free us from sin 
Father in heaven our worship we bring
 
[V3] 
We will sing 'Hallelujah', we will sing to the King 
To our Mighty Deliverer our hallelujahs will ring 
Yes, our praise is resounding to the Lamb on the throne 
He alone is exalted through the love He has shown</lyrics>

.F2 Gm7 Bb C7sus4

[V1]
.F2           Bb
 Who is there like You
.F2                 Bb                  Dm7
 And who else would give their life for me,
.     Gm7             C7sus4
 Even suffering in my place?||
.F2            Bb
 And who could repay You?
.Dm7       Bb             Dm7
 All of creation looks to You,
.           Gm7                   C7sus4
 And You provide for all You have made

[C]
.                     F                    Gm7
 So I'm lifting up my hands, lifting up my voice
.                F/A                       Bb
 Lifting up Your name, and in Your grace I rest
.         Gm7              C7sus4        F2     C7sus4
 For Your love has come to me and set me free.||
.                         F                      Gm7
 And I'm trusting in Your word, trusting in Your cross
.                 F/A                        Bb
 Trusting in Your blood and all Your faithfulness,
.         Gm7              C7sus4         F2 Gm7 Bb C7sus4 (F2)
 For Your power at work in me in changing me.</lyrics>

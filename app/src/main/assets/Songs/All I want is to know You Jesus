.C2               D2
 All I want is to know You, Jesus,
.C2               D2               C2
 All I want is to know I belong to You.
.C2                 D2        
 Show me all of the things that are worthless,
.C2                                 D2
 That I thought were so valuable to You

[C]
.G                     D/F#
 Nothing is as lovely, nothing is as worthy,
.Em7                        D2
 Nothing is as wonderful as knowing You.
.G                     D/F#
 Nothing is as lovely, nothing is as worthy,
.Em7                        D2           C2   D2 ..... etc.
 Nothing is as wonderful as knowing You.

[V2]
.C2               D2
 All I want is to know You, Jesus,
.C2                 D2                  C2
 And the power that raised You from the dead.
.                       D2
 Help me forget all the things that I've done,
.C2                       D2
 And set my heart on what lies ahead.</lyrics>

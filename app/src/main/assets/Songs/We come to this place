 We come to this place in the name of the Lord
.G                           C
 To bow down and worship the King
.        C
 We will lift up our hands in surrender to You
.    G                        C
 The song on our hearts glady bring
.         F                        C/E
 With our offering of praise, Lord we cry out to You
.     G/D                   C
 Your glory to fall in this place
.        F                           Am
 In Your presence we stand, with the angels on high
.        G                      G/B             C
 Raise a shout of joy!  Raise a shout of joy to You

[V2]
 As a gathering we come, joined in brotherly love
 Our lives in surrender we bring
 With Your word on out hearts, to be shared in this place
 Our song and our prayers are for You
 Lord, You've called us to come and to share in Your love
 To build up this people today
 Lord my offering to You is my all from this day
 Let my life speak of You!  Let my life speak of You, Lord I pray!</lyrics>

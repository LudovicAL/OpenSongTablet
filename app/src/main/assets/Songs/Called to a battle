.F#m     D  E      F#m    D  E

[V1]
.F#m                D E  F#m         D E
 Called to a battle,     heavenly war
.F#m                     D E F#m  D     E
 Though we may struggle,     victory is sure
.F#m                     D E F#m               D E
 Death will not triumph,     though we may die
.F#m                D E F#m  D      E
 Jesus has promised,    our eternal life

[C]
.       A                          E   F#m
 By the blood of the Lamb we shall overcome
.F#m             E       A
 See the accuser, thrown down
.       A                         E   F#m
 By the word of the Lord we shall overcome
.        D       E
 Raise a victory cry
.     F#m                 D E
 Like thunder in the skies
.F#m                 D E
 Thunder in the skies

[V2]
 Standing together, moving as one
 We are God's army, called to overcome
 We are commissioned, Jesus says go
 In every nation, let His love be known</lyrics>

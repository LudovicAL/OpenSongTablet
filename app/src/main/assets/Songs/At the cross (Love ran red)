.Bb2   Dm   C/E   F   F/A   Bb2

[V1]
.Bb2        Dm         C/E   F          F/A   Bb2
 There's a place where mercy reigns and never dies
.Bb2       Dm          C/E        F          F/A      Bb2
 There's a place where streams of grace flow deep and wide
.              Cadd4     F/A  Bb2
 Where all the love I've ever found
.             Cadd4        F/A     Bb2
 Comes like a flood, comes flowing down

[C]
.       Bb2                       F
 At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life
.       C                  Gm7
 I'm in awe of You, I'm in awe of You
.           Bb2                 F
 Where Your love ran red and my sin washed white
.      C             Gm7              Bb2   F   Bb2/F
 I owe all to You, I owe all to You, Jesus

[V2]
.Bb2       Dm          C/E     F         F/A  Bb2
 There's a place where sin and shame are powerless
.Bb2          Dm        C/E        F          F/A Bb2
 And there my heart has peace with God and forgiveness
.              Cadd4     F/A  Bb2
 Where all the love I've ever found
.             Cadd4        F/A     Bb2
 Comes like a flood, comes flowing down

[B]
.Bb2                   Dm
 Here my hope is found here on holy ground
.F                C/E
 Here I bow down, here I bow down
.Bb2                  Dm
 Here arms open wide, here You save my life
.F                C/E
 Here I bow down, here I bow down

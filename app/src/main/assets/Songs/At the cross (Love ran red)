.G - Em - D/F# - G - G/B - C2

[V1]
.C           Em            D/F#  G        G/B   C2
 There's a  place where mercy  reigns and never dies
.          Em          D/F#       G          G/B      C2
 There's a place where streams of grace flow deep and wide
.              Dadd4          C2
 Where all the love I've ever found
.             Dadd4               C2
 Comes like a flood, comes flowing down

[C]
.       C2                        G
 At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life
.       D                  Am7
 I'm in awe of You, I'm in awe of You
.           C2                  G
 Where Your love ran red and my sin washed white
.      D             Am7        C2   G   C2/G
 I owe all to You, I owe all to You, Jesus

[V2]
.C         Em          D/F#    G         G/B  C2
 There's a place where sin and shame are powerless
.            Em         D/F#      G           G/B  C2
 And there my heart has peace with God and forgiveness
.         Dadd4          G/B  C2
 Where all the love I've ever found
.            Dadd4         G/B  C2
 Comes like a flood, comes flowing down

[B]
.C2                      Em
 Here my hope is found here on holy ground
.G                D/F#
 Here I bow down, here I bow down
 C2                   Em
 Here arms open wide, here You save my life
 G/D              D
 Here I bow down, here I bow down</lyrics>

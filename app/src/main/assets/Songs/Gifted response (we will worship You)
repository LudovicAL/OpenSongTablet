 This is a gifted response
.                 D2                     D2aug
 Father we cannot come to You by our own merit
.        D2                       D2aug
 We will come in the name of Your son
.                D2                           D2aug
 As He glorifies You and in the power of Your Spirit

 We have come to something so mysterious
.    G2                Asus
 Too deep for minds to comprehend
.            Em7                 D/F#
 Through the open door where the angels sing
.        G2                 Asus
 And the host of heaven are antheming...

[C]
.          D
 And we'll sing the glory of Your name
.    Em7
 Celebrate the glories of Your fame
.        G2                   Gm6
 We will worship You, We will worship You||
.          D
 And we'll make Your praise so glorious
.        Em7
 Singing songs of everlasting praise
.        G2                   Gm6        (D2 As intro)
 We will worship You, We will worship You</lyrics></song>

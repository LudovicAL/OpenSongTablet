.D              Dsus   D          Bm   
1These were the words, God to     Adam:
2These were the words, God to     Abraham:
3These were the words, God to the prophet:
4These were the words, God to the shepherds
.D            D7         G
1You are a    rebel,   banished from light
2Look to the  heavens, number the stars
3Wait for the baby,    look for my Son
4Go the the   village, look for the child
.Em        A7         D           Bm
1From the  serpent    and his     evil
2Your des__cendants   shall be as many but
3Wonderful counselor, God so      mighty
4He is the Saviour    born       among you
.E             E7          A             A7
1You will find death and   sorrow and    night
2One shall     shine much  brighter than all
3Eternal       Father, yet Prince of     peace
4 God in a     stable,     far from the  light
.D            Dsus    D       Bm
1This was the promise to  all people
2This is the  promise for all people
3This is the  promise for all people
4This is the  promise for all people
.A/C#        B7/D#        Em
1From the    woman a      Saviour will come;
2He will be  born of      Abraham's line,
3He will be  ruler of     heaven and earth;
4Those who receive Him as Jesus the Lord,
.Em7           A7       D           Bm
1By his        living   and his     dying
2He will bring back the blessing of heaven to
3His great     kingdom  and his     power shall
4He gives      mercy,   life and    power to
.Em            A7        D
1He will bring life     again
2Every         family on earth
3Never be      taken    away
4Be a          child of  God

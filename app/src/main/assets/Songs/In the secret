  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                           C
 In the secret, in the quiet place,
.Em               D       C
 In the stillness You are there;
.G                           C
 In the secret, in the quiet hour I wait, only for You,
.Em               D        C
 'Cause I want to know You more...

[C]
.G         D
 I want to know You,
.Em        C
 I want to hear Your voice,
.G         D        C
 I want to know You more;
.G         D
 I want to touch You,
.Em        C
 I want to see Your face,
.G         D        C
 I want to know You more.

[V2]
.G                             C
 I am reaching for the highest goal,
.Em             D         C
 That I might receive the prize;
.G                              C
 Pressing onward, pushing every hindrance aside,|out of my way,
.Em               D        C
 'Cause I want to know You more...</lyrics>

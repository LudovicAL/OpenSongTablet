  <lyrics>[V]
.F#m/B   E      E/G#       A                  A/B
 My    Redeemer lives, and I will see His glory,
.F#m/B E         C#m7     F#m7          A/B
 As He works all things together for my good
.F#m/B    C#m    E/B       A      E/G#   F#m7
 Whatever things occur, of this I can be sure:
.       A/B  F#m/B  E
 I know my Redeemer lives

[C]
.G#m7            C#m7             F#m7
 Even though I walk through the valley,
.A/B            B7          E
 I will fear no evil, He is with me;
.    A                B/A     G#m7               C#m7
 And on the battlefield, although the pain is real,
.   F#m7                A/E         Dmaj7      A/B
 My struggles soon will fade as His glory is revealed</lyrics>

 You've put a new song in my mouth,
.                            Asus4
 You've put a new song in my heart.  x2

[C1]
.              G                           D
 And I'm gonna worship You, yes, I'm gonna worship You
.    Em           D/F#                 G               Asus4  A
 All creation bow before You, give the honour due Your Name
.                  G                              D
 And I'm called to worship You, yes I'm called to worship You
.       Em                D/F#          G             Asus4 A
 In the splendour of Your Holiness with trembling and fear
.          D
 I'm gonna worship You.

[V2]
 You've set a fire in my soul,
 You've set a fire in my heart.  x2

[C2]
 And I wanna praise Your Name,|Yes I wanna praise Your Name,
 Let Your burning fire consume my heart|And cleanse me from within,
 And I'm called to praise Your Name,|Yes I'm called to praise Your Name,
 Let the love of Christ burn in my heart|And shine for all to see
 I'm gonna praise Your Name.

[V3]
 You've placed a power in my life,
 You've placed a power in my heart.  x2

[C3]
 And I wanna lift You up,|Yes I wanna lift You up,
 By the power of Your Spirit,|I will stand before all men,
 And I'm called to lift You up,|Yes I'm called to lift You up,
 Lift You up for all the world to see,|I am Yours and You're my Lord
 I'm gonna lift You up.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.C                 B7 C
 Beneath the cross of Jesus
.  G7                 C
 I fain would take my stand,
.    Am              A7 Dm
 The shadow of a mighty rock
.    F    B7    E
 Within a weary land;
.C                       C7
 A home within the wilderness,
.  F      A7     Dm
 A rest upon the way,
.         G7             C        C7
 From the burning of the noontide heat,
.F       C      G7     C
 And the burden of the day.

[V2]
 O safe and happy shelter!
 O refuge tried and sweet!
 O trysting place where heaven's love
 And heaven's justice meet!
 As to the holy patriarch
 That wondrous dream was given,
 So seems my Saviour's cross to me
 A ladder up to heaven.

[V3]
 There lies, beneath its shadow,
 But on the farther side,
 The darkness of an awful grave
 That gapes both deep and wide;
 And there between us stands the cross,
 Two arms outstretched to save;
 Like a watchman set to guard the way
 From that eternal grave.

[V4]
 Upon that cross of Jesus
 Mine eye at times can see
 The very dying form of One
 Who suffered there for me;
 And from my smitten heart, with tears,
 Two wonders I confess -
 The wonders of His glorious love,
 And my own worthlessness.

[V5]
 I take, O cross, thy shadow,
 For my abiding place;
 I ask no other sunshine than
 The sunshine of His face;
 Content to let the world go by,
 To know no gain nor loss -
 My sinful self my only shame,
 My glory all the cross.</lyrics>

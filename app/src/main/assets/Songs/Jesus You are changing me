.F      C       F
 Jesus, You are changing me,
.   C7/G Bb/F F     Bb/D   F       G7  C7   
 By Your Spirit You're making me like You.

 Jesus, You're transforming me,
.A7        Dm                G             C7
 That Your loveliness may be seen in all I do.

[C]
.Am          Dm         Gm       C
 You are the potter and I am the clay,
.A7            Dm         Bb      Gm7       C7
 Help me to be willing to let You have Your way.

 As   I   let You reign supreme within my heart.

[C]
.E                    Emaj7/D#
 Let everything that, everything that,
.C#m7            A          A/B        E
 Everything that has breath praise the Lord.
.E                    Emaj7/D#
 Let everything that, everything that,
.C#m7            A          A/B        F#m7
 Everything that has breath praise the Lord.

[V1]
.E                          E/D#
 Praise You in the morning, praise You in the evening,
.C#m7                                   A
 Praise You when I'm young and when I'm old.
.E                             E/D#
 Praise You when I'm laughing, praise You when I'm grieving,
.C#m7                           A
 Praise You every season of the soul.||
.   F#m7             E/G#      
 If we could see how much You're worth,
.     F#m7                    E/G#
 Your power, Your might, Your endless love
.     F#m7            E/G#           A
 Then surely we would never cease to praise.

[V2]
 Praise You in the heavens, joining with the angels,
 Praising You forever and a day.
 Praise You on the earth now, joining with creation,
 Calling all the nations to Your praise.||
 If they could see how much You're worth,
 Your power, your might, Your endless love,
 Then surely they would never cease to praise.

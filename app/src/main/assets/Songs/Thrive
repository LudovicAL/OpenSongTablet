  <lyrics>[Intro]
.(E)  A   E A   E A   E   B

[V1]
.A                                                       E
 Here in this worn and weary land where many a dream has died
.A                                                  E
 Like a tree planted by the water we never will run dry 

[P]
.          A             E               A                  E
 So living water flowing through, God we thirst for more of You 
.         A                    E                B
 Fill our hearts and flood our souls with one desire 

[C]
.        A               E                  A                 E
 Just to know You and to make You known, we lift Your name on high
.      A                 E                B
 Shine like the sun made darkness run and hide 
.        A                E                 C#m      B
 We know we were made for so much more than ordinary lives 
.     A              E                 B      A       B       E
 It's time for us to more than just survive - we were made to thrive 

[Interlude as verse]
.A   E A   E A   E   B

[V2]
 Into Your word we're digging deep to know our Father's heart
 Into the world we're reaching out to show them who You are 

;Prechorus then Chorus

  <lyrics>[V1]
 O perfect love, o perfect sacrifice,
 Fountain of life poured out for me,
 What heights and depths of heavens mercy
 The faithfulness that I believe
 And to whom shall I run, and in whom shall I hide
 Only You hold the truth I desire
 O perfect love, my prayer shall ever be
 To be found in Jesus
 
[V2]
 O perfect love, O perfect mystery,
 You were condemned, but I go free,
 What truth to know, that I can rest upon,
 Your perfect love has covered me.
 And what can this heart know, and what can this heart tell
 But of grace that has rescued me,
 O perfect love, my prayer shall ever be,
 To be found in Jesus.
 
[V3]
 O perfect love, forever I shall sing
 Of heavens gates flung wide for me
 Where fear of death and tears of hopelessness
 Are swallowed up in victory;
 And what praise shall be sung still to the Holy One
 To the Saviour, Redeemer and King,
 O perfect love, my song shall ever be
 I am found in Jesus</lyrics></song>

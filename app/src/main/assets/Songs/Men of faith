  <lyrics>[V1]
.       E          B      A
 Men of faith rise up and sing
.       E         B        A
 Of the great and glorious King
.        E           B        A
 You are strong when you feel weak
.        E     B       A    A
 In your brokenness complete
 
[C]
.E            A             B
 Shout to the north and the south
.E           A            B
 Sing to the east and the west
.C#m7     A          B
 Jesus is Saviour to all
.A       B          E
 Lord of heaven and earth
 
[V2]
 Rise up women of the truth
 Stand and sing to broken hearts
 Who can know the healing power
 Of our glorious King of love
 
[V3]
 Rise up church with broken wings
 Fill this place with songs again
 Of our God who reigns on high
 By His grace again we'll fly
 
[B]
.C#m                      A
 We've been through fire, we've been through rain
.C#m                       A
 We've been refined by the power of His name
.C#m                 A
 We've fallen deeper in love with You
.A                 E/G#         Bsus4 B/A B/G# B/F#
 You've burned the truth on our lips</lyrics>

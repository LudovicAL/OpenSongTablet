  <lyrics>[V1]
.F                     
 Father, I place into your hands
.    C
 The things I cannot do,
.     
 Father, I place into your hands
.    F
 The things that I've been through.
.                F7
 Father, I place into your hands
.    Bb                Bbm
 The way that I should go,
.      F      C                F
 For I know I always can trust you. 

[V2]
 Father, I place into your hands
 My friends and family.
 Father, I place into your hands
 The things that trouble me.
 Father, I place into your hands
 The person I would be,
 For I know I always can trust you. 

[V3]
 Father, we love to see your face,
 We love to hear your voice.
 Father, we love to sing your praise
 And in your name rejoice.
 Father, we love to walk with you
 And in your presence rest,
 For we know we always can trust you. 

[V4]
 Father, I want to be with you
 And do the things you do.
 Father, I want to speak the words
 That you are speaking too.
 Father, I want to love the ones
 That you will draw to you,
 For I know that I am one with you.</lyrics>

 God You're good to me
 You gave me life and set me free
 God You're good to me
 Opened my eyes and let me see
 I could search but I won't find anyone like You

[V1]
 I know I don't deserve this love You have for me
 You sent Your son to die upon a tree
 And sometimes when I'm feeling far from You
 I hear Your voice calling me and I begin to sing

[V2]
 I know You'll always be with me everyday
 Your Spirit inme showing me the way
 And I will try to be the best that I can be
 'Cause I know Your love for me is deeper than the sea </lyrics></song>

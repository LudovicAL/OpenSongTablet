.G               Am                G/B           C2
 Worthy, You are worthy, much more worthy than I know
.G         Am              G/B          C2
 I cannot imagine just how glorious You are||
.D            C                 G/B             C2
 And I cannot begin to tell how deep a love You bring
.D                   C
 O Lord my ears have heard of You,
.    G/B              C2
 But now my eyes have seen
 
[C]
.       G              Am             G/B   C2
 You're worthy, You're worthy, You're worthy
.       G            Am         G/B        C2
 You're worthy to be praised forever and a day
.       G              Am             G/B   C2
 You're worthy, You're worthy, You're worthy
.       G            Am         G/B        C2
 You're worthy to be praised forever and a day
 
[V2]
.G              Am           G/B              C2
 Glory, I give glory, to the One who saved my soul
.G                    Am                 G/B               C2
 You found me and You freed me, from the shame that was my own||
.D            C                 G/B             C2
 And I cannot begin to tell how merciful You've been
.D                   C
 O Lord my ears have heard of You,
.    G/B              C2
 But now my eyes have seen
 
[B]
.G             Am            G/B     C2
 We'll sing an anthem of the highest praise
.G              Am             G/B      C2
 We'll sound an anthem of Your glorious Name</lyrics>

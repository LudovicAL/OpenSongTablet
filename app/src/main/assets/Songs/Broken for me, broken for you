[C]
.E          Amaj7 F#m        B
 Broken for me,   broken for you,
.E           Amaj7  F#m        B
 The body of Jesus, broken for you.
 
[V1]
.E              Amaj7 F#m               Bsus4 B
 He offered His body, He poured out His soul;
.E         Amaj7   F#m              Bsus4  B
 Jesus was broken, that we might be whole:

[V2]
 Come to My table and with Me dine;
 Eat of My bread and drink of My wine.

[V3]
 This is My body given for you;
 Eat it remembering I died for you.

[V4]
 This is My blood I shed for you;
 For your forgiveness, making you new.

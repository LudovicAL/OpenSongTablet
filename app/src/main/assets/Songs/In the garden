  <lyrics>[V1]
.  G                                   C                   G
 I come to the garden alone, While the dew is still on the roses;
.        D                    G              A7            D
 And the voice I hear falling on my ear, The Son of God discloses.

[C]
.       G                     D
 And He walks with me, and He talks with me,
.       C        D7       G
 And He tells me I am His own;
.        G      B7          Em    C
 And the joy we share as we tarry there,
.     G         D7   G
 None other has ever known.

[V2]
.   G                                        C                          G
 He speaks, and the sound of His voice Is so sweet the birds hush their singing;
.        D              G               A7             D
 And the melody that He gave to me, Within my heart is ringing.

[V3]
.    G                                       C                  G
 I'd stay in the garden with Him, Though the night around me be falling;
.       D                    G                 A7             D
 But He bids me go; thru the voice of woe, His voice to me is calling.</lyrics>

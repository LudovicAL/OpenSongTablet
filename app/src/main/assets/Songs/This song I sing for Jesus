.     A      E/G#     D/F# E     A    E/G#   D/F# E
 This song I sing for Jesus,|The Holy Son of God;
.    A     E/G#    D/F#     E       D               E
 The day I came to know Him|And the day he welcomed me.

[C]
.     A      A/C#     D   E      A        A/C#     D  E
 This song I sing for Jesus,|And all He's done for me;
.    F#m    E      D        E         Bm7               E
 The wonder of the cross of love,|The blood He shed for me.

[V2]
 To gaze upon those scars Lord,|Those nail marks meant for me;
 Such wondrous love I'll never know,|Through all eternity.

[V3]
 In that quiet place Lord,|Is where I'll meet with You;
 To hear the words upon Your lips,|Your beauty to behold.

[V4]
 A closer walk with You Lord,|Is all my heart desires;
 To know the fulness of Your grace,|To know You as my Friend.

 That blood was shed for me,|That blood was shed for me,
.     D         E        A
 That blood was shed for me.

.G           D/F# Em          Bm/D
 One thing I ask, one thing I seek
.C           G             C        D    C/D  D
 That I may dwell in your house, O Lord
.G         D/F#  Em        Bm/D
 All of my days, all of my life
.C          Dsus D    G
 That I may see you, Lord.
 
[C]
.     Em     C
 One thing I ask
.     Em      C
 One thing I desire
.       G       C/G
 Is to see you,
.       G       C/G
 Is to see you,
.       G
 Is to see you.
 
[V2]
.G          D/F#  Em             Bm/D
 Hear me, O Lord, hear me when I cry
.C             G         C        D  C/D  D
 Lord, do not hide your face from me
.G                D/F#  Em                Bm/D
 You have been my help, you have been my shield
.C            Dsus D  G
 And you will lift me up.</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bm                    Asus/C#                  D   D2
 From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
.Em              Em7/D            C
 Creation's revealing Your majesty
.Bm                  Asus/C#           D      D2
 From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
.Em                           Em7/D           C
 Every creature unique in the song that it sings
.G2
 All exclaiming
 
[C]
.D                    Asus
 Indescribable, uncontainable,
.G2                                              Bm
 You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
.                   G2
 You are amazing God
.D  D2           Asus
 All powerful, untameable,
.G2                                             Bm
 Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
.                 G2
 You are amazing God
 
[V2]
 Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
 Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
 Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
 Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
 None can fathom
 
[C2]
.D                    Asus
 Incomparable, unchangeable
.G2                                                  Bm
 You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
.                  G2                 G2
 You are amazing God,|You are amazing God</lyrics>

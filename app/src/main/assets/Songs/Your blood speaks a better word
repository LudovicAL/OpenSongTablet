.Bb2                        Bb2/G
 Your blood speaks a better word
.                   Bb2
 Than all the empty claims
.                     Gm
 I’ve heard upon this earth
.                         F
 Speaks righteousness for me
.                   Eb
 And stands in my defence
.                Bb2  Bb2/G Bb2/F
 Jesus it’s Your blood
 
[C]
.Bb                           Gm
 What can wash away our sins?|What can make us whole again?
.F                      Eb                       Bb F Eb
 Nothing but the blood,|Nothing but the blood of Jesus||
.Bb                             Gm
 What can wash us pure as snow?|Welcomed as the friends of God
.F                       Eb                          Bb F Eb
 Nothing but Your blood,|Nothing but Your blood King Jesus
 
[V2]
 Your cross testifies in grace
 Tells of the Father’s heart
 To make a way for us
 Now boldly we approach
 Not by earthly confidence
 It’s only Your blood</lyrics></song>

[V1]
.E             G#m                 C#m
 Your grace is enough, more than I need

 At Your word I will believe
.           G#m             C#m

 Let Your Spirit make me new
 
[C]
.       E/G#          A           F#m7         B/D#
 I will fall at Your feet, I will fall at Your feet

 And I will worship You here

 I am restored, I am redeemed
 By Your Spirit I am free 
 
[B]
.           E                                    B

 Lifted on high from death to life, forever our God is glorified

 Servant and King, rescued the world, this is our God

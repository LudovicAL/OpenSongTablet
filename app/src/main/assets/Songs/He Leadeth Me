.       D             D/F# G                   D                           A
1 He    leadeth me!   O    blessed thought! O  words with heavenly comfort fraught!
2 Lord, I would clasp Thy  hand in mine, Nor   ever murmur nor re__________pine,
3 And   when my task on    earth is done, When by Thy grace the victory's  won,

.      D                 D/F#  G                    D           Bm        D  A    D
1 What_e'er I do,        where'er I be, Still       'tis God's  hand that leadeth me.
2 Con__tent, what________ever  lot I see, Since     God through Jordan    leadeth me.
3 E'en death's cold wave I     will not flee, Since God through Jordan    leadeth me.

[C]
.   D       A      D   G   D              Bm      D       A
 He leadeth me, He leadeth me; By His own hand He leadeth me:
.    D        A        D G     D       Bm     D       A       D
 His faithful follower I would be, For by His hand He leadeth me.</lyrics>

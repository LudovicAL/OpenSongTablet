  <lyrics>[V1]
.     C       G       C         C      G7       C
 What kind of love is this that gave itself for me?
.F G      C  G/B Am       D7   G
 I am the guilty one, yet I go free.
.     C       G       C       C         G7    C
 What kind of love is this, a love I've never known;
.  F      G    Am       F           C       G       C   Csus4   C
 I didn't even know His name - What kind of love is this?

[V2]
.     C       G      C          C       G7 C
 What kind of man is this, that died in agony?
.F  G       C   G/B Am         D7            G
 He who had done no wrong, was crucified for me.
.     C       G      C         C     G7       C
 What kind of man is this, who laid aside His throne
.     F     G        Am      F          C       G      C   Csus4   C
 That I may know the love of God - What kind of man is this?

[V3]
.   C       G         C         C      G7      C
 By grace I have been saved; It is the gift of God.
.   F        G     C  G/B Am        D7     G
 He destined me to be His son, such is His love.
.   C       G    C        C       G7   C
 No eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard,
.    F       G        Am     F            C       G       C   Csus4   C
 Nor has the heart of man conceived, what kind of love is this.

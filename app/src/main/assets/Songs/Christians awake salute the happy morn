.C           G C                     F
 Christians, awake, salute the happy morn,
.C    F  G7  C          F  C/G  G   C
 Whereon the Saviour of mankind was born:
.         F        Dm   C  F  G
 Rise to adore the mystery of love,
.E              Am     F   Dm  Am/E E7 Am
 Which hosts of angels chanted from above;
.F    G        C      G C     G     D G
 With them the joyful tidings first begun
.C  F   G7 C          F   C/G  G   C
 Of God incarnate and the Virgin's Son.
 
[V2]
 Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,
 Who heard the angelic herald's voice: Behold,
 I bring good tidings of a Saviour's birth
 To you and all the nations upon earth:
 This day hath God fulfilled His promised word,
 This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord.
 
[V3]
 He spake; and straightway the celestial choir
 In hymns of joy, unknown before, conspire,
 The praises of redeeming love they sang,
 And heaven's whole orb with hallelujahs rang;
 God's highest glory was their anthem still,
 Peace upon earth, and unto men goodwill.
 
[V4]
 To Bethlehem straight the enlightened shepherds ran,
 To see the wonder God had wrought for man:
 Then to their flocks still praising God, return,
 And their glad hearts with holy rapture burn;
 Amazed the wondrous tidings they proclaim,
 The first apostles of His infant fame.
 
[V5]
 Oh may we keep and ponder in our mind
 God's wondrous love in saving lost mankind;
 Trace we the Babe, who hath retrieved our loss,
 From the poor manger to the bitter Cross;
 Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,
 Till man's first heavenly state again takes place.
 
[V6]
 Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among,
 To sing, redeemed, a glad triumphal song;
 He that was born upon this joyful day
 Around us all His glory shall display;
 Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing
 Eternal praise to heaven's almighty King.</lyrics>

[V1]
.C                    F/C   C    C                          Em
 Before the throne of God above, I have a strong, a perfect plea,
.  C/E         F     C/E   G        Am              F6        Dm7    F/G C
 A great High Priest whose name is "Love", who ever lives and pleads for me.

[C1]
.           F C/E  C      G      C          F  C/E  F  G   Am
 My name is graven on His hands, my name is written on His heart;
.  Am/G      F     C/E G         Am2
 I know that while in  heav'n He stands
.Am Am/G       F6     Dm7    F/G Am      Am/G       F6     Dm7    F/G  C
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.  No tongue can bid me thence depart.

[V2]
.C                    F/C   C         C                         Em
 When Satan tempts me to despair, and tells me of the guilt within,
.  C/E    F    C/E G       Am                 F6     Dm7 F/G C
 Upward I look and see Him there, who made an end to all my  sin.

[C2]
.            F  C/E  C       G        C      F    C/E F   G   Am
 Because the sinless Saviour died, my sinful soul is  counted free;
.    Am/G     F     C/E G    Am2
 For God, the Just, is  satisfied
.Am Am/G    F6      Dm7 F/G Am      Am/G    F6      Dm7 F/G C
 To look on him and pardon  me.  To look on him and pardon  me.

[V3]
.C                     F/C   C        C                          Em
 Behold him there! the risen Lamb, my perfect, spotless Righteousness,
.    C/E     F  C/E  G    Am      F6       Dm7  F/G    C
 The great unchangeable I AM, the King of glory and of grace!

[C3]
.            F   C/E C      G       C       F  C/E    F  G   Am
 One with Himself I  cannot die, my soul is purchased by His blood;
.   Am/G    F   C/E  G         Am2
 My life is hid with Christ on high,
.Am   Am/G       F6      Dm7 F/G Am         Am/G       F6      Dm7 F/G C
 With Christ, my Saviour and my  God.  With Christ, my Saviour and my  God.

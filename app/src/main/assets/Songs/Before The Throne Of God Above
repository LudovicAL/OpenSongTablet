[V1]
.D                    G/D   D    D                          F#m
 Before the throne of God above, I have a strong, a perfect plea,
.  D/F#         G     D/F#   A        Bm              G6        Em7    G/A D
 A great High Priest whose name is "Love", who ever lives and pleads for me.

[C1]
.           G D/F#  D      A      D          G  D/F#  G  A   Bm
 My name is graven on His hands, my name is written on His heart;
.  Bm/A      G     D/F# A         Bm2
 I know that while in  heav'n He stands
.Bm Bm/A       G6     Em7    G/A Bm      Bm/A       G6     Em7    G/A  D
 No tongue can bid me thence depart.  No tongue can bid me thence depart.

[V2]
.D                    G/D   D         D                         F#m
 When Satan tempts me to despair, and tells me of the guilt within,
.  D/F#    G    D/F# A       Bm                 G6     Em7 G/A D
 Upward I look and see Him there, who made an end to all my  sin.

[C2]
.            G  D/F#  D       A        D      G    D/F# G   A   Bm
 Because the sinless Saviour died, my sinful soul is  counted free;
.    Bm/A     G     D/F# A    Bm2
 For God, the Just, is  satisfied
.Bm Bm/A    G6      Em7 G/A Bm      Bm/A    G6      Em7 G/A D
 To look on him and pardon  me.  To look on him and pardon  me.

[V3]
.D                     G/D   D        D                          F#m
 Behold him there! the risen Lamb, my perfect, spotless Righteousness,
.    D/F#     G  D/F#  A    Bm      G6       Em7  G/A    D
 The great unchangeable I AM, the King of glory and of grace!

[C3]
.            G   D/F# D      A       D       G  D/F#  G    A   Bm
 One with Himself I  cannot die, my soul is purchased with His blood;
.   Bm/A    G   D/F#  A         Bm2
 My life is hid with Christ on high,
.Bm   Bm/A       G6      Em7 G/A Bm         Bm/A       G6      Em7 G/A D
 With Christ, my Saviour and my  God.  With Christ, my Saviour and my  God.

[V1]
.Eb                   Ab Eb                  Bb
 Break Thou the bread of life, dear Lord, to me,
.Eb                  Ab  Eb       Bb   F7  Bb
 As Thou didst break the bread, beside the sea;
.           Eb          Bb F7         Bb   Bb7
 Beyond the sacred page I  seek Thee, Lord;
.Eb        Ab                   Bbsus4 Bb7 Eb
 My spirit longs for Thee, Thou Living     Word.
 
[V2]
 Thou art the Bread of Life, O Lord, to me,
 Thy holy Word the truth that saveth me;
 Give me to eat and live with Thee above;
 Teach me to love Thy truth, for Thou art love.
 
[V3]
 O send Thy Spirit, Lord, now unto me,
 That He may touch my eyes and make me see;
 Show me the truth concealed within Thy Word,
 And in Thy Book revealed, I see Thee, Lord.

[V4]
 Bless Thou the Bread of Life to me, to me,
 As Thou didst bless the loaves by Galilee;
 Then shall all bondage cease, all fetters fall,
 And I shall find my peace, my all in all.

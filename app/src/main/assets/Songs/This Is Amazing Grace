  <lyrics>[V1]   
.G   
 Who breaks the power of sin and darkness   
.C   
 Whose love is mighty and so much stronger   
.Em                 D                  C   
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings   
.G   
 Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder   
.C   
 Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder   
.Em                 D                  C   
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings   
    
[C]   
.                G                        C
 This is amazing grace,|This is unfailing love   
.                       Em                            D
 That You would take my place,|That You would bear my cross||
.                         G                        C
 You would lay down Your life,|That I would be set free
.    Em                D....                    G
 Oh, Jesus, I sing for|All that You've done for me     
    
[V2]   
.G   
 Who brings our chaos back into order   
.C   
 Who makes the orphan a son and daughter   
.Em                 D               
 The King of Glory, the King of Glory   
.G   
 Who rules the nations with truth and justice   
.C   
 Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance   
.Em                 D                  C   
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings   

;Chorus x2

[B]   
.G                                 C
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, worthy is the King who conquered the grave
.G                                 C
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, worthy is the King who conquered the grave
.G                                 C
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, worthy is the King who conquered the grave
.G                                 C
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, worthy, worthy, worthy

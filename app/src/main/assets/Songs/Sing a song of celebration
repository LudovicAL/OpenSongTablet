.D
 Sing a song of celebration, lift up a shout of praise
.                        Gsus2              D
 For the bridegroom will come, the glorious One.
.    C G                     D           C G                 D 
 And oh, we will look on His face, we'll go to a much better place.||
.D    
 Dance with all your might, lift up your hands and clap for joy:
.                   Gsus2              D
 The time's drawing near when He will appear
.    C G                      D       C   G                  Asus4   A 
 And oh, we will stand by His side; A strong, pure, spotless bride.
 
[C]
.D       C            G                D
 We will dance on the streets that are golden
.    D        C             G            D
 The glorious bride and the great Son of man,
.     D     C          G         D
 From every tongue and tribe and nation
.     C G                     D
 Will join in the song of the Lamb.

[B]
.D
 Sing aloud for the time of rejoicing is near.
 (Women echo)
.    D
 The risen King, our groom is soon to appear.
 (Women echo)||
.    D
 The wedding feast to come is now near at hand.
 (Women echo)
.     D
 Lift up your voice, proclaim the coming Lamb.

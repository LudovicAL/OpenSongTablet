 Your mercy taught us how to dance,|To celebrate with all we have
.          G                      D
 And we'll dance to thank You for mercy||

 Your glory taught us how to shout,|To lift Your name in all the earth
.          G                           D
 And we'll shout to the praise of Your glory

[P]

 It's the overflow of a forgiven soul
.              G                 A
 And now we've seen You God,|Our hearts cannot stay silent

 Dancing because of Your great mercy Lord,|Your great mercy Lord||

 And we'll be a shouting generation

.G                 D                      C
 I'm giving You my heart, and all that is within
.         D   Em                   D/F#   G
 I lay it all down for the sake of You my King
.                   D                         C
 I'm giving You my dreams, I'm laying down my rights
.           D     Em                    D/F#   G
 I'm giving up my pride for the promise of new life
 
[C]
.    Em D/F#   G       C      G    Em7    D   C
 And I       surrender all to You, all to You
.    Em D/F#   G       C      G    Em7    D   C
 And I       surrender all to You, all to You
 
[V2]
.G                    D                        C
 I'm singing You this song, I'm waiting at the cross
.            D           Em               D/F#   G
 And all the world holds dear, I count it all as loss
.                        D                      C
 For the sake of knowing You, the glory of Your Name
.            D       Em                D/F#    G
 To know the lasting joy, even sharing in Your pain</lyrics></song>

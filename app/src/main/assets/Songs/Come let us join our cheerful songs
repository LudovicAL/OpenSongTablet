  <lyrics>[V1]
.Bb           F        Gm       D7
 Come, let us join our cheerful songs
.     Gm     Eb        Bb  F
 With angels round the throne;
.Bb  Eb       Bb       Eb        Gm
 Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
.F   Bb        Eb   F7  Bb
 But all their joys are one.
 
[V2]
 'Worthy the Lamb that died,' they cry,
 'To be exalted thus.'
 'Worthy the Lamb,' our lips reply,
 'For He was slain for us.'
 
[V3]
 Jesus is worthy to receive
 Honour and power divine:
 And blessings, more than we can give,
 Be, Lord, forever Thine.
 
[V4]
 Let all that dwell above the sky,
 And air, and earth, and seas,
 Conspire to lift Thy glories high,
 And speak Thine endless praise.
 
[V5]
 The whole creation join in one
 To bless the sacred name
 Of Him that sits upon the throne
 And to adore the Lamb.</lyrics>

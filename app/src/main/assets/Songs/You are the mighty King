  <lyrics>[V1]
.Ab   Bb       Eb      Cm    Ab   Bb      Eb   Eb7
 You are the mighty king, the living Word;
.Ab  Bb      Eb    Cm     Fm7 Bb       Eb
 Master of everything, You are the Lord.

[C1]
.Fm7   Bb           Eb  Eb7
 And I praise Your name,
.Fm7   Bb           Eb  Eb7
 And I praise Your name.

[V2]
 You are Almighty God, Saviour and Lord; 
 Wonderful Counsellor, You are the Lord.

[V3]
 You are the Prince of Peace, Emmanuel; 
 Everlasting Father, You are the Lord.

[C2]
 And I love Your name, 
 And I love Your name.

[V4]
 You are the Mighty King, the living Word; 
 Master of everything, You are the Lord.

 Praise my soul, the King of heaven

 Praise the everlasting King

[V2]
 Praise Him for His grace and favour,
 To our fathers in distress
 Praise Him, still the same forever,
 Slow to chide and quick to bless
 Praise Him! Praise Him!|Praise Him! Praise Him!
 Glorious in His faithfulness.

[V3]
 Father-like, He tends and spares us;
 Well our feeble frame He knows
 In His hands He gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes
 Praise Him! Praise Him!|Praise Him! Praise Him!
 Widely as His mercy flows

[V4]
 Angels in the height, adore Him;
 Ye behold Him  face to face;
 Sun and moon, bow down before Him,
 Dwellers all in time and space.
 Praise Him! Praise Him!|Praise Him! Praise Him!
 Praise with us the God of grace!</lyrics>

.Eb2                      Bb2
 I will bless the Lord forever
.Eb2                     Bb2
 I will trust Him at all times
.Eb2                          Bb2
 He has delivered me from all fear
.Eb                        Bb
 He has set my feet upon a rock
.Eb
 I will not be moved
.Cm                  F
 And I'll say of the Lord
 
[C]
.           Bb         Cm
 You are my shield, my strength
.   Eb         F
 My portion, deliverer
.   Bb              Bb/D
 My shelter, strong tower
.   Eb           F               Eb2...
 My very present help in time of need
 
[V2]
.Eb2                      Bb2
 Whom have I in heaven but You
.Eb2                      Bb2
 There's none I desire beside You
.Eb2
 You have made me glad
.Cm                  F
 And I'll say of the Lord</lyrics></song>

  <lyrics>[V1]
 Take us to the river
 Take us there in unity to sing
 A song of your salvation
 To win this generation for our King
 A song of your forgiveness
 For it is with grace that river flows
 Take us to the river
 In the city of our God

[V2]
 Take us to your throne room
 Give us ears to hear the cry of heaven
 For that cry is mercy
 Mercy to the fallen sons of man
 For mercy it has triumphed
 Triumphed over judgement by your 
 Take us to the throne room
 In the city of our God

[C]
 For the spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us
 This is the year of the Lord
 The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us
 This is the year of the Lord

[V3]
 Take us to the mountain
 Lift us in the shadow of Your hands
 Is this your might angel
 Who stands astride the ocean and the land
 For in His hand your mercy
 Showers on a dry and barren place
 Take us to the mountain
 In the city of our God

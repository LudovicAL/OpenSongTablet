[Intro]
.G    D      A        D

[V1]
.D      D7     G      D 
 Jesus, Jesus, born today,
.G    D      A        D
 In a stable near the hay.
.D        G      D    A7
 You're a special baby boy,
.D          G       D        A7
 You're the Saviour bringing joy
.D      D7     G      D 
 Jesus, Jesus, born today,
.G    D      A        D
 In a stable near the hay.

[V2]
 In a manger full of hay,|That's where baby Jesus lay.
 Mary laid Him down to sleep,|In a food box meant for sheep.
 In a manger full of hay,|That's where baby Jesus lay.

[V3]
 Shepherds in the fields at night,|Saw a very wondrous sight.
 Angels came from heaven above,|Told the shepherds of God's love.
 Baby Jesus, born that day,|Sleeping on a bed of hay.

[V4]
 Wise men watching stars at night|Saw a new star shining bright.
 Followed it to find a King,|Precious gifts for Him they bring.
 Bowing low they worship Him,|Baby Jesus, King of Kings.</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.Gm              Bb               Eb
 My soul is weak, my heart is numb, I cannot see
.Gm              Bb             Eb
 But still my hope is found in You
.Gm               Bb             Eb
 I’ll hold on tightly, You will never let me go
.Cm          Bb               F
 For Jesus, You will never fail
.Cm          Bb           F
 Jesus, You will never fail
 
[C]
.Bb
 Simply to the cross I cling
.F                           Cm
 Letting go of all earthly things
.     Eb           F
 Clinging to the cross
.Bb
 Mercy’s found a way for me
.F
 Hope is here as I am free
.Cm
 Jesus, You are all I need
.     Eb           F
 Clinging to the cross
 
[V2]
 Even darkness is as light to You, my Lord
 So light the way and lead me home
 To that place where every tear is wiped away
 For Jesus, You will never fail
 Jesus, You will never fail
 
[B]
.        Gm  Bb           Eb
 What a Saviour, what a story
.            Gm  Bb        Eb
 You were crucified but now You are alive</lyrics>

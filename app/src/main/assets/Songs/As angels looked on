.B  F#/A#  G#m7  E

[V1]
.B                   F#/A#                G#m7
 As angels looked on You humbled Yourself
.G#m/F#                E
 Gave up Your glorious throne
.B                F#/A#                G#m7
 Obedient to God, You came to the Earth
.G#m7/F#                E
 Full of compassion for us
.C#m7       G#m7           F# 
 What can I do before such love?
.E       F#        G#m7
 To Your majesty I bow

[C]
.             E       B  E B/D#        G#m7   F#/A# B       F#
 You are the Almighty One, You will be adored in    all the Earth
.B/D#         E      B  E C#m7         F#  G#m7  F#/A#
 No-one is as wonderful,  wonderful as You

[V3]
 Your great sacrifice, You gave up Your life
 Such was Your passion for us
 But God raised You up and now heaven sings
 In praise of Your glorious cross
 What can I do before such power?
 To Your majesty I bow

[B]
.E      B     E      G#m7  F#
 We bow down, we bow down
.E      G#m7            F#
 We bow down before You Lord</lyrics>

.               D                    A/C#
 Jesus, You are mercy, Jesus You are justice
.               G       A                D
 Jesus, You are worthy, that is what You are.
.                  D                              A/C#
 You died alone to save me, You rose so You could raise me
.                    G         A               D
 You did this all to make me a chosen child of God
 
[C]
.              G         A        D
 Worthy is the Lamb that once was slain
.               G      A         D
 To receive all glory, power and praise.
.                        G         A      Bm
 For with Your blood You purchased us for God;
.               G       A                D
 Jesus, You are worthy, that is what you are.
 
[B]
.             Em                      Bm
 Perfect sacrifice, crushed by God for us.
.                G                  A
 Bearing in Your hurt all that I deserve.
.                Em                           Bm
 Misjudged for my misdeeds, You suffered silently
.                   G                 A
 The only guiltless man in all of history</lyrics>

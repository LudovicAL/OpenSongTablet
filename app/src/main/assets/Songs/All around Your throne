  <lyrics>[V1]
 All around your throne
 Rainbow colours fly through light
 Heavy thunder rolls
 And the lightening blinds so bright
 
[V2]
 Living creatures cry "Holy is the Lord"
 As they try to hide their eyes
 You shine brighter than the sun,
 Only Holy One, and you shine on me
 
[V3]
 Jesus, only Risen Son, seated on your throne
 Would you shine on me today
 Rulers of this world
 Only join in vain as one
 
[V4]
 There's no other power
 Could ever overthrow the Son
 Principalities and powers know that you are Lord
 And they try to hide their eyes
 
[V5]
 You shine brighter than the sun,
 Only Holy One, and you shine on me
 Jesus, only Risen Son, seated on your throne
 Would you shine on me today
 
[V6]
 There will be a day
 When the stars will leave the sky
 Heaven and earth will shake
 And the moon will give no light
 While every tongue will cry "Jesus Christ is Lord"
 Some will try to hide their eyes.</lyrics>

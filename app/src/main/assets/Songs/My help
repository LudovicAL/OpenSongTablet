  <lyrics>[V1]
 Where do I go when I’m feeling down
 Who do I call when friends aren’t around
 I look to the lifter of my head
 Jesus my Saviour Lord and Friend

[C]
 I will lift up mine eyes to the hill
 From whence cometh my help
 My help cometh from the Lord
 Who heaven and earth
 (repeat)

[V2]
 He will not suffer my foot to be moved
 The one who keeps me will watch over you
 Trust in the Lord believe have faith
 Lift up your voice to Him and say

[B]
 My help cometh from the Lord
 Who made heaven and earth
 (repeat x4)

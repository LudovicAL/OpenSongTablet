.D          G                 D
 Colours of day dawn into the mind,
.                 A7               D
 The sun has come up, the night is behind.
.               G              D
 Go down in the city, into the street,
.                   A7                       D
 And let's give the message to the people we meet.

[C]
.                G                      D
 So light up the fire and let the flame burn,
.         A7                D
 Open the door, let Jesus return.
.                  G                     D
 Take seeds of His Spirit, let the fruit grow,
.                   A7                  D
 Tell the people of Jesus, let His love show.
 
[V2]
 Go through the park, on into the town;
 The sun still shines on, it never goes down.
 The light of the world is risen again;
 The people of darkness are needing a friend.

[V3]
 Open your eyes, look into the sky,
 The darkness has come, the sun came todie.
 The evening draws on, the sun disappears,
 But Jesus is living, His Spirit is near.</lyrics>

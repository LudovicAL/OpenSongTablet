[V1]
 Alleluia! sing to Jesus!
 His the scepter, His the throne;
 Alleluia! His the triumph,
 His the victory alone;
 Hark! the songs of peaceful Sion
 Thunder like a mighty flood;
 Jesus out of every nation
 Hath redeemed us by His blood.

[V2]
 Alleluia! not as orphans
 Are we left in sorrow now;
 Alleluia! He is near us,
 Faith believes, nor questions how:
 Though the cloud from sight received Him,
 When the forty days were o'er,
 Shall our hearts forget His promise,
 "I am with you evermore"?

[V3]
 Alleluia! Bread of heaven,
 Thou on earth our food, our stay!
 Alleluia! here the sinful
 Flee to Thee from day to day:
 Intercessor, Friend of sinners,
 Earth's Redeemer plead for me,
 Where the songs of all the sinless
 Sweep across the crystal sea.

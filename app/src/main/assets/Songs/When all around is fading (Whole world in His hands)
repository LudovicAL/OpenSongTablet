  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em9                Bm7
 When all around is fading
.Em9                  Bm7
 And nothing seems to last
.Em9                          Bm7
 When each day is filled with sorrow
.        D                Bm7  A
 Still I know with all my heart
 
[C]
.D            G                  A
 He's got the whole world in his hands
.D            G                  A
 He's got the whole world in his hands
.             Bm
 I'll fear no evil
.             G
 For you are with me
.             F#
 Strong to deliver
.          G
 Mighty to save
.F#m                                 A
 He's got the Whole world in his hands
 
[V2]
 When I walk through fire
 I will not be Burned
 When the waves come crashing round me
 Still I know with all my heart</lyrics>

  <lyrics>[V1]
.G       D  G       Am D7     G        C D      G      D/A A      D
 And can it be that I  should gain,|an interest in the Saviour's blood?
.D       G       D   G          D     G   C       G            D  G
 Died He for me, who caused His pain?|For me, who Him to death pursued?
.  D     G     D G C   A7 D   
 Amazing love, how can it be
.     G       C           D       G     
 That thou my Lord should die for me?

[C]
. D            D7  G         C
 Amazing love, how can it be
.             G   Am       G   D7  G
 That thou my God shouldst die for me?

[V2]
 'Tis mystery all!  The immortal dies:|Who can explore His strange design?
 In vain the first-born seraph tries|To sound the depths of love divine!
 'Tis mercy all! Let earth adore,
 Let angel minds inquire no more.

[V3]
 He left His Father's throne above,|So free, so infinite His grace;
 Emptied Himself of all but love,|And bled for Adam's helpless race;
 'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
 For, O my God, it found out me.

[V4]
 Long my imprisoned spirit lay,|Fast bound in sin and nature's night,
 Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,|I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
 My chains fell off, my heart was free,
 I rose, went forth and followed thee.

[V5]
 No condemnation now  I dread,|Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;
 Alive in Him, my living Head|and clothed with righteousness divine,
 Bold I approach the eternal throne,
 And claim the crown through Christ, my own.</lyrics>

[V1]
.Em   B7 Em    B7     Em
 Bring a psalm to the Lord,
.     B7  Em         F#m7b5    B7
 From the Spirit and from  His word.
.Am        B7    An    B7
 Lift your voice and rejoice,
.Am               B7 Am  C
 For our God is a mighty King,
.   B7       Em   B7   Em
 So come and clap your hands,
.     B7 Em     E  B7 E                Am
 Raise a shout, as we stand before the Lord,
.                   D7          G             Em
 For the Lord is He who has the power to free,
.           F#m7b5     B7                 Em  
 Who by His mighty arm gives strength and victory.
.Em       Am          D7
 So as we hail the King
.             B7           Em
 Then let His praises ring,
.            F#m7b5       B7         Em
 And bring a psalm of joy before the Lord.

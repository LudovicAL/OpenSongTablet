.C#m7  D  E

[V1]
.C#m7   D           E         A       D   A
 All my days I will sing this song of gladness
.C#m7    D             E        A    D 
 Give my praise to the Fountain of delights
.    Bm D  E                Bm    D  E
 For in my helplessness You heard my cry
.    Bm    D  E                       F# B
 And waves of mercy poured down on my life

[V2]
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer
 I will sing of the blood that never fails
 Of sins forgiven, of conscience cleansed
 Of death defeated and life without end

[C]
.          E      A           B      E
 Beautiful Saviour, Wonderful Counsellor
.           F#m              F#m/E
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
.           B/D#     C#m7       B/E#
 You're the Way, the Truth, the Life
.            E      A             B/D# E
 Star of the Morning, glorious in holiness
.           F#m                 F#m/E
 You're the Risen One, heaven's Champion
.        B/D#   C#m7 B         C#m7  D  E
 And You reign, You reign over all

[V3]
 I long to be where the praise is never-ending
 Yearn to dwell where the glory never fades
 Where countless worshippers will share one song
 And cries of 'worthy' will honour the Lamb</lyrics>

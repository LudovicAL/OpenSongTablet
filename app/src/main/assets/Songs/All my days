.Dm7  Eb  F

[V1]
.Dm7    Eb2  Eb     F         Bb/D    Eb   Bb
 All my days I will sing this song of gladness
.Dm7     Eb2    Eb     F        Bb/D  Eb 
 Give my praise to the Fountain of  delights
.    Cm7 Ebmaj7  F                Eb    Bb/D F
 For in  my      helplessness You heard my   cry
.    Cm7   Ebmaj7 Dm7                     G/B C
 And waves of     mercy poured down on my life

[V2]
.Dm7    Eb2  Eb     F         Bb/D    Eb   Bb
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer

 I will sing of the blood that never fails
.   Cm7  Ebmaj7 F     Eb Bb/D    F
 Of sins forgiven, of conscience cleansed
.   Cm7   Ebmaj7 Dm7                G/B C
 Of death defeated and life without end

[C]

 Beautiful Saviour, Wonderful Counsellor

 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
.           C/E     Dm7       C
 You're the Way, the Truth, the Life
.C/Bb        F/A    Bb            C C/E F
 Star of the Morning, glorious in holiness

 You're the Risen One, heaven's Champion

 And You reign, You reign over all

[V3]
.Dm7    Eb2 Eb          F         Bb/D  Eb  Bb
 I long to be where the praise is never-ending
.Dm7      Eb2  Eb         F     Bb/D  Eb 
 Yearn to dwell where the glory never fades
.      Cm7 Ebmaj7 F               Eb    Bb/D F
 Where countless worshippers will share one song
.    Cm7   Ebmaj7 Dm7                  G/B C
 And cries of 'worthy' will honour the Lamb

  <lyrics>[Intro]
.Dm7  Eb  F

[V1]
.Dm7   Eb           F         Bb       Eb   Bb
 All my days I will sing this song of gladness
.Dm7    Eb             F        Bb    Eb 
 Give my praise to the Fountain of delights
.    Cm Eb  F                Cm    Eb  F
 For in my helplessness You heard my cry
.    Cm    Eb  F                       G C
 And waves of mercy poured down on my life

[V2]
 I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer
 I will sing of the blood that never fails
 Of sins forgiven, of conscience cleansed
 Of death defeated and life without end

[C]
.          F      Bb           C      F
 Beautiful Saviour, Wonderful Counsellor
.           Gm              Gm/F
 Clothed in majesty, Lord of history
.           C/E     Dm7       C/Gb
 You're the Way, the Truth, the Life
.            F      Bb             C/E F
 Star of the Morning, glorious in holiness
.           Gm                 Gm/F
 You're the Risen One, heaven's Champion
.        C/E   Dm7 C         Dm7  Eb  F
 And You reign, You reign over all

[V3]
 I long to be where the praise is never-ending
 Yearn to dwell where the glory never fades
 Where countless worshippers will share one song
 And cries of 'worthy' will honour the Lamb

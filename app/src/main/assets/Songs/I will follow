.Em7                      C/E                  
    Where You go, I'll go;    Where You stay, I'll stay;
.G/D                         D                 Em7   C2    G      D

 All Your ways are good,  all Your ways are sure; I will trust in You alone
.C                    Em7                  D

 I will trust in You alone. In You alone

.G                           D                   
    When You move, I'll move.  I will follow You.
.Em7                         C2
    Whom You love, I'll love;  How You serve, I'll serve;
.G                      D                  Em7     C2                  G     D
    If this life I lose,  I will follow You,  yeah,  I will follow You, yeah

 Light into the world, light into my life, I will live for You alone
 You're the One I seek, knowing I will find
 All I need in You alone.  In You alone

 When You move, I'll move.  I will follow You.
 Whom You love, I'll love;  How You serve, I'll serve;
 If this life I lose,  I will follow
 Where You go, I'll go; Where you stay I'll stay;
 When You move, I'll move.  I will follow You.
 Whom You love, I'll love;  How You serve, I'll serve;
 If this life I lose,  I will follow You, yeah, I will follow You, yeah
 I will follow You, yeah, I will follow You, yeah</lyrics>

 The Lord, He has done good things,|His ways are true, His Word is flawless.
 He will be my shield and refuge, |Who is there beside You Lord?||
 He will be my strength,|He trains my hand|And He sustains me.
 Lord I give to You| My hope, my joy, my tears, my sadness.
 Lord, I trust in You,|I trust in You.

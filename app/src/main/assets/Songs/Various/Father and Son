;Father
.         G              D              C            Am7
 It's not time to make a change, just relax, take it easy
.             G                  Em                Am               D
 you're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to know
.       G            D            C             Am7
 Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry
.        G        Em           Am     D
 Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  

.      G                 D          C                    Am7
 I was once like you are now, and I know that's it's not easy
.      G                Em              Am       D
 to be calm when you've found something going on 
.              G             D             C                 Am7
 But take your time, think a lot, think of everything you've got
.             G               Em               D          G     C
 for you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not   

;Son
.        G          D             C            Am7
 How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again
.     G               Em             Am      D
 It's always been the same, same old story.  
.         G              D           C          Am7
 From the moment I could talk, I was ordered to listen
.              G         Em          D       G          D      C       G  C
 now there's a way and I know that I have to go away. I know I have to go 

;Father
.         G              D              C            Am7
 It's not time to make a change, just relax, take it slowly
.             G                  Em                Am               D
 you're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to go through
.       G            D            C             Am7
 Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry
.        G        Em           Am     D
 Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  

;Son
.        G               D             C                Am7
 All the times that I've tried keeping all the things I knew inside
.     G             Em         Am        D
 It's hard but it's harder to ignore it  
.             G           D              C                  Am7
 If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know not me
.              G         Em          D       G          D      C       G
 now there's a way and I know that I have to go away. I know I have to go</lyrics>

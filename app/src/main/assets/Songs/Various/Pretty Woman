.A                    F#m              A                       F#m
 Pretty woman walking down the street, pretty woman the kind I like to meet
.       D              E                             E
 Pretty woman, I can't believe it, you must be true, no one could look as good as you

.A                   F#m        A                     F#m
 Pretty woman please pardon me, pretty woman couldn't help but see
.       D               E                 E
 Pretty woman, you look lovely as can be, are you lonely just like me?

;Chorus
.Dm           G             Cm           Am
 Pretty woman walk a while, pretty woman talk a while
.Dm           G                  C
 Pretty woman give your smile to me
.Dm           G                 Cm           Am
 Pretty woman yeah, yeah, yeah, pretty woman look my way
.Dm           G                    C
 Pretty woman say you'll stay with me
.        A                        F#m
 Cause I need you, I'll treat you right
.A                       E
 Come on baby, be mine tonight

.A                  F#m         A                  F#m
 Pretty woman don't walk on by, pretty woman don't make me cry
.D                   E                          E
 Pretty woman, don't walk away, hey, it's okay, if that's the way it must be okay

;Spoken over main riff
 I'll just go on home it's late, there'll be another night but wait
 What do I see?  She's walking up to me...
 Now she's walking next to me... oh pretty woman</lyrics>

.A                 F#m  C#m  B
 Spanish Bombs in Andalusia  
.                          Dm
 The shooting sites in the days of '39

 Oh, please leave the vendetta open
.Bm                 Dm
 Federico Lorca is dead and gone
.A                   F#m      C#m
 Bullet Holes in the cemetary walls
.Bm                    Dm
 The black cars of the Guardia Civil
.A              F#m         C#m
 Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
.Bm                 Dm
 I'm flying in on a DC-10 tonight

 Spanish weeks in my disco casino
 The freedom fighters died up on the hill
 They sang the red flag, they wore th black one
 But after they died it was Mockingbird Hill
 Back home the buses went up in flashes
 The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
 Spanish bombs shatter the hotel
 My senorita's nose was nipped in the bud

;Chorus

 The hillsides ring with,"Free the people"
 Or can I hear the echoes from the days of '39?
 With trenches full of poets, the ragged armies
 Fixin' bayonets, to fight the other line
 Spanish bombs rock the province
 I'm hearing music from another time
 Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
 I'm flying in on a DC-10 tonight

 Chorus add at end...
.A                F#m  C#m/E F#m  C#m/E
 Spanish songs in Andalusia, Mandalina
.   G/D
 Oh my corazon
.A             F#m  C#m/E  F#m C#m/E
 Spanish songs in Granada  
.   G/D         A F#m Bm7 Dm
 Oh my corazon</lyrics>

[Intro]  Am  Am/B  C  C/D   F  F1  (two times)

.Am            Am/B          C              F      F
   This is the place where I made my best mistakes 
.Am            Am/B       C                 D
   This is the place even angels don't understand
.Am              Am/B  C               F
   I've seen the disappointment in her face
.        D               Bm            C             D
 And the collection of engagement rings on her right hand
.Am         Am/B   C             F     F
   She sits alone apart from the crowd 
.     Am         Am/B       C               D
 In a white dress she wears like a question mark
.Am               Am/B  C
   Friends speak of her fondly
.                       F
 Enemies just think out loud
.                 D             Bm
 You think you're man enough to please her
.           C              D
 And you're fool enough to start
.G                               C              G
   You're not going to do a thing to our little angel
.D                                       C                    D
  There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change

 Now the cabaret is frozen and the laughter comes in cans
 And the lonely hearts club clientele don't know what to do
 with their hands
 You think that you'll be sweet to her but everybody knows
 That you're the marshmallow valentine that got stuck on her clothes
 You're not going to do a thing to our little angel
.                                                            F
 There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change

 Chords through solo: D   D   G   D   A   A   G   C   A

 So you mix your drinks and words
 You make bad jokes you make bad time
 The floors are there to walk over
 The walls are there to climb
 You swear you'll never go back again once you're inside
 You're never the bridegroom she's always the bride
 You're not going to do a thing to our little angel
 There's nothing you're thinking tonight that tomorrow won't change

.G                                      C         G
  You'll come in a sweetheart and you'll go out a stranger
.         D
 Well you try to love her but she's so contrary
 Like a chainsaw running through a dictionary
.                                        C           D  G
 So get your mind off the sweet behind of our little angel
.G
  You're not going to do a thing
 You're not going to do a thing
.                    Em        D
 You're not going to do a thing to our little angel

.E   Abm/Eb C#m B
             
.E   C#m B   B
             

.E                        C#m                B
 When I look into your eyes I can see a love restrained
.E                  C#m                                B
 But darlin' when I hold you Don't you know I feel the same
.       C#m           F#                                  B
 'Cause nothin' lasts forever And we both know hearts can change
.C#m                     F#                          B
 And it's hard to hold a candle In the cold November rain
.C#m                            F#                                     B
 We've been through this such a long long time Just tryin' to kill the pain
.    C#m                                     F#                                          B
 But lovers always come and lovers always go And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today

.                C#m                                                  F#
 Walking away If we could take the time to lay it on the line I could rest my head
.                           B                               C#m                        B
 Just knowin' that you were mine All mine So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain
.E                   C#m                          B           E                        F#         E                      F#
 Or I'll just end up walkin' In the cold November rain Do you need some time...on your own Do you need some time...all alone
.          E                  F#                              E                      F#
 Everybody needs some time... on their own Don't you know you need some time...all alone

.Ebm         E               B          Ebm       E                   C#m
 I know it's hard to keep an open heart When even friends seem out to harm you
.Ebm    E                C#m          Ebm      E              F#
 But if you could heal a broken heart Wouldn't time be out to charm you
.            E                      F#              E                      F#
 Sometimes I need some time...on my own Sometimes I need some time...all alone
.          E                           F#                     E                      F#
 Everybody needs some time... on their own Don't you know you need some time...all alone

 And when your fears subside And shadows still remain
 I know that you can love me  When there's no one left to blame
 So never mind the darkness We still can find a way
 'Cause nothin' lasts forever Even cold November rain</lyrics>

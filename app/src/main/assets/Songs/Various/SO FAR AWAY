.Dmaj9   D6
 So far away
.Dmaj9           D6           Gmaj7    G6
 doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?
.Em7            A11              Dmaj7 G Dmaj7
 it would be so fine to see your face at my door
.Gmaj7    F#m7 Em7   A11               Dmaj9  D6
 doesn't help to know that you're just time away
.Dmaj9       D6                       Gmaj7      G6
 Long ago I reached for you     and there you stood
.  Em7        A11                 Dmaj7 G Dmaj7
 holding you again could only    do me good
.Gmaj7 F#m7 Em7
 how I wish I could ,
.   A11           Dmaj9 D6
 but you're so    far away.

.Dmaj9 D      A
              

.Bm                   D                G       D
 One more song about moving along the highway  
.Em7                A11            Dmaj7
 can't say much of anything that's new
.F#m                                Em7
 if I could only work this life out my way
.    A11          Bm
 I'd rather spend it ,
.      Em7            A11
 being close to you   

.Dmaj7            D6
 but , you're so far away :||</lyrics>

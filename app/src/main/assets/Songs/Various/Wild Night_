.Em          Em-VII      G
            |           |           |    As you
.Em                                    G
 brush your shoes and stand before the mirror
.        Em                                    G
 And you comb your hair and grab your coat and hat
.        Em                               G
 and you walk the wet streets tryin' to remember
.Em         C                  D              G
    all the wild night breezes in your mem'ry  ever.

[C
.         Em                C                 Em                 C
 And ev'rything looks so complete when you're walkin' out on the street
.        Em                C                   D
 And the wind catches your feet and starts you flyin', cryin'
.Em      C    D    Em
    Ooooooooooooooowee!
.C           D        G
    the wild night is callin', all right-
.Em      C    D    Em
    Ooooooooooooooowee!
.C           D        G
    the wild night is callin'.

.            Em                                 G
 And all the girls walk by, dressed up for each other
.        Em                                             G
 and the boys do the boogie-woogie on the corner of the street
.        Em                                   G
 and the people passin' by just stare in wild wonder
.Em       C              D                   G
  and the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder.

;Chorus

.         Em                  G
 Well the wi-i-i-ild night is calling,
.    Em                  G
 The wi-i-i-ild night is calling,
.                Em                     G               Em
 Come on out and dance, come on out and make a little romance
.                C                             G
 Come on out and dance, come on out and make romance.

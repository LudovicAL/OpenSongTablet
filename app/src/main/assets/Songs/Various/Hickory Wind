.G            D7  C                    G
 In South Carolina there are many tall pines
.G              D7      C                G
 I remember the oak tree that we used to climb
.G                D7      C             G
 But now when I'm lonesome, I always pretend
.G                    D7  C           G
 That I'm getting the feel of hickory wind

 I started out younger at most everything
 All the riches and pleasures, what else could life bring?
 But it makes me feel better each time it begins
 Callin' me home, hickory wind

 It's hard to find out that trouble is real
 In a far away city, with a far away feel
 But it makes me feel better each time it begins
 Callin' me home, hickory wind

.G                D7  C         G
 Keeps callin' me home, hickory wind</lyrics>

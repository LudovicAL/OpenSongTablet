 {sonc}
.     Dm
 I am just an aging drummer boy
.            C
 And in the wars I used to play
.          Bb                               Dm
 And I've called the tune to many a torture  session

.         Dm
 Now they say I am a war criminal
.         C
 And I'm fading away,
. Bb                        Dm
 Father, please hear my confession

.        G
 I have legalised robbery
. D
 Called it belief
.        G
 I have run with the money
.        D
 I have hid like a thief
. G
 Rewritten history
.         D
 With my armys and my crooks
.D         C        Am7
 Invented memories  
.       D
 I did burn all those books

[C
.           Dm
 And I can still hear his laughter
.            C             Em  Em*
 And I can still hear his song 
.             Em
 The mans too big
.                D    C          D    C
 The mans too strong

.            G
 Well I've tried to be meek
.          D
 And I've tried to be mild
 But I spat like a woman
 And I sulked like a child
 I have lived behind walls
 Which have made me alone
 Striven for peace
 Which I never have know

;chorus

 Well the sun rose on the courtyard
 And they all did hear him say
 You always was a Judas
 But I got you anyway
 You may have got your silver
 But I swear upon my life
 Your sister gave me diamonds
 And I gave 'em to your wife

 Oh Father,please help me
 For I have done wrong
 The mans too big
 The mans too strong

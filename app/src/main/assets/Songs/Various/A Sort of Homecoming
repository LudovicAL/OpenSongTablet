;Intro:
.G6    D2    G6    D2    G6    D2    G6    D2
                                           

.        G6                   D2
 And you know it's time to go 
.                 G6                D2
 through the sleet and driving snow 
.           G6
 across the fields of mourning to a
.D2             G6       D4 D2
 light's in the distance  

.        G6                  D2
 And you hunger for the time 
.        G6                  D2
 time to heal, 'Desire', time
.         G6                 D2
 and your earth moves beneath
.         G6        D2
 your own dream landscape

.G      G2 G   G2            D2 D4 D Gii
 Oh, ho, ho on borderland we run________
.G             G2   G        G2
 I'll be there, I'll be there
.       D2  D4           D                Gii
 tonight, a high road, a high road out of here

 the city walls are all come down
 the dust a smoke screen all around to see
 faces ploughed like fields that once
 gave no resistance

 And we live by the side of the road
 on the side of a hill as the valleys explode
 dislocated, suffocated
 the land grows weary of it's own

.G6                 D2           G6                 D2
 O come away, o come away, o come, o come away I say I  hmm hmm
.G6                 D2           G6                 D2
 O come away, o come away, o come, o come away I say I

.G      G2 G   G2            D2       D4               D                     G
 Oh, ho, ho on borderland we run, and still we run, we run and don't look back
.G             G2   G        G2                D2  D4   D     D4
 I'll be there, I'll be there tonight    tonight      tonight 
.        C7
 I'll be there tonight, I believe.  I'll be there so high (land),
.                         D     D2     G6  D2
 I'll be there tonight, tonight____________

.G6                D2                G6                  D2
 O come away, I sing  I say, um ha,  o come away oh say. 

.                   G6
 The wind will crack in wintertime
.D2              G6
 this bomb-blast lightning waltz
.D2        G6            D2  G6        D4  D   G   G2     G   G2
 no spoken words, just a scream . . . yeah.... oh........ oh.....

.  D2          D4              D                     Gii
 tonight we'll build a bridge across the sea and land
.G              G2
 see the sky burning rain
.   G             G2           D2  D4 D Gii
 she will die and live again tonight_______

.G6   D2   G6   D4    D    G6   D2   G6   D4    D
                                                

 And you heart beats so slow
 through the rain and fallen snow
 across the fields of morning
 to a light that's in the distance
 Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep
 for tonight, at last
 I am coming home
 I am coming home</lyrics>

 Someone's gonna tell you lies
.D D
 Cut you down to size...

;Refrain:

 Don't do me like that, Don't do me like that

 Girl I love you baby,  Don't do me like that

 Someday I'll need ya baby, Don't do me like that

 Listen honey can you see, baby you'll bury me

 Someone's gonna tell you lies, Cut you down to size...

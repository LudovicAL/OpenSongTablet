. Em            Am       G        G/F#
 The walls are built up stone by stone
. Em            Am          G G/F#
 The fields divided one by one
. Em                      Am
 And the train conductor says
.        G            G/F#      Em       Am
 Take a break driver 8, driver 8 take a break
.            G                 G/F#
 We've been on this shift too long

. D         C                D
 And the train conductor says
.         C            D        C           D
 Take a break driver 8, driver 8 take a break
.         C              Em     Em/F#     Em/G    Em/F#   Em Em/F# Em/G Em/F#
 We can reach our destination, but we're still a ways away

 Saw a treehouse on the outskirts of the farm
 Power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged
 Bells are ringing through the town again
 Children look up all they hear is sky-blue bells ringing

. Am                    C
 Way to seal the hated heat
. G                     D
 Way to put myself to sleep
. Am                    C
 Way to seal the hated heat
. G                     D/Dsus4
 Way to put myself my children to sleep

 Pilot did this song in a plane like that one
 She is selling faith on a hotel crusade
 Locomotive 8, Southern Crescent hear the bells ring again
 This field of wheat is looking thin

 And the train conductor says
 Take a break driver 8, driver 8 take a break
 We've been on this shift too long</lyrics>

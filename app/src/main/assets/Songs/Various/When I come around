;intro:repeat 3 times
.EBC# A
    

.E   B                C#   A
   I heard you crying loud 
.E        B          C#    A
  all the way across town  
.       E                  B                C#            A
 you've searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
.   E         B              C#          A
 as you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

 Don't get lonely now
 dry your whining eyes
 I'm just roaming for the moment sleazin' my back yard
 so don't get so uptight you been thincking about ditching me

.F#                     A
  No time to search the world around
.F#                           A
 cause you know where I'll be found
.              E    BC# A
 when I come around   

;repeat intro 2 times

 I heard it all before
 so don't knock down my door
 I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
 to try slag me down because I know I'm right

 So go do what you like
 make sure you do it wise
 You may find out that your self doubt means nothing was ever there
 you can go forcing something if it's just not right

.F#                     A
  No time to search the world around
.F#                           A
 cause you know where I'll be found
;repeat 4 times
.              E    BC# A
 when I come around

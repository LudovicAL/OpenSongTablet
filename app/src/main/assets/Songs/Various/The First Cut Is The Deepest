.              C         G          F  G
 I would have given you all of my heart
.              C          G         F   G
 But there's someone who's torn it apart
.              C    G        F
 And she's taken all that I had
.     G                  C            G  F
 But, if you want, I'll try to love again
.G          C             F           G
 Baby I'll try to love again but I know

;Chorus :
.C          G          F
 The first cut is the deepest
.G          C             G              F G
 Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
.           C              G             FG
 When it comes to being lucky she's cursed
.C                       F            G
 When it comes to loving me she's worse

;Verse 2
 I still want you by my side
 Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
 And I'm sure gonna give you a try
 And, if you want, I'll try to love again
 Baby I'll try to love again but I know

;Chorus:</lyrics>

;Chorus
[C
.              C                Am
 Slip sliding away, slip sliding away
.              C                G          F               G      C
 You know the nearer your destination, the more you slip sliding away
[

.                   Am                    C
 Whoah and I know a man, he came from my hometown
.             F                            Fm
 He wore his passion for his woman like a thorny crown
.         C                 Am
 He said Dolores, I live in fear
.             C              G            F         G         C
 My love for you's so overpowering, I'm afraid that I will disappear

;chorus

 I know a woman, (who) became a wife
 These are the very words she uses to describe her life
 She said a good day ain't got no rain
 She said a bad day is when I lie in the bed
 And I think of things that might have been

;chorus

 And I know a father who had a son
 He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done
 He came a long way just to explain
 He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
 Then he turned around and he headed home again

;chorus

 Whoah God only knows, God makes his plan
 The information's unavailable to the mortal man
 We're workin' our jobs, collect our pay
 Believe we're gliding down the highway, when in fact we're slip sliding away

;chorus repeats 2x</lyrics>

;Atlantis
;Donovan Leitch

.C
 The continent of Atlantis was an island
.D
 Which lay before the great flood
.       F
 In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean.
.C                                  G
 So great an area of land, that from her western
.C
 shores, those beautifulsailors journeyed
.       D
 to the south and the North Americas with ease,
.         F                        C
 in their ships with painted sails.
.G           C
 To the east Africa was a neighbor across
.D
 a short strait of sea miles.
.F
 The great Egyptian age is but a
.    C              G
 remnant of the Atlantian culture.

.C
 The antedeluvian Kings colonised the world;
.D
 All the Gods who play a part in the
.F
 mythological dramas in all legends
.            C                           G
 from all  lands were from fair Atlantis.
.C
 Knowing her fate, Altantis sent out ships
.               D
 to all corners of the earth.
.D
 On board were the twelve, the poet,
.F
 the physician, the farmer, the scientist,
.        C
 the magician, and the other
.          G
 so called Gods of our legends.
.C
 Tho' Gods they were and as the elders
.       D
 of our time choose to remain blind,
.D
 let us rejoice and let us
.F                                  C
 sing and dance and ring in the new.

.             G
 Hail Atlantis!
.C                  D
 Way down below the ocean
.F               C
 where I wanna be
.        G
 she may be

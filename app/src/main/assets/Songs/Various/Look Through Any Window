;The Hollies

;verse 1:
. B                A
 Look through any window, yeah
. E   A       B
 What do you see
. B             A
 Smiling faces all around
. E         A           B
 Rushing through their busy towns

.               C#m
 (Where do they go...)  Movin' on their way
.                  E   B            E  B
 Walkin' down the highways and the byways
.               C#m
 (Where do they go...)  Movin' on their way
.                   E   B              E   B
 People with their shy ways and their sly ways

.F#                       B       E    F#
 You can see the little children all around
.                        B    G#m        E       F#
 You can see the little ladies in their gowns   when you

;verse 2:
 Look through any window, yeah
 Any time of day
 See the drivers on the roads
 Puttin' down their heavy loads

 (Where do they go...)  Movin' on their way
 Drivin' down the highways and the byways
 (Where do they go...)  Movin' on their way
 Drivers with their shy ways and their sly ways

 You can see the little children all around
 You can see the little ladies in their gowns   when you

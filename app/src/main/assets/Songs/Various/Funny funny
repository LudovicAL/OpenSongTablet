;INTRO

.E   A D    D E
 Ah  Ah---  Ah---

.E             B      E
 Tell me is it really true
.E                   B        E
 This feeling that I feel for you
.     A           B
 Your own kind of loving
.     E
 that makes me think nothing
.      A             B        E
 could ever take the place of you

;CHORUS
.         A        B
 And it's so funny funny
.         E
 what you do honey honey
.         A            B       E
 what you do, what you mean to me
.        A          B
 And you know honey honey
.          E
 tho' it's so funny funny
.         A            B        E
 that you mean all the world to me

.E   A D    D E
 Ah  Ah---  Ah---

 Ever since you came my way
 I knew it was my lucky day
 The sun started shining
 when you started smiling
 and I know it's gonna stay that way

;CHORUS

.A                               E
 Can't imagine loving anyone but you
.E
 (Honey honey, so funny funny)
.A                                  E
 Every minute loving everything you do

.A               E
 Couldn't see my way without you
.F                   B7
 Now I gotta tell the world about you

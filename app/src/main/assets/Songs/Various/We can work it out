;You asked for  just chords, but someone else might want the whole song.
;Glen Macon posted it this summer, but the lyrics were off as I recall.
;Anyway, here it is correct(I think) except that it is in G instead of D.

;Beatles
[V1]
.G             C  G     G            C               F               G
 Try to see it my way.  Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on
.G                C    G
 While you see it your way
.G               C                F                 G
 Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
.C              G    C              D
 We can work it out, we can work it out

[V2]
.G                    C  G
 Think of what you're saying
.G                C                   F                   G
 You can get it wrong and still you think that it's all right
.G                 C  G
 Think of what I'm saying
.G              C                F                 G
 We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight
.C              G    C              D
 We can work it out, we can work it out

;Chorus
.Em                                Am B
 Life is very short and there's no time
.B               Em          D  C  D
 For fussing and fighting my friend
.Em                                Am  B
 I have always thought that it's a crime
.B         Em      D     C   D
 So I will ask you once again

.G             C  G
 Try to see it my way
.G              C            F             G
 Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
.G                C    G
 While you see it your way
.G                     C              F               G
 There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
.C              G    C              D
 We can work it out, we can work it out

;Chorus

;Repeat 1st verse (end on G)</lyrics>

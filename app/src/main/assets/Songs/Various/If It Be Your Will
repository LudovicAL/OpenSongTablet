.E              F#m  D                C#m
  If it be your will, that I speak no more
.E                 F#m  A             E
  And my voice be still, as it was before
.C#m                 B       C#m           B
    I will speak no more, I shall abide until
.A             E          B
  I am spoken for, if it be your will
.E              F#m  D                C#m
  If it be your will, that a voice be true
.E                 F#m  A                E
  From this broken hill, I will sing to you
.C#m                  B              C#m                B
    From this broken hill, all your praises they shall ring
.A               E        B
  If it be your will, to let me sing

.C#m                  B              C#m                B
    From this broken hill, all your praises they shall ring
.A               E        B
  If it be your will, to let me sing
.E              F#m  D               C#m
  If it be your will, if there is a choice
.E               F#m  A                  E
  Let the rivers fill, let the hills rejoice
.C#m                 B                 C#m                B
    Let your mercy spill, on all these burning hearts in hell
.A               E        B
  If it be your will, to make us well
.E            F#m  D             C#m
  And draw us near, and bind us tight
.E                  F#m  A                   E
  All your children here, in their rags of light
.C#m                 B  C#m                B
    In our rags of light,  all dressed to kill
.A               E           B                           E
  And end this night, if it be your will, if it be your will</lyrics>

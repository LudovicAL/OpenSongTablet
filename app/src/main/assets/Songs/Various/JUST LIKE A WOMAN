.C      F     G   C
 Nobody feels any pain
.C            F     G          C
 Tonight as I stand inside the rain
.F         G          F              G
 Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
.    F   Em Dm C      F               G
 But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
.     Am     C        G
 Have fallen from her curls

.    C     Em          F
 She takes just like a woman, yes she does
.    C          Em          F
 She makes love just like a woman, yes she does
.        C     Em          F
 And she aches just like a woman
.        G                             C
 But she breaks just like a little girl.

 Queen Mary, she's my friend
 Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
 Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
 Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest
 With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.

;CHORUS

.E7
 It was rainin' from the first and I was dying there of thirst
.     C
 So I came in here
.E7
 And your longtime curse hurts but what's worse
.        F                     Dm
 Is this pain in here, I can't stay in here,
.F
 Ain't it clear

 That I just can't fit
 Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
 When we meet again introduced as friends
 Please don't let on that you knew me when
 I was hungry and it was your world.

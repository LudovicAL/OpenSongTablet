.G      D          C     G
 In the town where I was born
.Em      Am      Cmaj7      D
 Lived a man who sailed the sea.
.G      D       C      G
 And he told us of his life
.Em     Am      Cmaj7D
 In the land of submarines.

.G     D         C      G
 So we sailed up to the sun
.Em      Am        Cmaj7  D
 Till we found the sea of green,
.G      D       C         G
 And we lived beneath the waves
.Em     Am     Cmaj7D
 In our yellow submarine.

[C
.G                D
 We all live in a yellow submarine,
.                  G
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
.                 D
 We all live in a yellow submarine,
.                  G
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
[

.        D           C      G
 And our friends are all on board,
.Em   Am           Cmaj7     D
 Many more of them live next door,
.G       D      C       G
 And the band begins to play

[C
.G                D
 We all live in a yellow submarine,
.                  G
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
.                 D
 We all live in a yellow submarine,
.                  G
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
[

.      D      C       G
 As we live a life of ease,
.Em    Am        Cmaj7      D
 Every one of us has all we need.
.G      D        C      G
 Sky of blue and sea of green
.Em     Am     Cmaj7D
 In our yellow submarine.

[C
.G                D
 We all live in a yellow submarine,
.                  G
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
.                 D
 We all live in a yellow submarine,
.                  G
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

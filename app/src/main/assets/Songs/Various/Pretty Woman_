;Intro:

.E      A              F#m                    A                 F#m
 Pretty woman, walking down the street/Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet
.       D                E
 Pretty woman, I don't believe you; you're not true
 No one could look as good as you

.       A                F#m              A                 F#m
 Pretty woman, won't you pardon me/Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see
.       D               E
 Pretty woman, you look lovely as can be
 Are you lonely just like me?

.Dm            G            C             Am
 Pretty woman, stop a while/Pretty woman, talk a while
.Dm                               C
 Pretty woman, give your smile to me
.Dm            G              C             Am
 Pretty woman, yeah yeah yeah/Pretty woman, walk my way
.Dm            G                    C
 Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me

.A            F#m            D         E
 Oh, 'cause I need you; I'll treat you right
.A            F#m      D      E
 Come with me baby; be mine tonight

.       A            F#m               A            F#m
 Pretty woman, don't walk on by/Pretty woman, don't make me cry
.       A            E
 Pretty woman, don't walk away, hey... okay

.              E
 If that's the way it must be then okay
 I guess I'll go on home; it's late; there'll be tomorrow night, but wait...
 What do I see?  Is she walking back to me?  Yeah, she's walking back to me...
 Oh, oh,
.       A

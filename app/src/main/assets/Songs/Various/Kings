.D        F       Am         D       F       Am
 Now they lay his body down, sad old men who run this town
.F              C              Gm7                  F   C/E
 I still recall the way he led the charge and saved the day
.G/D  D7            G/D  D7  C/Bb  Bb       Am
 Blue blood and rain,        I can hear the bugle playin

;Chorus
.Em7                 F            C      G    C/G
 We've seen the last of good King Richard     
.Dm7                G              Am
 Ring out the past, his name lives on and on
.Em7                 F                 C      G    C/G
 Roll out the bones, and raise up your pitcher     
.Dm7                 G            F
 Raise up your glass to good King John uh huh

.D        F         Am            D       F        Am
 While he plundered far and wide, all his starving children cried
.F                  C               Gm7              F   C/E
 And though we sung his fame we all went hungry just the same
.G/D  D7            G/D  D7  C/Bb   Bb         Am
 He   meant to shine         to the end of the line

.Em7                 F            C      G    C/G
 We've seen the last of good King Richard     
.Dm7                G              Am
 Ring out the past, his name lives on and on
.Em7                 F                 C      G    C/G
 Roll out the bones, and raise up your pitcher     
.Dm7                 G            F
 Raise up your glass to good King John uh huh
.Dm7                 G            Am
 Raise up your glass to good King John
.Dm7                 G            Am
 Raise up your glass to good King John</lyrics>

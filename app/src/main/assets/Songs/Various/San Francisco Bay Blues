.        C                         F                 C          C7
 Got the Blues from my Baby hangin out by the Frisco Bay        
.F                    F                 C        C7
 Ocean Liner come and took her so far away       
.F                           G#dim
 Didn't mean to treat her so bad,
.            C          B    Bb  A
 She was the Best gal I ever had had,
.D
 Said Goodbye, like to make me cry,
.G
 Wanna lay down my head and die,
.       C                        F                 C       C7
 Well I ain't got a nickel and I ain't got a lousy dime,   
.    F                                          E       E7
 She don't come back, I think I'm gonna lose my mind,   
.       F                 G#dim            C          B     Bb  A
 If she ever come back to stay, It's gonna be another brand new day,
.D                            G                      C       G
 Walkin with my baby down the south of San Francisco Bay.

.C           F      C           C                  F      C   C7
 Sittin down on the back porch, don't know which-a way to go, 
.F                 F                        F           C
 Thinkin bout that woman of mine, she don't love me any mo.
.F                      G#dim          C         B   Bb A
 Think I'm gonna take a freight train, cause I'm feelin blue,
.D                    D                G
 Gonna ride it to the end of the line, thinkin only bout you,
.     C         F     C     C             F     C   C7
 Meanwhile in another city, just about to go insane,
.F              F                         E               E7
 Think I hear a woman's voice the way you used to call my name,
.       F                 G#dim            C          B     Bb  A
 If she ever come back to stay, it's gonna be another brand new day,
.D                             G                     C   B Bb A
 Walking with my baby down the south of San Franciso Bay      
.D                             G                     C
 Walking with my baby down the south of San Franciso Bay</lyrics>

;intro   G G G G

.G                      B
 Sitting in the morning sun
.        C                        A
 I'll be sitting when the evening comes
.G                  B
 Watching the ships roll in
.      C                    A
 And I watch 'em roll away again

[C
;Refrain
.G                          E7
 Sitting on the dock of the bay
.             G          E7
 Watching the tide roll away
.         G                          A7
 I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay
.        G    E7
 Wasting time 
[

.  G               B
 I left my home in Georgia
.       C               A
 Headed for the 'Frisco bay
.         G             E
 'Cause I had nothin to live for
.              C                       A
 And look like nothing's gonna come my way

 So I'm just...
;Refrain

.G    D    C7
 Look like nothing's gonna change
.G    D     C7
 Everything still remains the same
.G       D       C7              G
 I can't do what ten people tell me to do
.F                 D
 So I guess I'll remain the same

.G                      B
 Sittin here resting my bones
.         C                         A
 And this loneliness won't leave me alone
.     G                    B
 It's two thousand miles I roamed
.        C                 A
 Just to make this dock my home

 Now, I'm just...
;Refrain

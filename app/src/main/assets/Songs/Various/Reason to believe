.C    Am     G              C
 If I listen long enough to you
.            F        G                   Am
 I'll find a way to believe that it's all true
.D                G             F             C
 Knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
.        Am             G         D7
 Still I look to find a reason to believe

;Chorus
.F            G            Am           G                Am
 Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else
.F            G            Am           G                Am
 Someone like you makes it easy to give everything about myself

.C    Am       G                 C
 If I gave you time to change my mind,
.            F       G                Am
 I'll find a way to leave the past behind
.D                G              F             C
 knowing that you lied, straight faced while I cried
.        Am             G         D7
 still I look to find a reason to believe

.C    Am     G              C
 If I listen long enough to you
.            F            G              Am
 I'll find a way to believe that its all true
.D                G             F             C
 knowing that you lied straight faced while I cried
.        Am             G         D7
 still I look to find a reason to believe</lyrics>

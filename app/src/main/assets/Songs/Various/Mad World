.Em                  G
 All around me are familiar faces,
.D                A
 Worn out places, worn out faces,
.Em                         G
 Bright and early for their daily races,
.D              A
 Going nowhere, going nowhere,
.Em                          G
 And their tears are filling up their glasses,
.D              A
 No expression, no expression,
.Em                      G
 Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow,
.D            A
 No tomorrow, no tomorrow,

[C]
.Em                    A                        Em
 And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad,
.                        A                             Em
 The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've every had.
.                  A                                 Em
 I find it hard to tell you, cause I find it hard to take,
.                   A
 When people run in circles, it's a very, very
.Em       G   A
          Mad World (4 times)
[]

.Em                       G
 Children waiting for the day they feel good,
.D               A
 Happy birthday, happy birthday,
.Em                        G
 Made to feel the way that every child should
.D               A
 Sit and listen, sit and listen.
.Em                       G
 Went to school and I was very nervous,
.D               A
 No one knew me, no one knew me,
.Em                     G
 Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson,
.D                      A
 Look right through me, look right through me

;Chorus

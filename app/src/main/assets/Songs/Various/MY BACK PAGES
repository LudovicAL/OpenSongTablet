.E E5 E E5
        

.E       C#m         G#m                      A      B      E    E5
 Crimson flames tied through my ears, rollin' high &amp; mighty traps
.E            C#m     G#m                  A           B
 Pounced with fire on flaming roads, using ideas as my maps
. C#m                  G#m            A                   B
 "We'll meet on edges, soon," said I, proud 'neath heated brow.

[C]
.             E             A     E
 CHORUS:  Ah, but I was so much older then,
.    A       B         E   E5 E E5
 I'm younger than that now.

.E            C#m       G#m                A        B        E     E5
 Half�wracked prejudice leaped forth, "Rip down all hate," I screamed
.E         C#m     G#m                    A                 B
 Lies that life is black and white, spoke from my skull.  I dreamed
.C#m               G#m             A                  B
 Romantic facts of musketeers, foundationed deep, somehow

;CHORUS

 Girls' faces formed the forward path, from phony jealousy
 To memorizing politics, of ancient history
 Flung down by corpse evangelists, unthought of, though, somehow.

;CHORUS

 A self�ordained professor's tongue, too serious to fool
 Spouted out that liberty, is just equality in school
 "Equality," I spoke the word, as if a wedding vow.

;CHORUS

.E              C#m       G#m                   A       B        E   E5
 In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand, at the mongrel dogs who teach
.E                    C#m       G#m           A              B
 Fearing not that I'd become my enemy, in the instant that I preach
.C#m               G#m              A                    B
 My pathway led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow

;CHORUS

.E                   C#m       G#m                  A     B    E    E5
 Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats too nobel to neglect
.E           C#m  G#m             A               B
 Deceived me into thinking, I had something to protect
.C#m               G#m                     A                    B
 Good and bad, I define these terms, quite clear, no doubt, somehow.

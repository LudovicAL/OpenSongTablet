.D           A
 He's a real nowhere man,
.G              D
 Sitting in his nowhere land,
.G              Gm                D
 Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.

.D              A
 Doesn't have a point of view,
.G                    D
 Knows not where he's going to,
.G          Gm               D
 Isn't he a bit like you and me?

.         F#m        G
 Nowhere man, please listen,
.          F#m              G
 You don't know what you're missing,
.        F#m      G                      A7
 Nowhere man, the world is at your command.

.D                A
 He's as blind as he can be,
.G                 D
 Just sees what he wants to see,
.G               Gm            D
 Nowhere man can you see me at all?

.D              A
 Doesn't have a point of view,
.G                    D
 Knows not where he's going to,
.G          Gm               D
 Isn't he a bit like you and me?

.        F#m        G
 Nowhere man, don't worry,
.          F#m         G
 Take your time, don't hurry,
.         F#m       G             A7
 Leave it all 'till somebody else lends you a hand.

.D           A
 He's a real nowhere man,
.G              D
 Sitting in his nowhere land,
.G              Gm                G   D
 Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
.G              Gm                D
 Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.</lyrics>

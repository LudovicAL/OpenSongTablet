.F                  Bb  C
 Won't you be my number two
.F                 Bb  C
 Me and number one are through
.Am7                Gm7     C
 There won't be too much to do
.     Dm7               C
 just smile when I feel blue

.F                         Bb C
 And there's not much left of me
.F                    Bb  C
 What you get is what you see
.Am7             Gm7 C
 Is it worth the energy
.  Dm7            C
 I leave it up to you

.Bb  F          C            F
 And if you got something to say to me
.Bb    F          C        F
 Don't try to lay off only weights on me
.BbF              C          F
 I know that it's really not fair of me
.Bb9                C9
 But my heart seemed too much action

.F                     Bb C
 And every time I look at you
.F                    Bb  C
 you'll be who I want you to
.Am7              Gm7   C
 And I'll do what I can do
.   Dm7             C        Bb6
 To make a dream or two come true
.          Bb6              Gm7    F
 if you be my, if you be my number two.

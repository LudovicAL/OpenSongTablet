;Verse 1:
.Em                    D
 My Lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?
.Em                      D                   Bm
 I'll wake you tomorrow, and you will be my fill,
.                    Em
 yes you will be my fill.

;Verse 2:
 My Lady D'Arbanville, why does it grieve me so?
 But your heart seems so silent, why do you breathe so low?
 Why do you breathe so low?

;Repeat verse 1

;Verse 3:
 My Lady D'Arbanville, you look so cold tonight
 Your lips feel like winter, your skin has turned to white
 Your skin has turned to white.

;Repeat verse 1:
;Instrumental over verse
;Repeat verse 2:

;Verse 4:
 I loved you my lady, though in your grave you lie
 I'll always be with you, this rose will never die
 This rose will never die.</lyrics>

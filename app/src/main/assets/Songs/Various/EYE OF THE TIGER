;SURVIVOR

.Cm         Ab/C
 Risin' up, back on the street
.Bb/C                 Cm
 Did my time, took my chances
.Cm                         Ab/C
 Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
.          Bb/C                   Cm
 Just a man and his will to survive

.Cm                Ab/C
 So many times, it happens too fast
.Bb/C                            Cm
 You change your passion for glory
.Cm                          Ab/C
 Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
.         Bb/C                          C
 You must fight just to keep them alive 

;Chorus:
[C]
.Bb   Cm7 Fm                         Eb/G
 It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
.Bb     Cm7 Fm                         Cm7 Bb
     Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
.    Cm7 Fm                             Eb/G
 And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
.Bb      Cm7  Fm          Eb/G       Ab          Cm
     And he's watchin' us all in the eye of the tiger
[]

 Face to face, out in the heat
 Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
 They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
 For we kill with the skill to survive

;Chorus

 Risin' up, straight to the top
 Have the guts, got the glory
 Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
 Just a man and his will to survive

;Chorus

 The eye of the tiger  (repeats out)...</lyrics>

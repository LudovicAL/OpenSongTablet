. C                G               Am          Em
 Have you seen the old man in the closed down market,
. F               C               Dm7       G7
 Kicking out the papers with his worn out shoes?
.C                G              Am             Em
 In his eyes you see no pride.  Hanging loosely by his side,
. F           C             G7          C
 Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news.

[C
.    F           Em            G G7 Am
 So how can you tell me you're lonely,
.D           D7                     G     G7
 And say for you that the sun don't shine?
. C              G                Am                    Em
 Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London,
. F             C                 G                    C
 I'll show you something that'll make you change your mind.

.C                 G            Am                   Em
 Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of London?
.F           C            Dm7        G7
 Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags.
.C                 G                 Am             Em
 She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking,
.F            C       G7          C
 Carrying her home in two carrier bags.

;Chorus

.C                 G         Am         Em
 In the all night cafe at a quarter to eleven,
.F        C           Dm7          G7
 Same old man sitting there on his own.
.C               G             Am         Em
 Looking at the world over the rim of his tea cup,
.F                C             G7            C
 Each tea lasts a hour, then he wanders home alone.

;Chorus

.C                 G          Am                Em
 Have you seen the old man outside the seamen's mission?
.F             C                D7       G7
 Memory fading with the metal ribbons he wears.
.C             G        Am                  Em
 In our winter city the rain cries a little pitty,
.    F                  C         G7                 C
 For one more forgotten hero in a world that doesn't care.

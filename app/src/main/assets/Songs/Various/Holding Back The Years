.                 Em9   A
 Holding back the years 
.                Em9                  A
 Thinking of the fear I've had so long
.              Em9   A
 When somebody hears 
.              Em9              A
 Listen to the fear that's gone 
 Wrangled by the wishes of fater
 Open for the arms of mater
 Get to me but sooner or later

 Holding back the years
 Chance for me escape from all I'm gone
 Holding back the tears
 'Cause nothing here is wrong
 I've wasted all my tears
 Wasted all those years
 Nothing had the chance to be good
 Nothing ever could, yeah, oh, well

.Em7       A
 I'll keep holding on
.Em7       A
 I'll keep holding on
.Em7       A
 I'll keep holding on
.Em7       A
 I'll keep holding on, there's still time

 Well I've wasted all my tears
 Wasted all of those years
 And nothing had the chance to be good
 'Cause nothing ever could, oh, oh

 I'll keep holding on
 I'll keep holding on
 I'll keep holding on
 I'll keep holding on

 Holding, holding, holding ah la la la
 I say ooh yeah
 That's all I have today
 It's all I have to say</lyrics>

 Intro :  |: C G F C G :|

.C           D7       G7       E       Am G   F
 She took my hand and tried to make me un-der-stand
.               D7        G      D     G
 That she would always be there        
.C            D7  G7            E        Am G F
 But I looked away and she ran away from me today
.           D7     G    Em     Am
 I'm such a lonely man         

.Am            F           Fm7
 It came as no surprise to me
.Am                     F   Fm7
 That she'd leave me in misery
.Am            F           Fm7
 Seemed like only yesterday
.Fm7        Fm6      Fm7         Fm6 C
 She made a vow that she'd never go away

 She took my hand and tried to make me un-der-stand
 That she would always be there
 But I looked away and she ran away from me today
 I'm such a lonely man

 And if it seemed a sin
 To love another man's woman
 I guess I'll keep on sinnin'
 Lovin her till my very last day

 LEAD : C D7 G7 E Am G F D7 G D G

.C            D7  G7            E        Am G F
 But I looked away and she ran away from me today
.           D7     G    Em     Am
 I'm such a lonely man

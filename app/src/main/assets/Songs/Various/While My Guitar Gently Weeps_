;# I prefer to do these chords that way :

;Intro

 Am | Am7/G | Am6/F# | F
 Am | G     | D      | E7

.  Am          Am7/G       Am6/F#            F
 I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
.Am          G          D          E7
 While my guitar gently weeps      
.  Am          Am7/G       Am6/F#       F
 I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
.Am          G          C           E7
 Still my guitar gently weeps       

.A            C#m F#m     C#m
 I don't know why  nobody told you
.Bm                 E7/4   E7
 how to unfold your love   

.A            C#m F#m           C#m
 I don't know how  someone controlled you
.Bm                   E7/4   E7
 They bought and sold you    

 I look at the world and I notice it's turning
 While my guitar gently weeps
 With every mistake we must surely be learning
 Still my guitar gently weeps

;Solo

 Am | Am7/G | Am6/F# | F
 Am | G     | D      | E7
 Am | Am7/G | Am6/F# | F
 Am | G     | C      | E7

 I don't know how you were diverted
 You were perverted too
 I don't know how you were inverted
 No one alerted you.

.  Am          Am7/G       Am6/F#            F
 I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
.Am          G          D          E7
 While my guitar gently weeps      

.Am            Am7/G       Am6/F#            F
..Look at you all                           
.Am          G          D          E7
 Still my guitar gently weeps

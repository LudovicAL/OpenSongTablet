.         D            Em7
 Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh...

.              D                                 Em7
 Everybody was Kung Fu fighting, those cats were fast as lightning
.                 D                                            Em7
 In fact it was a little bit fright'ning, but they fought with expert timing

.          D                    Em7
 There was funky China men from funky Chinatown
.          D                            Em7
 They were cutting bricks up, they were chopping them down
.        D                             Em7
 It's an ancient Chinese art, and everybody knew their part
.       D                                   A7
 For my friend, if you don't flip, then I'm kickin' from the hip

;chorus

 There was funky Billie Jim and little Sammy John
 He said, here comes the big boss, let's get it on
 We took the bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
 A sudden motion made me stiff, now we're into a brandnew trip

;chorus

.         Bm           Em
 Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh...

;chorus

 Kung Fu fighting, had to be fast as lightning...</lyrics>

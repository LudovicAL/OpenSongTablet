 g.......G                (- theremin glissando

.  G7            C/G      G7                    C/G
 (Sweet sweet a honey bee     eat eat a bit of honey)

;verse 1:
.G          C/G                         G          C/G
 Mama, I'm tellin' you as sure as I'm standin' here
.       G          C/G                                G       C/G
 She's my girl and that's the way I'm keepin' it, my mama dear
.    Am                       C
 No good would it do you to stand there and frown at me
.     Am                         C
 The girl's got my heart and my love's comin' down on me
.    Am                         D7                       G
 My life's kinda mellow since I    got a taste of wild honey

;verse 2:
 You know she's got the sweetness of a honey bee
 Wild honey, she got it hard and stung me good, yessirree
 With all the other stud bees buzzin' all around her hive
 She singled me out, single-handed took me alive
 Can you dig it gonna take my life eatin' up her wild honey

;(repeat intro)

;organ solo:
.Em       D        C7       B7

;bridge:
.                Am
 Oh, mama she's sweeter (gettin' sweeter)
 Sweeter (gettin' sweeter)
.                  D7
 Sweeter, sweeter, ah...

;verse 3:
 Wild honey, oh let me tell you how she really got to my soul
 It ain't funny the way she makes me want to sing a little rock 'n roll
 There's nothing quite as sweet as a taste of wild honey
 I break my back workin' just to save me some money
 So I can spend my life with her... sock it to me, wild honey

 try and catch me if you can
.    C        Dm          C  G
 I believe in woman my oh my 

 We all need someone to talk to my oh my
 We all need someone to talk to my oh my
 You need a shoulder to cry on
 call me I'll be standing by
 We all need someone to talk to my oh my

 We all need a lotta lovin' my oh my
 Yeah a whole lotta lovin' my oh my
 I can lend a helping hand
 if you ain't got nothing planned
 We all need a lotta lovin my oh my   (end this line on an E chord)

;Solo over following chords
 |A   D   |A       |C#m F#m |E       |D   A   |Bm  D E |A  Bm7 D|A   F G |

 So let's all swing together my oh my
 We can swing together my oh my
 You've got troubles of your own
 no need to face them all alone
 We can all swing together my oh my

 So let's all pull together my oh my
 Yeah let's all pull together my oh my
 We can ride the stormy weather
 if we all get out and try
 So lets all pull together my oh my</lyrics>

 INTRO:  E/A A     E/A A     D  A  E  Esus E    Esus E    A    D

.      E/A   A     E/A A   D    A     E
 I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
.         Esus E          Esus E      A D
 Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
.    E/A   A      E/A A       D           A             E
 I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town
.     Esus E             Esus E        A   D
 He'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around
.        A  E/A A           D    A   E
 This is your hometown, 		this is your hometown
.        Esus E          Esus E          A     D E/A A
 This is your hometown, 		this is your hometown    

 In `65 tension was running high at my high school
 There was a lot of fights between the black and white
 There was nothing you could do
 Two cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun
 Words were passed in a shotgun blast
 Troubled times had come to my hometown
 My hometown, my hometown, my hometown

.    F#m       E/A A           E/A  A
 Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
.      F#m        E/A  A   E/A  A
 Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
.        D          E/A       A          E/A  A
 They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
.        D       A       E
 Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back to

 Your hometown, your hometown, your hometown, your hometown

 Last night me and Kate we laid in bed talking about getting out
 Packing up our bags maybe heading south
 I'm thirty-five we got a boy of our own now
 Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around
 This is your hometown

;The Cranberries
;From the album:No Need to Argue

;Verse:
.  C       G          Am           F
 All the things you said to me today
.  C       G          Am           F
 Changed my perspective in every way
.  C       G          Am        F
 These things count to mean so much to me
.  C       G          Am       F
 Into my faith you and your baby

;Bridge:
.C           G
 It's out there
.Am          F
 It's out there
.C           G
 It's out there
.   Am                  F
 If you want me I'll be here

;Repeat

;Chorus:
.  C         G             Am       F
 I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
.  C         G             Am       F
 I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
.   C       G          Am                 F
 And there's no other place that I'd lay down my faith
. C       G          Am     F
 dreaming my dreams with you

 Instrumental: Just play the chorus chords with an
 arpeggio style using only 1 downstroke per chord. Then pluck
 the three top strings in this order: 1,2,3,2. On the last chord
 do not pluck.

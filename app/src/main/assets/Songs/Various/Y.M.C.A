 young man, there's no need to feel down.
.        Dm
 I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground.
.        Bb
 I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town
.           C    Bb/C CBb/C C
 there's no need to be unhappy.

 young man, there's a place you can go.
 I said, young man, when you're short on your dough.
 you can stay there, and I'm sure you will find
 many ways to have a good time.

;chorus
[C
.                       F
 it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.
.                       Dm
 it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.
.          Gm     Gm/maj7     Gm7      Gm6
 they have everything for you men to enjoy,
.       Bb/C
 you can hang out with all the boys ...
 it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.
 it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.
 you can get yourself cleaned, you can have a good meal,
 you can do whatever you feel ...

 young man, are you listening to me?
 I said, young man, what do you want to be?
 I said, young man, you can make real your dreams.
 but you got to know this one thing!

 no man does it all by himself.
 I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf,
 and just go there, to the y.m.c.a.
 I'm sure they can help you today.

;chorus

 young man, I was once in your shoes.
 I said, I was down and out with the blues.
 I felt no man cared if I were alive.
 I felt the whole world was so tight ...

 that's when someone came up to me,
 and said, young man, take a walk up the street.
 there's a place there called the y.m.c.a.
 they can start you back on your way.

;chorus, with
 y-m-c-a ... you'll find it at the y-m-c-a.
 young man, young man, there's no need to feel down.
 young man, young man, get yourself off the ground.
 y-m-c-a ... you'll find it at the y-m-c-a.
 young man, young man, there's no need to feel down.
 young man, young man, get yourself off the ground.
 y-m-c-a ... just go to the y-m-c-a.
 young man, young man, are you listening to me?
 young man, young man, what do you wanna be?</lyrics>

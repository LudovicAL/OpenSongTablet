;Intro | E - Esus4 - |

.E            A           E        A
 I like the way sparklin' earrings lay
.E              A         B
   against your skin so brown.
.E               A                     E           A
   And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
.E                A             B
   with a billion stars all around.

;Chorus
[C
.               A              E
 'Cause I got a peaceful, easy feeling
.A                            F#m7   B
 and I know you won't let me down    
.           E    F#m7  A
 'cause I'm al - ready standing
.Bm7sus4     E
 on   the    ground.
;Esus4   E    Esus4   E
[

 I found out a long time ago
 what a woman can do to your soul.
 Ah, but she can't take you any way
 you don't already know how to go.

;Chorus, instrumental verse.

 I got this feeling I may know you
 As a lover and a friend.
 But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear
 tells me I may never see you again.

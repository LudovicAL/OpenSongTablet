.G         Bm          Bb                        Am  D7
 To lead a better life I need my love to be here     
.G Am7 Bm7         C          G     Am7
 Here, making each day of the year  
.Bm7         C           F#m7        B7
 Changing my life with a wave of her hand
.F#m7   B7    Em              Am          Am7   D7
 Nobody can deny that there's something there   

.G  Am7 Bm7        C                G     Am7
 There, running my hand through her hair  
.Bm7        C            F#m7        B7
 Both of us thinking how good it can be
.F#m7       B7           Em          Am        Am7
 Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

;Bridge
.D7F7       Bb         Gm
 I want her everywhere 
.       Cm              D7            Gm
 And if she's beside me I know I need never care
.Cm              D7
 But to love her is to meet her

.G    Am7   Bm7          C          G      Am7
 Ev'rywhere knowing that love is to share  
.Bm7        C            F#m7       B7
 Each one believing that love never dies
.F#m7         B7       Em         Am     Am7    D7
 Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there  

.            G  Am7     Bm7  C
 And will be there, and everywhere
.G     Am7        Bm7  C      G
 here, there, and everywhere</lyrics>

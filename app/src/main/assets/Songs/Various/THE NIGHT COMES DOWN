[Intro]  Am  Em   D  C#  A    Dmaj7

.Dmaj7      D7       G       D         G             C           D
 When I was young it came to me, and I could see the sun breaking
.Dmaj7    D7         G     Bm  Am        D           C#7      A7
 Lucy was high, and so was I,  dazzling, holding the world inside
.Dmaj     D7        G          Gm             D
 Once I believed in everyone, everyone and anyone can see

;Chorus:
.G   A    D     G     D     Bm  F#m     G        F#m       D7
 Oh   the night comes down, and I get afraid, of losing my way
.G   A    D     G     D   F#m G F#m Em7         A7
 Oh the night comes down, Oh           and it's dark again

.Dmaj7

 Once I could laugh with everyone, once I could see the good in me
 The black and the white distinctively, coloring, holding the
 world inside
 Now all the world is grey to me, nobody can see
 (you gotta believe it)

;Chorus, ending:
.Em7        A7
   and it's dark again
.Em7        A7         Em
   and it's dark again     (more ad-libbing, blending into "Good King Rat")</lyrics>

.G                D/F#       Em        D/F#
 Lately I've been running on faith     
.G               D/F#     Em     G7
 What else can a poor boy do     
.       C                               D
 But my world wouldn't be right         
.                G     C     D    D7
 Love comes over me               

.G                D/F#          Em         D/F#
 Lately I've been talking in my sleep      
.G                    D/F#    Em        G7
 And imagining what I have to say       
.       C              D
 Set my world right    
.                 G     C   G       G7
 Love comes back away               

[C
.C           B7
 I've always been
.Em      G7                C       C/B
 want to take each in everyday     
.A
 seems like by now
.                  C                   D      D7
 I find a love who care, care just for me     
[

;like verse 1
 And we go turning on faith
 All of our dreams would come true
 And our world would be right
 Love comes over me with you

;Solo chords as in verse 2

;Chorus
.G         D/F#       Em        D/F#
 And we go running on faith     
.G          D/F#              Em      G7
 All of our dreams would come true    
.        C                             D
 And our world would be right          
.                        F          C
 Love comes over me with you        
;break
.F    G               F      C      F
      Love comes over me for you

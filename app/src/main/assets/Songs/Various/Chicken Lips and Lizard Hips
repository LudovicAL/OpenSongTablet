;Play G during spoken part
 Spoken:  "This is for all you kids out there that hate your mom and pop
 for forcin' you to eat everything that's on you dinner plate every night."

.     G            G                C                G
 Yea, when I was a little kid see I never liked to eat
.    G               G                   D                 D
 And Mama put things on my plate and I'd dump `em on her feet
.    G                G                C             G
 But then one day she made this soup I ate it all in bed
.  G                      G           D                G
 I asked her what she put in it, well this is what she said

.   G                G               C           G
 Oh chicken lips and lizard hips and alligator eyes
.    G               G                D          D
 Yea monkey legs and buzzard eggs and salimander thighs
.      G               G               C              G
 Well, rabbit ears and camel rears and tasty toenail pies
.G                G             D           G
 Stir `em all together and it's Mama's Soup Surprise.

.         G             G              C                  G
 Well now I went in the bathroom and I stood beside the sink
.           G                 G           D                 D
 I said I'm feeling slightly ill and I'd think I'd like a drink
.G                G                    C             G
 Mama said I have just the thing, I'll get it in a wink
.     G               G           D           G
 It's full of lots of protein and vitamins, I think

.       G                G               C           G
 It was chicken lips and lizard hips and alligator eyes
.    G               G                D          D
 Yea monkey legs and buzzard eggs and salimander thighs
.G               G               C              G
 Rabbit ears and camel rears and tasty toenail pies
.G                G             D           G
 Stir `em all together and it's Mama's Soup Surprise.</lyrics>

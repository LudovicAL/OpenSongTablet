.     F              Dm
 1.   I'd like to be under the sea
.      Bb        F              C7
 In an Octopus's Garden in the shade.
.F               Dm
 He'd let us in, knows where we've been,
.       Bb        F              C7
 In his Octopus's Garden in the shade.

.Dm
 I'd ask my friends to come and see
.Bb           C
 An Octopus's Garden with me.
.F              Dm
 I'd like to be under the sea
.      Bb        C7             F
 In an Octopus's Garden in the shade.

 2.   We would be warm below the storm
 In our little hideaway beneath the waves.
 Resting our head on the sea bed
 In an Octopus's Garden near a cave.

 We would sing and dance around
 Because we know we can't be found.
 I'd like to be under the sea
 In an Octopus's Garden in the shade.

 3.   We would shout and swim about
 The coral that lies beneath the waves.
 Oh, what joy for every girl and boy
 Knowing they're happy and they're safe.

 We would be so happy, you and me.
 No one there to tell us what to do.
 I'd like to be under the sea
 In an Octopus's Garden with you.

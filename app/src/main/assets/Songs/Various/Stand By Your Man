.A                           E
 Sometimes it's hard being a woman
.Bm              E7               A
 Giving all your love to just one man
.D
 You'll have bad times
.A
 And He'll have good times
.Bm                               E
 Doing things that you don't understand

.A                           E
 But if you love him, you'll forgive him
.Bm               E7        A
 Even though he's hard to understand
.D
 And if you love him
.A               D
 Oh, Be proud of him
.A             E7             A  D A E
 'Cause after all he's just a man    

.A             C#
 Stand by your man
.D                    C#m   Bm
 Give him two arms to cling to
.A             F#7
 And something warm to come to
.B               E7
 When nights are cold and lonely

.A             C#
 Stand by your man
.D                      C#m  Bm
 And tell the world you love him
.A           E7               C#7  F#
 Keep giving all the love you can  
.D     E       A   D A E7
 Stand by your man     

.A             C#
 Stand by your man
.D                      C#m  Bm
 And show the world you love him
.A           E            E7  C#7  F#
 Keep giving all the love you can  
.D     E       A    D A E  A
 Stand by your man

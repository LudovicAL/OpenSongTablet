.C          E7         Am         C          F       G         F         G
                                                                         

.            C         E7      Am   C             F                G   F    G
 Bell bottom blues you made me cry, I don't wanna lose this feeling         
.               C        E7       Am   C           F           G
 And if I could choose a place to die, it would be in your arms

;Chorus
.A                   Amaj7            F#m         D   E
 Do you wanna see me crawl across the floor to you    
.A                   Amaj7              F#m        D      E
 Do you wanna see me beg you to take me back, I'll gladly do it because
.A             Amaj7 A7   D                E
 I don't wanna fade away, give me one more day please
.A             Amaj7 A7   D               E
 I don't wanna fade away, in your heart I long to stay

.         C         E7       Am     C                F            G   F    G
 It's all wrong but it's all right, the way that you treat me baby         
.           C             E7       Am     C                F            G
 Once I was strong, but I lost the fight, you won't find a better loser 

;Chorus
;Lead solo
;Chorus

.            C           E7      Am   C                  F         G    F   G
 Bell bottom blues don't say goodbye, we're surely gonna meet again         
.          C        E7    Am    C                    F           G
 And if we do don't be suprised if you find me with another lover

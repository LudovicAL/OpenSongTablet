[Intro] A

.A            D      A         G         A
 Well it was nearly summer, sat on your roof
.         D        A              G
 Yeah we smoked cigarettes and we stared at the moon
.       D      A            G           D
 And I showed you stars you never could see
.                       D                  C
 Babe, it couldn�t have been that easy to forget about me

.      D        A              G         A
 Baby time meant nothin� anything seemed real
.                D        A             G
 Yeah you could kiss like fire and you made me feel
.            D   A           G         D
 Like every word you said was meant to be
.                       D          A       C
 Babe, it couldn�t have been that easy to forget about me

;Chorus
.                 D  A G
 Baby even the losers
.     D          A  G
 Get lucky sometimes
.           D   A G
 Even the losers
.         G
 Keep a little bit of pride
.          A
 They get lucky sometimes

;(Solo  repeat chords as in verses 1&amp;2)

;Bridge
.A         Asus4
 Two cars parked on the overpass
.A              Asus4
 Rocks hit the water like broken glass
.A           Asus4
 Should have known right then it was too good to last
.A     Asus4               G               G
 It�s such a drag when you live in the past

;Intro:  D   G

.D                  G
 I,       I will be king
.        D             G
 And you, you will be queen
.       C                       D
 Though nothing will drive them away
.       C                      D
 We can beat them just for one day
.          C         G                D
 We can be Heroes        just for one day

.D                   G
 And you, you can be mean
.     D                  G
 And I, I'll drink all the time
.             D                     G
 'Cause we're lovers and that is a fact
.          D                    G
 Yes we're lovers and that is that
.       C                      D
 Though nothing will keep us together
.               C                 D
 We could steal time just for one day
.          C     G             D
 We can be Heroes for ever and ever
 What do you say?

.D                  G
 I, I wish you could swim
.         D                           G
 Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
.       C                        D
 Though nothing will keep us together
.       C                      D
 We can beat them for ever and ever
.             C     G             D
 Oh we can be Heroes just for one day

;REPEAT 1st verse (sing an octave higher, sound desperate)

.D           G
 I, I can remember
.D              G
 Standing by the wall
.         D                  G
 And the guards shot above our heads
.        D                             G
 And we kissed as though nothing could fall
.       C                      D
 And the Seine was on the other side
.          C                       D
 Oh we can beat them forever and ever
.               C      G                D
 Then we can be Heroes just for one day</lyrics>

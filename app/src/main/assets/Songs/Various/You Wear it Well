.D     G
 I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
.       A                           D
 but to settle down and write you a line
.       G
 I been meaning to phone ya, but from Minnesota
.A                           D
 Hell, it's been a very long time

.            A
 You wear it well
.  Em         D/F#          G          A
 A little old fashioned but that's all right

.D    G
 I suppose you're thinking Aunt Betty's sinking
.      A                          D
 oh he wouldn't get in touch with me
.    G
 For I ain't begging or losing my head
.  A                   D
 I sure do want you to know

.                 A
 That you wear it well
.Em            D/F#      G       A
 There ain't a lady in a land so fine oh my

.D
 Remember those
.G
 basement parties, your brothers karate
.A                     D
 All day rock and roll shows
.    G
 the homesick blues and the radical views
.A                      D
 haven't left a mark on you

.            A
 You wear it well
.  Em                 D/F#     G       A
 A little late on the time but I don't mind

.               G                          A
 But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
.      G                    A
 but I blew it without even trying
.        G
 Now I'm eating my heart out
.A                      D
 trying to get a letter through

.Em                D/F#              G        A
 Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on 

.          D
 I want to write about the
.G
 birthday gown that I bought in town
.   A                             D
 as you sat down and cried on the stairs
 You knew it didn't
.G
 cost the earth, but for what it's worth
.            A                  D
 you made me feel like a millionaire

.                A
 and you wear it well
.Em      D/F#       G          A
 Madame Onassis got nothing on you

.D       G
 Well my  coffee's cold, and I'm gettin told
.       A                 D
 that I gotta get back to work
.            G
 So when the sun goes low and you're home alone
.A                           D
  think of me and try not to laugh

.              A
 and I wear it well
.Em      D/F#        G       A
 I don't mind if you call collect

.      D        G                          A
 But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
.      G                    A
 but I blew it without even trying
.        G
 Now I'm eating my heart out
.A                     D
 trying to get back to you

.Em                D/F#         G         A
 Since that's been said, what's left to address?</lyrics>

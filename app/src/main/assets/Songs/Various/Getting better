.Fmaj7(V)

.C                           F/G
 It's getting better all the time
.  G           C/G       G             C/G
 I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
.    G             C/G               G            C/G
 The teachers that taught me weren't cool  (No, I can't complain)
.       G          C/G   G          C/G
 You're holding me down, turning me around
.G          C/G          G    C/G G
 Filling me up with your rules

;Chorus:
.     C                         F
 I've got to admit it's getting better
.         Em             F
 A little better all the time
.  C                          F
 I have to admit it's getting better
.             Em               F       Fmaj7G
 It's getting better since you've been mine 

.C    G        C/G         G  C/G
 Me used to be angry young man
.     G       C/G         G   C/G
 Me hiding me head in the sand
.    G           C/G    G       C/G
 You gave me the word I finally heard
.    G         C/G         G
 I'm doing the best that I can ...

;Chorus

;Bridge:
.F C/E   F  C/E  F  C/E F   C/E C
 Getting so much better all the time
.C                           F     Em              Fmaj7
 It's getting better all the time, better, better, better
.C                           F     Em              Fmaj7 G
 It's getting better all the time, better, better, better

.  G
 I used to be cruel to my woman
.                                                       G    F C G
 I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
 Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
 And I'm doing the best that I can

;Chorus #2:
 I admit it's getting better
 A little better all the time (can't get no worse)
 Yes, I admit it's getting better
 It's getting better since you've been mine ...

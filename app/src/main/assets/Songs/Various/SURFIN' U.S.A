;Intro: git

.                    B7                    E
 If ev'rybody had an ocean, across the U.S.A.
.                    B7                    E
 Then ev'rybody'd be surfin' like California
.                             A                         E
 You'd see them wearin' their baggies, huarachi sandals too
.                    B7              E
 A bushy bushy blond hairdo, surfin' U.S.A.

 You'll catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar, Ventura County Line
 Santa Cruz and Tressels, Australia's Narabine
 All over Manhattan and down Doheny Way
 Ev'rybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A.

 Well all be plannin' out a route, we're gonna take real soon
 We're waxin' down out surfboards, we can't wait for June
 We'll all be gone for the summer, we're on safari to stay
 Tell the teacher we're surfin', surfin' U.S.A.

 At Haggarty's and Swami's, Pacific Palisades
 San Onofree and Sunset, Redondo Beach, L. A.
 All over La Jolla, at Waiamea Bay
 Ev'rybody's gone surfin', surfin' U.S.A.

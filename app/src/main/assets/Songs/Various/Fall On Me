.Dm                Am
 There's a problem feathers iron
.Dm                Am
 Bargain buildings weights and pullies
.Dm               Am                Dm                   Am
 Feathers hit the ground before the weight can leave the air
.Dm      G       C        Am      Dm               G7
 Buy the sky and sell the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky

.        C       Dm          F        G
 Don't   Fall         On     Me       
 (What is it up in the air for?)
.        C       Dm          F        G
 Don't   Fall         On     Me       
 (If it's there for)
.        C       Dm          F        G     F
 Don't   Fall         On     Me             
 ((Assume that it's over me)

.Dm                   Am
 There's the progress we have found
.  Dm           Am
 A way to talk around the problem
.Dm               Am              Dm          Am
 Building towered foresight isn't anything at all
.Dm      G       C        Am      Dm                G7
 Buy the sky and sell the sky and bleed the sky and tell the sky

;Chorus

.Am           F
 Well I would keep it above
.Am          G                         Am
 But then it wouldn't be sky anymore   
.        F                            Dm                 G
 So if I send it to you you've got to promise to keep it home
.Dm      G       C        Am      Dm        G       C      Am
 Buy the sky and sell the sky and lift your arms up to the sky
.    Dm              G
 and ask the sky and ask the sky

;Chorus 3x, end on Am</lyrics>

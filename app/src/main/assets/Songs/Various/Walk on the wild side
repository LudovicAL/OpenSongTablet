.C                        F
 Holly came from Miami, Fla
.C                               F
 Hitchhiked her way across the USA.
.C                    D
 Plucked her eyebrows on the way
.F                          D
 Shaved her leg and then he  was she - she said:

.    C                              F
 Hey  Babe, take a walk on the wild  side,
.     C                                  F
 Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild  side.

.C                          F
 Candy came from out on the island,
.C                                     F
 In the backroom she was everybodys darling,
.    C              D
 But she never lost  her head
.F                   D
 Even when she was given head - she said

.    C                              F
 Hey  Babe, take a walk on the wild  side,
.     C                                  F
 Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild  side.
.                       C
 And the coloured girls go, doo dodoo (7x on F C)

.C                              F
 Little Joe never once gave it away,
.C                        F
 Ev'rybody had to pay and pay.
.    C                 D
 A hustle here and a hustle there
.F                   D
 New York city is no  place where they said:

.    C                              F
 Hey  Babe, take a walk on the wild  side,
.     C                                  F
 Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild  side.

.C                                 F
 Sugar plum fairy came and hit the streets
.C                                    D
 Looking for soul food and a place to eat
.C           D                  F
 Went to the Apollo, you should  have seen him go go go - they said:

.    C                               F
 Hey  Sugar, take a walk on the wild  side,
.     C                                  F
 Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild  side.

.C                        F
 Jackie is just speeding away,
.C                                F
 Thought she was James Dean for a day
.     C               D          F                   D
 Then  I guess she had to crash, Valium would have helped that bash - she said:

.    C                               F
 Hey  Sugar, take a walk on the wild  side,
.     C                                  F
 Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild  side.
.                       C
 And the coloured girls go, doo dodoo (7x on F C)</lyrics>

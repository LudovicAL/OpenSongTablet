.    A  G#7      D               E7
 I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
.    A  F#m7      D              E7
 I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
.  A               E+         F#m          Dm
 I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink, no, no, no

.    A  G#7      D               E7
 I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
.    A  F#m7      D              E7
 I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
.  A               E+             F#m                 Dm
 I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

 You say I'm putting you on
.A
 But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
.           E7
 You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
.              E7
 You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
.             D                                                  A
 You know I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

.    A  G#7        D            E7
 I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
.  A          F#m7           D                E7
 Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
.    A                E+              F#m           Dm
 And curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid get

;intro (bass)
.F#m     G#m/F#       F#m7    G#m/F#
 f# c# e f# e c# b c# f# c# e f# e c# b c#

.F#m     G#m/F#      F#m7                G#m/F#
 She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
.F#m          G#m/F#        F#m7
 I said don`t mind but what do you mean,
.G#m/F#   Bm7
 I am the one       (bass: b f# a b . f# e f# (2x))
.                                   F#m     G#m/F#      F#m7
 Who will dance on the floor in the round?              
.         G#m/F#   Bm7
 She said I am the one
.                                   F#m     G#m/F#      F#m7
 Who will dance on the floor in the round?              
.G#m/F#

 She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene.
 Then ev`ry head turned with eyes that dreamed
 Of being the one,
 Who will dance on the floor in the round

.D                         F#m
 People always told me, be careful what you do.
.          D                                     F#m
 And don`t go around breaking young girls' hearts.
.    D                         F#m
 And mother always told me, be careful who you love,
.       D                               C#7
 And be careful what you do, `cause the lie becomes the truth, hey

[C]
.F#m    G#m/F#  F#m7   G#m/F#
 Billie Jean is not my lover,
.F#m          G#m/F#   F#m7        G#m/F#   Bm7
 She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
.                      F#m   G#m/F#      F#m7
 But the kid is not my son               
.         G#m/F#   Bm7
 She says I am the one,
.                      F#m   G#m/F#      F#m7         G#m/F#
 But the kid is not my son

 For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
 But who can stand when she`s in demand,
 Her scemes and plans
 `Cause we danced on the floor in the round.
 So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice

 She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me,
 Then showed a photo. My baby cried.
 His eyes were like mine.
 Can we dance on the floor in the round?

.D                         F#m
 People always told me, be careful what you do.
.          D                                     F#m
 And don`t go around breaking young girls' hearts.
.        D                                  F#m
 But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume.
.     D                           C#7
 This happened much too soon. She called me to her room, hey

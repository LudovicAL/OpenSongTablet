.Am              E                                        Am
 In an anonymous rendez-vous where the forbidden lovers repair
.        C                         G
 They're burning down another damn candle
.        E                      Fmaj7
 they're melting the tables and chairs
.  Am                           E
 Beneath them applause from the balcony
.                                  Am
 whenever they accomplished making love
.C                                   G
 Other times they thought they heard laughter
.E                       Fmaj7
 coming from the balcony above

.    G                         D
 She lies to his right and she carelessly resites
.Em                       D
 All of her brand new appetites
.          G                          D
 She seems brittle and small it don't sound like her at all
.Em                         E
 Since she came back to him After the fall

 She said You never visited the countryside
 So I've made you a country to order
 She put up a little tent in the bedroom
 Crickets played on a tape recorder
 The ceiling was festooned with phosphorous stars
 She noticed his skin turning cold
 Burning all his clothes on the bonfire
 Relax she whispered and tightened the blindfold

 She lies to his right.....

 You've changed but not for the better, babe
 I'd tell you why but what's the use
 'Cause it's the same kind of pity
 a drunkard gives as his excuse
 You were sharp and ideal as a bobby pin
 Now your eyes are deserted and quiet
 We both look like those poor shattered mannequins
 Thrown through the window in the riot

 She lies in his arms and without any qualms
 Revels in shallow delights
 She seems brittle and small it don't look like her at all
 Since she came back to him After the fall</lyrics>

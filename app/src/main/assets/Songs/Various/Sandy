[V1]
.C         F                                 C
 Sandy the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight
.Am                                                   Gsus
 Forcin' a light into all those stoned-out faces left stranded on this warm July
.        C                           F                     C
 Down in town the circuit's full wit switchblade lovers so fast so shiny so sharp
.       Am                                      Gsus
 As the wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark
.        F                          G                           C
 And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like Latin lovers on
.    Am
 the shore

[C]
.        Gsus                    G    F/G G7
 Chasin' all them silly New York girls  
.F  C  F          C           F/G  G  G7   F    C          F        C         F
 Sandy the aurora is risin' behind us, the pier lights our carnival life forever
.F       C           F C   G                              Dm7 G7C
 Love me tonight for I may never see you again, hey Sandy girl  

[V2]
 Now the greasers they tramp the streets or get busted for trying to sleep on the beach all night
 Them boys in their spiked high heels ah Sandy their skins are so white
 And me I just got tired of hangin' in them dusty arcades bangin' them pleasure machines
 Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they promise to unsnap their jeans
 And you know that tilt-a-whirl down on the south beach drag
 I got on it last night and my shirt got caught
 And that Joey kept me spinnin' I didn't think I'd ever get off

 Oh Sandy the aurora is risin' behind us
 The pier lights our carnival life on the water
 Runnin' down the beach at night with my boss's daughter
 Well he ain't my boss no more Sandy

 Sandy the angels have lost their desire for us
 I spoke to `em just last night and they said they won't set themselves on fire
 for us anymore
 Every summer when the weather gets hot they ride that road down from heaven on
 their Harleys they come and they go
 And you can see `em dressed like stars in all the cheap little seashore bars
 parked making love with their babies out on the Kokomo
 Well the cops finally busted Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better than they
 do
 This boardwalk life for me is through
 You know you ought to quit this scene too

 Sandy the aurora's rising behind us, the pier lights our carnival life forever
 Oh love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever

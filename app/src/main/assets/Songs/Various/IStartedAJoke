 {:I started a joke}
;The Bee Gees

.G            Bm   C                    D            G   Bm C
 I started a joke    which started the whole world crying
.    D          G Bm C           D          G
 But I didn't see     that the joke was on me
.G             Bm  C                     D           G      Bm C
 I started to cry     which started the whole world laughing
.       D         G  Bm C           D         G
 Oh, if I'd only seen    that the joke was on me

;Chorus:
.Em                Bm               C            G
 I looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes
.    Bm             Em             Am                    D
 And I fell out of bed hurting my head from things that I said

.G                Bm  C                    D           G   Bm C
 Till I finally died   which started the whole world living
.       D          G  Bm C          D           G
 Oh, if I'd only seen     that the joke was on me
.Bm   C             D          G  BmC D
 Oh    no that the joke was on me   
.G Bm C D G

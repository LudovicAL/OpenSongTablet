.F#
 Staring out my window
.Eb
 Watching the cars go rolling by
.B                                       C#
 My friends are gone, I've got nothing to do
 So I sit here patiently
 Watching the clock tick so slowly
 Gotta get away or my brain will explode

.B                    F#             C#
 Give me something to do to kill some time
 Take me to that place that I call home
 Take away the strains of being lonely
 Take me to the tracks of Christie Road

 See the hills from afar
 Standing on my beat up car
 The sun went down and the night fills the sky
 Now I feel like me once again
 As the train comes rolling in
 Smoked my boredom gone, slapped my brains up so high

.F# E B E
        

.F#  Bb      E
 Mother stay out of my way
 Of that place we go
 We'll always seem to find our way
 To Christie Road

.           B         E    F#
 If there's one thing that need
 That makes me feel complete
 So I go to Christie Road
.     E
 It's home
.     B
 It's home . . .

.F# E B E</lyrics>

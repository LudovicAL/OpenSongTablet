.D                    Bm     C#m                     Gdim   F#7
 I've nothing much to offer, there's nothing much to take   
.G                 D       C                  Bm   Em        A
 I'm an absolute beginner, but I'm absolutely sane           

.D                  Bm      C#m                Gdim      F#7
 As long as we're together, the rest may go to hell      
.G            D         C                    Bm
 I absolutely love you, but we're absolute beginners
.G                    D     F#                  A
 With eyes completely open, but nervous all the same

[C]
.Em   A   D                        G
 If   our love song could fly over mountain
.                   Bm                    F#
 Could laugh at the ocean, just like the films
.Em      A  D                      G
 There's no reason to feel all the hard times
.                Bm                          A
 To lay down the hard lines, it's absolutely true
[]

.D                  Bm      C#m              Gdim       F#7
 Nothing much could happen, nothing we can't shake      
.G                       D        C                    Bm    Em
 Though we're absolute beginners, with nothing much at stake 
.A

.D                       Bm       C#m                    Gdim
 As long as you're still smiling, there's nothing more I need
.F#7

.G            D         C                    Bm
 I absolutely love you, but we're absolute beginners
.G                 D          F#                  A
 But if my love is your love, we're certain to succeed

.F                  C              Bb
   Lisa says on a night like this, 
.                         C     F
 be so nice if you'd give me a kiss.
.F                              C           Bb
   And Lisa says for just one little smile, 
.                             C      F
 I'll sit next to you for a little while.

   Lisa says you must be some kind of fool,
.                            C    F
 The way you treat everybody so cruel.
.                           C                  Bb
 And Lisa says you must be a funny kind of guy,
.                              C       F
 The way you're always staring at the sky.

 If you're lookin for a   good-time Charlie,

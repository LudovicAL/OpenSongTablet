;Intro

.D
 She's got a smile that it seems to me
.  Cadd9
 Reminds me of childhood memories
.      G                                          D
 Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky
.D
 Now and then when I see her face
.    Cadd9
 she takes me away to that special place
.         G                                         D
 and if I stay too long I'd probably break down and cry

.Cadd9    G                 D
 Oh oh oh oh sweet child of mine
.Cadd9    G                D
 Oh oh oh oh sweet love of mine

.D
 She's got eyes of the bluest sky
.   Cadd9
 as if they thought of rain
.  G                                D
 I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
.    D
 Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
.      Cadd9
 where as a child I'd hide
.    G                                    D
 and pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

.Cadd9    G                 D
 Oh oh oh oh sweet child of mine
.Cadd9    G                D
 Oh oh oh oh sweet love of mine

.Em   C    B7   Am   Em   C    B7   Am   Em   C    B7   Am   Em   C    B7   Am

 Where do we go
 Sweet child of mine

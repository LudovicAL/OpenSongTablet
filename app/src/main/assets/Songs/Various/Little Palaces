 Introduction:    Em  D  G   (3 1 4)
 C   D  G   (3 1 4)
 C   D  G   (3 1 4)
 D   G  D  Em  (2 1 1 strum)

.Em      D    G            C               D  G              C      D            G
 In Chocolate Town all the trains are painted brown, and the silver paper of the wrapper.
.          Em         D  G           C           D G
 There's a dapper little man, and he wears a wax mustache
.        C              D     G             C             D     G
 That he twists with nicotine fingers as he drops his cigarette ash.
.    D                                   G
 And someone comes and sweeps it up, and then he doffs his cap
.              D                                     G
 And there's a rat in someone's bedroom, and they're shutting someone's trap.
.            Em              D
 And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces.

.        Em               D   G                 C         D   G
 And the doors swing back and forward, from the past into the present
.        C          D G                 C       D      G
 And the bedside crucifixion turns from wood to phosphorescent.
.            D                                G
 And they're moving problem families from the South up to the North,
.D                              G
 Mother's crying over some soft soap opera divorce,
.        C                             F               D
 And you say you didn't do it, but you know you did of course,
.            Em              D
 And they'll soon be pulling down the little palaces.

.          Em          D G                     C            D   G
 It's like shouting in a matchbox, filled with plasterboard and hope,
.       C           D      G              C            D   G
 Like a picture of  Prince William in the arms of John the Pope.
.          Em            D G             C       D     G
 There's a world of good intentions, and pity in their eyes,
. A      C           D  G            C            D G
 The sedated homes of England, are theirs to vandalize.

.       D                           G
 So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,
.        D                             G
 And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.
.         Em                 D
 And they feel like knocking down the little palaces.

.           Em         D    G              C        D         G
 You're the twinkle in your daddy's eye, a name you spray and scribble,
.             C              D     G             C              D   G
 You made the girls all turn their heads, and in turn they made you miserable.
.   Em          D G              C          D   G
 To be the heir apparent, to the kingdom of the invisible.
.       D                           G
 So you knock the kids about a bit, because they've got your name,
.        D                             G
 And you knock the kids about a bit, until they feel the same.
.         Em                 D
 And they feel like knocking down
.          C                  G
 yeah they feel like knocking down,
.        Em                 D
 Oh they feel like knocking down the little palaces.

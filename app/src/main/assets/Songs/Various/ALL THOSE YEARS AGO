.D                          Em                              Eo7
 I'm shouting all about love, while they treated you like a dog
.      D           F#m7        Em7         Gm6    D         B7   Em7
 When you were the one who had made it so clear, all those years ago
.D                                Em                             Eo7
 I'm talking all about how to give, they don't act with much honesty
.     D            F#m7        Em7           Gm6   D       B7     Em7
 But you point the way to the truth when you say, all you need is love

;CHORUS #1:
. A           D       Em     A                    D
 Living with good and bad, I always looked up to you
. A              D       Em       A7
 Now we're left cold and sad, by someone the devil's best friend
.A7+5                  D
 Someone who offended all

.                            Em                              Eo7
 We're living in a bad dream, they've forgotten all about mankind
.     D           F#m7            Em7       Gm6    D         B7   Em7
 And you were the one they backed up to the wall, all those years ago
. D           F#m7     Em7        Gm6   D         B7   Em7D
 You were the one who imagined it all, all those years ago

 all those years ago
 (solo over) D Dm D Dm D Em Eo7 D F#m7 Em7 Gm6  D          B7   Em7
 all those years ago
 D    Em Eo7 D f#m7 Em7 Gm6  D          B7   Em7

;CHORUS #2:
. A           D       Em       A                    D
 Deep in the darkest night, I send out a prayer to you
. A           D       Em               A7
 Now in the world of light, where the spirit free of lies
.A7+5                     D
 And all else that we despised

.                                Em                          Eo7
 They've forgotten all about God, he's the only reason we exist
.     D           F#m7           Em7         Gm6    D         B7   Em7
 Yet you were the one that they said was so weird, all those years ago
. D          F#m7           Em7      Gm6    D         B7   Em7
 You said it all though not many had ears, all those years ago
. D         F#m7         Em7            Gm6    D         B7   Em7  A  D
 You had control of our smiles and our tears, all those years ago-----

.D            Em     Eo7    D  F#m7  Em7  Gm6  D         B7   Em7
                                              all those years 
 ago

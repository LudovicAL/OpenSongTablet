.G7G7/4 G7 G7/4
       
.G7                     G7/4
 Reflections in my mind  thoughts I can't define
.G7                          F         C/E
 My heart is racing and the night goes on
.G7                        G7/4
 I can almost hear a laugh  coming from your fotograph
.G7                              F         C/E
 Funny, how a look can share a thousand meanings
.G7                 G7/4
 Well intended lies contemplating alibis
.G7                        F       C/E
 Is it really you or is it me I'm blaming?
.G7                G7/4
 A distance memory flashes over me
.G7                                 C/E   F G/B  C F/A Bb
 Even though you're gone I feel you deep inside      
.  C                      Bb             F/A           C
 Oooh, dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

;chorus

.F Bb    Dm7         C
 I can't stop loving you
.F            Bb         Dm7         C
 Time passes quickly and chances are few
.F Bb    Dm7            C             Bb9
 I won't stop till I'm through loving you, girl.

.G7                                G7/4
 There's a window in a heart, I've tried to look through from the start
.G7                                    F       C/E
 You're never really sure what someone else is thinking
.G7                             G7/4
 Someone's broken something new, another altered point of wiew
.G7                        F           C/E
 Just a certain someone's conscience playing
.G7                    G7/4
 I held it in my hand, I did not understand
.G7                                F        C/E
 What lives inside the wind that cries her name
.G7                                 G7/4
 Trying to catch a shooting star what seems so close can't be that far
.G7                       C/E F   G/B  C  F/A Bb
 Living in a dream that's never  ending       
.    C                    Bb              F/A          C
 Oooh, dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

.Bb  C                    Bb              F/A           C
 Oo-oh, dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

;chorus (repeat 'till fade)

.       G                          C
 Saw a sign on the highway I was driving along
.     G                      D
 Way home on a hill top is where I belong
.          G                         C
 I took a look at the home where my head used to be
.          G                       D
 And I'll sing you a song that descended on me
.     G            C            G       D        G
 The way I live determines the way my people survive
.         G            C            G       D        C  C/B Am7 G C G
 Yes the way I live determines the way my people survive

.      G                      C
 So I went to the country to look up a friend
.        G                           D
 Cos I heard that the house and the barn had a blend
.          G                          C
 I took a look at the hole where the bird used to be
.          G                          D
 And I'll sing him a song because he sang one for me
.     G            C            G       D        G
 The way I live determines the way my people survive
.         G            C            G       D        C  C/B Am7 G C G
 Yes the way I live determines the way my people survive

.          C           D           Bm
 And the names of the cowboys will all blow away
.          C            D          Bm
 Like the dust off the desert on a hot windy day
.            C          D          Bm       C
 I've tried so hard to tell you in so many ways
.           C            Am7            D                         G
 That I'm scared of the heartache and scenes with the cowboy of dreams

.G     C     G     D     G     C     G     D
                                           

.          C           D           Bm
 And the names of the cowboys will all blow away
.          C            D          Bm
 Like the dust off the desert on a hot windy day
.            C          D          Bm       C
 I've tried so hard to tell you in so many ways

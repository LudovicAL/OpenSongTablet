.Bm                 A                    E
 World was on fire, no one could save me but you
.Bm                        A                 E
 What strange world desire will make foolish people do
.Bm                   A                      E
 I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
.Bm                   A                      E
 I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

[C
.Bm  A                 E
 Now I want to fall in love
.Bm  A                 E
 Now I want to fall in love
.     Bm      A         E
 With you

 What a wicked game to play to make me feel this way
 What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you
 What a wicked thing to say you never felt that way
 What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you

;chorus

 World was on fire, no one could save me but you
 What strange world desire will make foolish people do
 I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
 I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

;chorus

 Nobody loves no one</lyrics>

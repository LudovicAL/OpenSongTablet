.     F                        C
 wine beer and spirits all the time
.              G               F            C
 though I have you still she's always on my mind
.               G                 C
 the rain falls dowm  i'm soaking through
.       G                            C
 i'm an old man inside a young man's suit
.             Am               F
 my crocodile shoes are crying too
.        G             F               C
 for the know how much love I have for you

.          Am     C         G
 crocodile shoes  crocodile shoes

.          Am     C         G     FGAm C
 crocodile shoes  crocodile shoes    

.     F                        C
 wine beer and spirits take me down
.               F                           G      Bm
 the lights are low and there's no one else around 
.    C                                           F
 the waitress sure looks pretty and that's a bad sign
.           G                F            C
 I smile at her still you're always on my mind

.             G               C
 i've lost so much in a short time
.            G                  C
 don't se my kids how i miss my wife
.          Am                    F
 I let the world slip through my hands
.            G              F              C
 and now i'm talking to the only friends i have

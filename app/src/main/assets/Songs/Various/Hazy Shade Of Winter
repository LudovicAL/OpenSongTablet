;intro
.Dm     C      Bb     A7
                      

.Dm                             C
 Time, time, time, see what's become of me
.       Bb                         Am
 While I looked around for my possibilities
.         C
 I was so hard to please
.            Dm                C
 But look around, leaves are brown
.          Bb      A7            Dm
 And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

.                   C
 Hear the salvation army band
.Bb
 Down by the riverside, it's bound to be a better ride
 Than what you've got planned
 Carry your cup in your hand
 And look around, leaves are brown now
 And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

 Hang on to your hopes, my friend
 That's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away
 Simply pretend
 That you can build them again
 Look around, the grass is high
 The fields are ripe, it's the springtime of my life

.Bb                            F     Fmaj7
 Ahhh, seasons change with the scenery
.                  C9
 Weaving time in a tapestry
.                     Dm A7   Dm
 Won't you stop and remember me
.C
   At any convenient time
.Bb
 Funny how my memory slips while looking over manuscripts
 Of unpublished rhyme
 Drinking my vodka and lime
 But look around, leaves are brown now
 And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

 Look around, leaves are brown
 There's a patch of snow on the ground...</lyrics>

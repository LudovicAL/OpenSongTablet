 I've just been to see my best friend
.G                Dm7
 he's got another girl
.G                         Dm7
 says she's just about the best thing

 in the whole damn world

 Happy loving couples make it look so easy

 Happy loving couples make always talk so kind

 People say I'm too damn fussy
.G                Dm7
 when it comes to girls
.G                   Dm7
 happy couples say I must live
.G           Dm7
 in a lonely world

.      C                   G
 Wanna be, wanna really be what my friends pretend to be
.C                    Bm
 be it in my own good time
.      C                       G                    D
 being kind to myself till I become one of two of a kind

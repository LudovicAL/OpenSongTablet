.       AC#m D A
[Intro]    

.C#m          D              A
 You can take all the tea in China
.C#m                   D       E
 Put it in a big brown bag for me.
.A          C#m           D        A
 Sail right round all the seven oceans,
.A          C#m            D              A
 Drop it straight into the deep blue sea. 

;Chorus:
.A    C#m       D         A
 She's as sweet as tupelo honey,
.A        C#m          D            E
 She's an angel of the first degree.
.A    C#m       D         A
 She's as sweet as tupelo honey,
.A         C#m         D        A
 Just like honey baby, from the bee.

 You can't stop us on the road to freedom,
 You can't keep us `cause our eyes can see.
 Men with insight, men in granite,
 Knights in armor bent on chivalry.

;Chorus

 You can't stop us on the road to freedom,
 You can't stop us `cause our eyes can see.
 Men with insight, men in granite,
 Knights in armor intent on chivalry.</lyrics>

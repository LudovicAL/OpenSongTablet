;intro tab:

.Bm              D     Bm           D
  In the dark of night, those small hours,
.  Em                  F#         Bm
 Uncertain and anxious, I need to call you

;repeat intro once

.Bm              D         Bm            D
  Room's full of strangers, some call me friend
.      Em               F#       Bm
 But I wish you were so close to me
.               D     Bm           D
 In the dark of night, those small hours
.  Em              F#m      Bm
 I drift away when I'm with you
.                     D       G
 In the dark of night, (by my side)
.                     D       G
 In the dark of night, (by my side)
.Bm               G               A
  I wish you were, I wish you were

.Bm              D     Bm             D
  Here comes the clown, his face is a wall
.   Em         F#     Bm
 No window, no air at all
.               D     Bm                D
 In the dark of night, these faces they haunt me
.      Em               F#       Bm
 But I wish you were so close to me
.A                     D       G
  In the dark of night, (by my side)
.                     D       G
 In the dark of night, (by my side)
.Bm               G               A
  I wish you were, I wish you were

.                     D       G
 In the dark of night, (by my side)
.                     D       G
 In the dark of night, (by my side)
.Bm               G               A
  I wish you were, I wish you were

.Bm              D     Bm                D
  In the dark of night, those faces they haunt me
.      Em               F#         Bm
 But I wish you were so close to me
.      Em            F#    Bm
 Yes I wish you were by my side</lyrics>

;Bill Withers

;Basically Am and Em, picking the bass note then a strum for each:
;pick, Am, pick, Em, pick 6th string with pinky on third fret, repeat.
;I don't have this written in below. The chords listed are transitions
;from this pattern.

;Intro: Repeat the above pattern a couple of times, then during
;verses, starting with the first Am listed below
.                             Am   Em
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
.                    Am  Em
 Only darkness every day 
.                             Dm
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
.                             F
 And this house just ain't no home,
.Am
 Anytime she goes away.

 Wonder this time where she's gone
 Wonder if she's gone to stay
.                             Dm
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
.                             F
 And this house just ain't no home,
.Am
 Anytime she goes away.

.                         GmAm                          Gm
 And I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I I
.Am
 know...
;To add fill, every fourth "I know, pound on Gm and slide down two frets to Am (same fingering)
.                             Dm
 Baby you're leaving me far behind
.                                Am
 There ain't sunshine when she's gone

;Repeat 1st verse

;This sounds great on a electric, not so great on an acoustic. For
;acoustic, I strum continuously between "picks", and for the "I know"
;business I pound the strings holding down only the second string
;of the first fret, then hammer down onto an Am.</lyrics>

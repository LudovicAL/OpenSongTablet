;acoustic version as done on "Twee Meter Sessies (deel 2)"

.  E                       A             B
 I sing myself to sleep, a song from the darkest hours
.E                      A             B
 Secrets I can't keep inside all the days
.E                         A         B
 Swing from high to deep extremes of sweet and sour
.E                       A       B
 Hope that God exists, I hope, I pray
.E                          A                 B
 Drawn by the undertone, my life is out of control
.E                                 A                 B
 I believe this wave-well, bear my weight, so let it flow

;chorus
[C
.       E
 Oh sit down, oh sit down, oh sit down
 (sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down)
.A                B
 Sit down next to  me
.    E                           A           B
 Sit down, down, down, down, dow-own in sympathy
 (sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down)
[

 Now I'm relieved to hear that you've been to some far out places
 It's hard to carry on when you feel all alone
 Now I've swung back down again, it's worse than it was before
 If I had to see such riches I could live with being poor

;chorus

.E                                     A                B
 Those who feel the breath of sadness, sit down next to me
.E                                          A                B
 Those who find they're touched by madness, sit down next to me
.E                                     A                B
 Those who find themselves ridiculous, sit down next to me
.E    D# D C# C B A#     A        B
 Down                             

;chorus (2x)

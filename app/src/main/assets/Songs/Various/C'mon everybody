 Well c'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
.E
 I got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right
.       A                 B
 Been a-doin' my homework all week long
.        A                  B
 now the house is empty the folks are gone
.N.C.                E    A    B    A    E
 Ooo C'mon everybody                     

 Well my baby's number one but I'm gonna dance with three or four
 And the house'll be shakin' from my bare feet slapping the floor
 When you hear that music you can't sit still
 If your brother won't rock then your sister will
 Ooo C'mon everybody

 Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside
 If the folks come home I'm afraid they gonna have my hide
 There'll be no more movies for a week or two
 No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew
 Who cares C'mon everybody</lyrics>

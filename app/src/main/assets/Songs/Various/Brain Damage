;Intro - D (high E and B strings, you'll know) for 8 bars)

.D                     G7
 The lunatic is on the grass
.D                     G7
 The lunatic is on the grass
.D                     E*
 Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
.A7(9+)                         D
 Got to keep the loonies on the path.

.D                     G7
 The lunatic is in the hall
.D                      G7
 The lunatics are in my hall
.D                            E*
 The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
.    A7(9+)                        D
 And every day the paperboy brings more

.D/F#                       E
 And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
.    G                            D/F#
 And if there is no room upon the hill
.                               E
 And if your head explodes with dark forbodings too
.     G                               D/F#
 I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

.D                    G7
 The lunatic is in my head
.D                    G7
 The lunatic is in my head
.D                    E*
 You raise the blade, you make the change
.A7(9+)                    D
 You rearrange me till I'm sane
.D                     E*
 You lock the door and throw away the key
.        A7(9+)                          D
 There's someone in my head but it's not me

.D/F#                    E
 And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear
.G                             D/F#
 You shout and no one seems to hear
.                                 E
 And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
.     G                               D/F#
 I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.</lyrics>

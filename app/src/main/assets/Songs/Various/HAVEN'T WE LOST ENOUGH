;(riff 2x)
.Em      G        Am9       Em        G            Am9
 I was with you, you were alone, now I'm standing here
.Em      G         Am9         Em
 Wisdom came only after you'd gone
.          G                      C
 So I'm starting all over with a tear in my eye
.         D                    Em
 I just never thought you'd disappear (riff 2x)

 In the night your image arises and close behind comes the pain
 I hope I dream cos it hurts so bad
 When I reached out for you, I'm alone in some room
 I just never thought you'd disappear

;CHORUS:
.G   D    Am9             Em                    D
 I still love you like a child, wasn't I good enough?
.G   D    Am9                 Em                        D
 I still want you, drives me wild, haven't we had it rough?
.                  Em
 Haven't we lost enough?  (riff 2x)

 Time heals all, so they say, I don't know
 Sometimes nothing is clear
 Maybe someday I'll understand but I know for a start
 There's a place in my heart that is yours
 And it won't disappear

;EXTENDED CHORUS:
 I still love you like a child, wasn't I good enough?
 I still want you, drives me wild, haven't we had it rough?
 I still love you like a child, wasn't I good enough?
 I still want you, drives me wild, haven't we had it rough?
 Haven't we lost enough?</lyrics>

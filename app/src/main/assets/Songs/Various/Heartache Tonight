[Intro] C   Bb   F   F#   G

.N.C.
 Somebody's gonna hurt someone before the night is through
.N.C.
 Somebody's gonna come undone there's nothing we can do
.G                  Em             G               Em
 Everybody wants to touch somebody If it takes all night
.G                  C                    G                D
 Everybody wants to take a little chance make it come out right
.G                  C7                                       G
 There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know
.G                  C7                                      A           D
 There's gonna be a heartache tonight a heartache tonight I know Lord I know

.G                   Em            G                              Em
 Some people like to stay out late Some folks can't hold out that long
.    G               C           G                       D
 but nobody wants to go home now There's to much goin' on
.G                   Em           G                        Em
 This night is gonna last forever last all last all summer long
.G                   C            G                  D
 Sometime before the sun comes up the radio is gonna play that song
.D                  C7                                      G
 There's gonna be a heartache tonight a heartache tonight I know
.G                  C7                                      A           D
 There's gonna be a heartache tonight a heartache tonight I know Lord I know
.D                  G                     G
 There's gonna be a heartache tonight the moon's shining bright
.   C                      C#dim
 so turn out the light and we'll get it right
.                  G                   D                   G
 Theres gonna be a heartache tonight a heartache tonight I know

 C     Bb     F     F#     G        C     Bb     F     F#    G

.N.C.
 Somebody's gonna hurt someone before the night is through
.N.C.
 Somebody's gonna come undone there's nothing we can do
.G                  Em             G               Em
 Everybody wants to touch somebody If it takes all night
.G                  C                    G                D
 Everybody wants to take a little chance make it come out right
.G                  C7                                       G

 There's gonna be a heartache tonight a heartache tonight I know let's go

.       G
 We can beat around the bushes we can get down to the bone
.       C                                C#dim
 we can leave it in the parking lot, but either way there's gonna be a
.G                   D                   G         C7
 heartache tonight a heartache tonight I know oh I know
.             G                   D                   G
 Therell be a heartache tonight a heartache tonight I know

.Fmaj7
 How can I be sure
.          G
 When your own intrusion is my illusion?
.Fmaj7
 How can I be sure?
.     G
 When all the time you changed my mind
.  Fmaj7
 I asked for more and more.
.Am
 How can I be sure?

[C
.C                      Am        G            D
 When you don't give me love (you give me Pale Shelter)
.C                 Am        G            D
 You don't give me love (you give me cold hands)
.    C          Am     G     D
 And I can't operate on this failure
.     C             Am    D                    C         F         B7
 When all I want to be is completely in command

.Fmaj7
 How can I be sure,
.    G
 For all you say you keep me waiting
.Fmaj7
 How can I be sure,
.     G
 When all you do is see me through
.  Fmaj7
 I asked for more and more,
.Am
 How can I be sure

;Chorus

.Fmaj7
 I've been here before,
.      G
 There is no why, no need to try,
.  Fmaj7
 I thought you had it all,
.    G
 I'm calling you, I'm calling you,
.  Fmaj7
 I ask for more and more,
.Am
 How can I be sure?

;Chorus

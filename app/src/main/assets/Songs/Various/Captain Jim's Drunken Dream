.        G                     Em7                     G          Em7
 Now you country fools in your one-horse town, you can laugh at me
.     G                         Em7                    G           Em7
 It's plain as rain that you've never been down to the southern sea
.   G                  Em7                G       Em7
 To see me now is like watching a fish on dry land
.  G                   Em7                F/C C
 I only wish you could see me down in the is- lands
.C        D        G
 Mister, that's my home
.       F             C              Am7            C/D     G Em7 G Em7
 What a fool I was to leave the only happiness I've known.          

.        G                     Em7                     G              Em7
 You see me comin', you wink your eye and call me Captain Jim         
.           G                       Em7
 And when I don't do nothin' but to walk on by you say,
.G                  Em7
  "Baby get a load of him."
.G                 Em7                 G              Em7
 All I need is the sea and the sky and I know where I stand
.  G                           Em7                F/C               C
 instead of you hicks straight out of the sticks deciding I ain't a man
.C        D              G
 You'll never understand;
.   F               C               Am7              D
 Up here I'm just a whiskey bum but down there I'm a king
.   F                    C               Am7           Dsus4
 It sounds just like the angels up in heaven when they sing:
.D7       G    Em7   G           Em7    G                Em7
 "Welcome home,      welcome home."   -- Such a sight to see
.   F                C     G/B  Am7
 instead of some Salvation Army sister singin'
. C/D              G     Em7 G Em7
 "Nearer My God to Thee."      

.      G                     Em7       G              Em7
 Now I know that the Yankee whiskey is takin' away my mind
.      G                    Em7        G               Em7
 and I know that run is the only drink suitable to man-kind
.      G                       Em7      G                 Em7
 And I know that this tree I'm under is shaped entirely wrong
.  G              Em7                F/C               C
 I need to see a gentle palm tree and I won't wait too long
.       C             D          G
 I can feel that it's comin' on strong
.    F                  C         Am7            D
 The first cold wind of winter is flappin' in my clothes
.F              C               Am7            C/D
 Showin' me the way with the direction that it blows.
.        G     Em              G         Em7
 Welcome home,      welcome home, let it blow. (repeat and fade)</lyrics>

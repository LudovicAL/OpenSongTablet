;Intro:
.C       C/Bb    F/A    C/G       F      Dm
                                         
.G             C/G      G7                 F/C  C      F/C        C
 I can't light            no more of your darkness                
.F                                              G   C/G    G       C/G
 All my pictures seem to fade to black and white                   
.G                C/G      G7                        F/C  C     C7/E
 I'm growing tired           and time stands still before me    
.F          Bb/F       F                   G        C/G      G7
 Frozen here           on the ladder of my life              

.                   C/G       G7                    C       F/C     C        C7/E
 It's much too late             to save myself from falling                  
.F               Bb/F       F                            G     C/G       G
 I took a chance             and changed your way of life                
.G7              C/G       G                  F/C   C     C7/E
 But you misread            my meaning when I met you     
.F                               C/G              G      F/G
 Closed the door and left me blinded by the light        

;Chorus:

.C                    C/Bb
 Don't let the sun go down on me
.Am7                                   D7/F#
 Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
.C/G                               F/G     G7                C      C/Bb
 I'd just allow a fragment of your life      to wander free         
.    F/A                           Dm  C/E  F  C/G  F/G   C
 But losing everything is like the sun  going down   on   me

;(repeat intro chords)

 I can't find oh the right romantic line
 But see me once and see the way I feel
 Don't discard me (baby no) just because you think I mean you harm
 But these cuts I have, oh they need love to help me heal Oh..

;(repeat chorus)

;Ending:
.         C         C/Bb      F/A        Ab     Bb     C
..down on me</lyrics>

 Intro/Fill/[Outro] D-Bm-Am-C9-Ebmaj7-Bb

.D                                             G
 Got a call from an old friend we'd used to be real close
.A                                   D
 Said he couldn't go on the American way
.                                                        G
 Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
.A                                         D
 Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A. (-Fill-)
.D                                           G
 I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm allright
.A                                             D
 I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
.                                          G
 I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
.A                                         Bm
 Go ahead with your own life leave me alone
.                                    F#
 I never said you had to offer me a second chance
.D7                             E9
 I never said I was a victim of circumstance
.G            D
 I still belong
.F#           Bm
 Don't get me wrong
.E9
 And you can speak your mind
.    G   A  G  A
 But not on my time
.D                                             G
 They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
.A                                               D
 Then they'll tell you can't sleep with somebody else
.                                         G
 Ah but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
.A                                         D
 Either way it's O.K. you wake up with yourself</lyrics>

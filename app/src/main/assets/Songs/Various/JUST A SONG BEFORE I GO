;CHORUS #1:
. Em           Bm
 Just a song before I go
.     C           Am
 To whom it may concern
.  Em                   Bm
 Travelling twice the speed of sound
.       C          Am
 It's easy to get burned

.  G                  F
 When the shows were all over
.    Am              Bm
 We had to get back home
.     G              F
 And when we opened up the door
.         Am
 I had to be alone

;CHORUS #2:
 She helped me with my suitcase
 She stands before my eyes
 Driving me to the airport
 And to the friendly skies

 Going through security
 I held her for so long
 She finally looked at me in love
 And she was gone

;REPEAT CHORUS #1</lyrics>

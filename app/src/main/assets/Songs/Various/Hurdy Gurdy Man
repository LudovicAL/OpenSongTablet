.G                     Bm              C                D7
 Thrown like a star in my vast sleep I open my eyes to take a peep
.G                  Bm         C               D7
 To find that I was by the sea gazing with tranquility
.      F                    C              G
 'Twas then that the Hurdy Gurdy Man came singing songs of love
.F                    C             G             D7 G
 Then when the Hurdy Gurdy Man came singing songs of love

;Chorus
.F              C              G           D7 G
 Hurdy gurdy hurdy gurdy hurdy gurdy gurdy he sang     (3 times)
.F   C   G   G
             

 Histories of ages past unenlightened shadows cast
 Down through all eternity the crying of humanity
 'Tis then that the Hurdy Gurdy Man comes singing songs of love
 Then that the Hurdy Gurdy Man comes singing songs of love

.F#m                                        A
  Ticking away the moments that make up the  dull day,
.E                                           F#m
  Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand   way
.                                            A
 Kicking around on a piece of ground in your   home town
.E                                                 F#m
  Waiting for someone or something to show you the  way

.Dm7
  Tired of lying in the sunshine,
.Am7
  Staying home to watch the rain,
.Dm7
  You are young and life is long
.Am7
  ??????
.Dm7                        C#m
  And then one day you find  ten years have got behind you
.Bm
  No one told you when to run
.E                        E7
  You missed the starting  gun

.        F#m                                        A
 And you  run, you catch up with the sun - but it's  sinking
.E                                    F#m
  Racing around to come up behind you  again
.                                               A
 The sun is the same in a relative way but your   older
.E                                        F#m
  Shorter of breath and one day closer to  death

.Dm7
  Every year is getting shorter
.Am7
  Never seem to find the time
.Dm7
  Plans that either come to naught
.Am7
  Or half a page of scribbled lines
.Dm7                        C#m
  Hanging on in quiet despe--ration is the English way
.    Bm
 The  time is gone the song is over
.Bm7                                F
  thought I'd something more to say.</lyrics>

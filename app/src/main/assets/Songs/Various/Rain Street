;Intro:
.C  F G  C   F G  C  F G
                       
.    C
 The church bell rings

 An old drunk sings
.                       F  C    G
 A young girl hocks her wedding ring
.        C
 Down on Rain Street

.C
 Down the alley the icewagon flew
.                           F   C   G
 Picked up a stiff that was turning blue
.    C               F       C      G
 The local kids were sniffin'   glue
.      C                      F C  G
 There aint much else for kids  to do
.     C
 Down Rain Street

;Verse 3
 Father McGreer buys an ice cold beer
 And a short for Father Loyola
 Father Joe's got the clap again
 He's drinking Coca-Cola
 Down on Rain Street

 Bless me Father I have sinned
 I got pissed and I got pinned
 And God can't help the shape I'm in
 Down on Rain Street

;Verse 5
 There's a Tesco on the sacred ground
 Where I pulled her knickers down
 While Judas took his measly price
 And St Anthony gazed in awe at Christ
 Down on Rain Street

.  C
 I gave my love a goodnight kiss
.                  F    C/E   G/D
 I tried to take a late night piss
.        C                F      C/E  G/D
 But the toilet moved so again I mis- sed
.     C          F G
 Down Rain Street

;Verse 7
 I sat on the floor and watched TV
 Thanking Christ for the BBC
 A stupid fucking place to be
 Down Rain Street

;Verse 8
 I took my Eileen by the hand
 Walk with me was her command
 I dreamt we were walking on the strand
 Down Rain Street

.C  F    G     C          F     G      C
    That night Rain Street went on for miles       / repeat &amp; fade   \
.F      G        C          F         C      F G    C             F G
   That night on Rain Street somebody smiled        (Rain Street)</lyrics>

[Intro]                  

.G                               G/F#  Em
 The family circle gathers round from very far and near
.   D               C                 G
 To pass around the same remarks they passed away last year
.    G                          G/F# Em
 The little girl you dangled on your knee without mishap
.      D                 C          G
 Stirs something in your memory and something in your lap

;Chorus:
.    Am                  Em
 The juniper berry has a very deadly kiss
.Bb                               D
 I believe that something here is very much amiss
.G                G/F# Em
 But its a living and  this is the life
.        D     C       D
 For the world and his wife
.          C#      F#m
 The world and his wife

.    Am                              Em
 The kissing cousins step outside to cuddle and confess
.Bb                                D
 She says sweet nothing at all its much more of a mess
.         G         G/F# Em
 She says our mother and someone elses father
.D                  C          G
 Went for two weeks holiday in Taramasalata
.G                       G/F#    Em
 Daddy went out with the rubbish and he kept on talking
.  D                 C              G
 Between Mum and the walls god only knows who does the talking

;Chorus

 (Verse 3 same as verse 2)
 The conversation melts like chocolate down our open jaws
 Through the loud appeal of laughter
 and the counting score drawers
 But later on in the evening through the tears and fol de rol
 Come the setimental feelings of the lure of vitriol
 Longing thoughts go hankering for the old home overseas
 With a blindfold and a national anthem sung in different keys

;Chorus,(Except instead of C# and F#m, just play D and C and repeat again)</lyrics>

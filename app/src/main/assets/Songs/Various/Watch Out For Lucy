.A E7A E7
       

.    A                          D
 Now  my friend Bill was just a  working lad
.       C#                 D
 And he  liked to have his  fun.
.             A                    E
 He'd like to  find a girl and get  comfortable
.         D                E7
 When his  working day was  done.

.         F#m                       C#7
 He would  spend all his money on a  Friday night,
.D                       A
  Wake up in the morning  broke,
.       F#m                       C#7
 But he  had a run in with little  Lucy then;
.  D                      E7
 Believe me that ain't no  joke.

.A      C#7      F#m    D
  Watch  out for  Lucy, 
.A           C#7       F#m     D
  Though she  may look  frail. 
.         A        C#7
 Said, "Excuse me,  Lucy,
.F#m                D
  Darling don't you  use me;
.A                E7       A
  I don't want to  land in  jail."

.A C#7 F#m D
       
.A E7A E7
       

.    A                         D
 She  started out working in a  cafe,
.        C#               D
 Picking  money up on the  side.
.        A               E
 She was  free and easy,  everybody's friend,
.        D                 E7
 But she  couldn't be satisfied.

.       F#m                     C#7
 So now  in walks Bill with his  cash in his hand,
.    D               A
 His  heart upon his  sleeve.
.   F#m                 C#7
 We  tried to warn him about her ways,
.   D             E7
 We  never did succeed.

;Chorus

.A C#7 F#m D
       
.A E7A E7
       

.          A                    D
 Well, the  trap was sprung for  poor old Bill;
.                C#                 D
 You should have  heard little Lucy  sing
.          A                E
 "I want a  Cadillac car, a  beautiful home,
.      D                E7
 And a  thousand dollar  ring."

.     F#m                    C#7
 They  found our hero in the  gutter
.       D                   A
 With a  diamond ring and a  gun.
.     F#m                      C#7
 He'd  done it for the love of  Lucy
.    D                E7
 And  ended up on the  run.

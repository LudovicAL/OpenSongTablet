;John Lennon/Paul McCartney
.       D          C     G
 In the town where I was born
.Em      Am                 D
 Lived a man who sailed the sea.
.               C      G
 And he told us of his life
.Em     Am           D
 In the land of submarines.

 So we sailed up to the sun
 'Till we found the sea of green,
 And we lived beneath the waves
 In our yellow submarine.

.G                D
 We all live in a yellow submarine,
.                  G
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
.G                D
 We all live in a yellow submarine,
.                  G
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

 And our friends are all aboard,
 Many more of them live next door,
 And the band begins to play.

 We all live in a yellow submarine,
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
 We all live in a yellow submarine,
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

 As we live a life of ease,
 Everyone of us has all we need.
 Sky of blue and sea of green
 In our yellow submarine.

 We all live in a yellow submarine,
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
 We all live in a yellow submarine,
 Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

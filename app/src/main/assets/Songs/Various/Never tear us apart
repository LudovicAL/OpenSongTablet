.      Am              F
 Don't ask me what you know is true
.              Dm          F
 Don't have to tell you, I love your precious heart

;Chorus:
.C  F     C        F        C
 I, I was standing you were there
.F          C         F            G
 two worlds colliding and they can never tear us apart...

 We could live
 For a thousand years
 But if I hurt you
 I'd make wine from your tears

 I told you
 That we could fly
 'Cause we all have wings
 But some of us don't know why

;Chorus

; Follow the same pattern for the other verses and chorus.  One more
; comment about strumming, it's actually 12 downstrokes for each chord
; of the verse and 6 downstrokes for each chord of the chorus.

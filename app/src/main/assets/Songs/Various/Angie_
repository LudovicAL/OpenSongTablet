.Am     E     F               G               C
 Angie, Angie When will those clouds all disappear?
.Am     E     F              G           C
 Angie, Angie Where were the ladies from here?
.        G                          Dm           Am
 With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
.C         F               G
 You can't say we're satisfied
.Am     E     F         G            C
 Angie, Angie You can't say we never tried

.Am            E               F            G                C
 Angie, you're beautiful...yes but ain't it time we said goodbye
.Am             E        F        G                   C
 Angie, I still love you Remember all those nights we cried
.        G                               Dm           Am
 All the dreams we held so close Seem to all go up in smoke
.C         F               G
 Oh let me whisper in your ear
.Am     E     F              G           C
 Angie, Angie Where were the ladies from here?

.   G
 Oh Angie don't you weep
.         Dm                 Am
 All your kisses still taste sweet
.C           F               G
 I hate that sadness in your eyes
.    Am     E     F        G                C
 but Angie, Angie Ain't it time we said goodbye...ya
.        G                          Dm           Am
 With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
.C            F              G
 Oh you can't say we're satisfied
.    Am                      E    F             G               C
 but Angie, I still love you baby Every where I look I see your eyes

.Am                             E
 There ain't a woman that comes close to you
.F       G             C
 Come on baby dry your eyes
.Am     E     F        G           C
 Angie, Angie Ain't it good to be alive
.Am     E     F          G            F E DmC
 Angie, Angie They can't say we never tried</lyrics>

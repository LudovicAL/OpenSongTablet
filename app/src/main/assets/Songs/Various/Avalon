. F       C
 Now the party's over
. A#     C
 I'm so tired
. F      C
 Then I see you coming
. A#     C
 Out of nowhere
. F       C        A#     C
 Much communication in a motion
. F       C          A#
 Without conversation or a notion

                       Avalon         

 When the samba takes you
 Out of nowhere
 And the background's fading
 Out of focus
 Yes the picture's changing
 Every moment
 And your destination
 You don't know it

 Avalon

 When you bossanova
 There's no holding
 Would you have me dancing
 Out of nowhere

 Avalon...</lyrics>

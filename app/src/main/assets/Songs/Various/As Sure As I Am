 INTRO:  D   C

.D         C
 Make your decision now
.D          C
 Rely on no help from above
.D         C
 Living is luxury
.G      Am                   F
 I want everything you throw out
.G       Am                D
 I'll do anything you want to

 Please let me go with you
 I'll wear the smile on your face
 Big black and beautiful
 I want it, everything you throw out
 There must be something you can do without

.  F#    G#        C#
 I am as sure as I am
.                    F#
 And I couldn't care less
.    G#            C#
 For what might go wrong
.                 F#
 And I'm happy as sin
.     G#          Bbm  G
 In a fear shaken world

 I pity the rhino
 Down there it's becoming extinct
 Killed for a love potion
 Sad thing looking like a dead flower
 I want it, everything that you throw out

.  F#    G#        C#
 I am as sure as I am
.                    F#
 And I couldn't care less
.    G#            C#
 For what might go wrong
.                 F#
 And I'm happy as sin
.     G#          Bbm  EbBbm Eb
 In a fear shaken world    

.G# F#
 No one will be left
.G# F#
 No one will be spared
.G#            F#
 I'll wear the smile on your face

.  F#    G#        C#
 I am as sure as I am
.                    F#
 And I couldn't care less
.    G#            C#
 For what might go wrong
.                 F#
 And I'm happy as sin
.     G#          A      B     A/C#* B/D#*
 In a fear shaken world, world    
.              Bbm
 Couldn't care less

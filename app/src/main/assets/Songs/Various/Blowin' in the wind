. C        F            C
 How many roads must a man walk down,
.                F          C
 before you can call him a man?
.          F            C
 How many seas must a white dove sail,
.             Dm           G7
 before she sleeps in the sand?
.          C        F              C
 Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly,
.                  F     C
 before they're forever banned?
.    Dm           G7         C             Am
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
.    F           G7            C
 the answer is blowing in the wind.

.                   F            C
 Yes, and how many times must a man look up,
.               F           C
 before he can see in the sky?
.                  F         C
 Yes, and how many ears must one man have,
.               Dm           G7
 before he can hear people cry?
.          C        F              C
 Yes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows
.               F           C
 that too many people have died?
.    Dm           G7         C             Am
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
.    F           G7            C
 the answer is blowing in the wind

.                   F           C
 Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist,
.             F             C
 before it's washed to the sea?
.                   F              C
 Yes, and how many years can some people exist,
.                  Dm           G7
 before they're allowed to be free?
.          C        F           C
 Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head,
.               F            C
 pretending he just doesn't see?
.    Dm           G7         C             Am
 The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
.    F           G7            C
 the answer is blowing in the wind</lyrics>

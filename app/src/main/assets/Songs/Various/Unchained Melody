.G       Em       C              D                G
 Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for your touch
.   Em           D
 A long, lonely time
.   G        Em     C          D              G
 As time goes by so slowly and time can do so much
.    Em         D
 Are you still mine
.   G              D     Em             Bm
 I need your love,    I need your love  
.    C               D     G   G7
 God speed your love to--- me  

.C             D           C          Bb
 Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
.C            D           G
 To the open arms of the sea
. C             D             C            Bb
 Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me
.C               D             G
 I'll be coming home, wait for me

 Oh, my love, my darling, I hunger, hunger!, for your love,
 For love.  Lonely time.
 And time goes by, so slowly, and time can do so much,
 Are you still mine?
 I need your love, I need your love.
 God speed your love to me.</lyrics>

.E
 My baby drove up in a brand new cadillac
.   A                                E
 My baby drove up in a brand new cadillac
. B7                         A
 She said "Hey come here big Daddy"
.N.C.                E       B
 I ain't ever commin back    

.E
 baby baby won't you hear my plea
. A                         E
 C'mon just come on back to me
.         B7               A
 She said balls to you  Daddy
.N.C.                E          B
 She ain't commin back to me    

.E
 Baby drove up in a cadillac
.        A                                        E
 I said "Jesus Christ, where did you get that cadillac
.         B7            A
 She said balls to you Daddy
.N.C.                    E          B
 She ain't never coming back</lyrics>

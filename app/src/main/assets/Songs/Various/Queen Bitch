.C                                    F                     C     G F   C G
 I'm up on the eleventh floor and I'm watching the cruisers below         
.F    C                           F                          C   G F   C G
 He's down on the street and he's trying hard to pull sister Flo         
.F     C                          F                        C    G F   C G
 Oh my hearts in the basement, my weekend's at an all time low          
.F         C                   F                         C
 Cos she's hopin to score so I can't see her letting him os she's go
.                E                      Am
 Walk out of her heart, walk out of her mind, no not her

;Chorus
.         B                       D           B                               D
 She's so swishy in her satin and tat, in her frockcoat and bipperty boppirty hat
.       B                      C      G F   C G F   C G F   C G
 Oh God I could do better than that                           

.F        C                      F                            C     G F   C G
 She's an old time ambassador of sweet talking, night walking games         
.F         C                              F                    C     G F   C G
 And she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames         
.   F       C                           F                           C    G F  C G
 If she say she can do it, then she can do it, she don't make false claims      
.    F       C                                   F
 For she's a queen and such are queens that your laughter is sucked in their brains
.E                         F
 But now she's leading him on and she'll lay him right down
.C                     F
 Now she's leading him on and she'll lay him right down
.E                         F                      C
 But it could have been me yes it could have been me
.             E                A
 Why didn't I say why didn't I say, no no no

;Chorus

.F    C                     F                C    G F   C G
 So I lay down awhile and I gaze at my hotel wall         
.F      C                  F                         C   G F   C G
 Oh the cot is so cold, it don't feel like no bed at all         
.F      C               F                C    G F   C G
 Yeah I lay down awhile look at my hotel wall         
.F        C                              F                      E
 But he's down on the street, so I throw both his bags down the hall,
.                      F                     C
 And I'm phoning a cab 'cos my stomach feels small
.                      F                          E
 There's a taste in my mouth and it's no taste at all
.                   F                          C
 It could have been me, yes it could have been me
.             E                 A
 Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no no no

.Em/G            D6               CM7                B7-9B7
 "The problem is all inside your head," she said to me   
.Em              D#dim7     GM9+5         B+
 "the answer is easy if you take it logic'lly.
.Em          D6                 CM7             B7-9
 I'm here to help you if you're struggling to be free;
.       B7     Em    Am7                Em
 there must be fifty ways to leave your lover."

.Em/G            D6            CM7         B7-9    B7
 She said, "It's really not my habit to intrude;   
.Em        D#dim7           GM9+5         B+
 I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued.
.     Em           D6          CM7           B7-9
 But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude;
.       B7     Em    Am7                Em
 there must be fifty ways to leave your lover."
.Em    Am7                Em
 fifty ways to leave your lover."

.                  G
 Just slip out the back, Jack.
.           Bb6
 Make a new plan, Stan;
.                     C7
 You don't need to be coy, Roy,
.                  G
 just get yourself free.    (on repeat:  Just listen to me)

.           G
 Hop on the bus, Gus;
.                     Bb6
 You don't need to discuss much;
.                  C7
 Just drop off the key, Lee.
.                  G
 and get yourself free.

;REPEAT CHORUS

;Second verse:
 She said, "It grieves me now to see you in such pain; I
 wish there was somethin' I could do to make you smile again."
 I said, "I appreciate that, and could you please explain about the
 fifty ways?"

 She said, "Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight;
 I'm sure in the morning you'll begin to see the light."
 And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right; there must be
 fifty ways to leave your lover,
 fifty ways to leave your lover."

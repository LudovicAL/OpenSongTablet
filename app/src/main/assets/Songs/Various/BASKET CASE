;Green Day

;VERSE:
.Eb              Bb    C               G
 Do you have the time, to listen to me whine
.G#                Eb                Bb
 About nothing and everything all at once
.Eb          Bb     C             G
 I am one of those, mellodramatic fools
.G#                   Eb             Bb
 Neurotic to the bone no doubt about it.

;CHORUS:
.G#          Bb              Eb
 Sometimes I give myself the creeps
.G#           Bb                   Eb
 Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
.G#           Bb         Eb      C#           C
 It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
.G#        Bb                 Eb
 Am I just paranoid? I'm just stoned.

;Bridge?:

;Verse:
 I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
 She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
 I went to a whore, she said my life's a bore
 And quit my whining cause it's bringing her down.</lyrics>

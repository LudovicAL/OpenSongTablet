;David Bowie
;album, "Aladdin Sane"

.                       F#m G A G A F#m
 The intro piano plays:      

.             F#m
 She'll come, she'll go
.           G
 She'll lay belief on you
.                 A
 Skin sweet with musky oil
.    G#m                       B
 The lady from another grinning soul
.       F#m
 Cologne she'll wear
.      G
 Silver and Americard
.             A
 She'll drive a beetle car
.G#m                       B
 And beat you down at cool Canasta

.             Ebm              B
 And when the clothes are strewn
.          Bb          B
 Don't be afraid of the room
.                          C#
 Touch the fullness of her breast
.                 E
 Feel the love of her caress
.                     G#m   F#m
 She will be your living end

.F#m G A G#m B
     

 She'll come she'll go
 She'll lay belief on you
 But she won't stake her life on you
 How can life become point of view

 And when the clothes are strewn
 Don't be afraid of the room
 Touch the fullness of her breast
 Feel the love of her caress
 She will be your living end
 She will be your living end

;
; As Bowie is singing "She will be your living end" the chords are G#m, G, G#m,
; Bb, G#m, G, G#m, Bb until the song fades out.

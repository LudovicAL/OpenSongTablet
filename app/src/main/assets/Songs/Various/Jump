 I get up, and nothing gets me down.
 You got it tough. I've seen the toughest around.
 And I know, baby, just how you feel.
 You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real

.             Am              G
 Oh can't you see me standing here,
.            A            G             F    C  Dm
 I've got my back against the record machine    
.                              F     C  Dm
 I ain't the worst that you've seen.    
.                        F      C  G
 Oh can't you see what I mean ?    

 Might as well jump. Jump !
 Might as well jump.
 Go ahead, jump. Jump !
 Go ahead, jump.

 Aaa-ohh Hey you ! How said that ?
 Baby how you been ?
 You say you don't know, you won't know
 until we begin.

;interlude

 Might as well jump. Jump !
 Go ahead, jump.
 Might as well jump. Jump !
 Go ahead, jump.

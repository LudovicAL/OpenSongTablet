.                                          DABm
 Last time I saw her it was turning colder   
.                        GA
 But that was years ago.  
.                                      DABm
 Last I heard she had moved to Boulder   
.                                  GEm A
 But where she's now I don't know.   
.                                              GF#m Bm
 But there's something 'bout this time of year   
.                           GF#m Em A
 That spins my head around.    
.                               DABm
 Takes me back, makes me wonder   
.                      GEm D
 What's she doing now.   

.                                                   G A Bm F#m Bm
 'Cause what's she's doing now is tearin' me apart.     
.                                          AGAD
 Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart.    
.                                                   GF#m Bm
 I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows,   
.                                                GEm A D
 And I wonder if she knows what she's doin' now.    

.                                         DABm
 Just for laughs I dialed her old number,   
.                          GA
 But no one knew her name.  
.                                          DABm
 Hung up the phone, sat there and wondered   
.                             GEm A
 If she'd ever done the same.   
.                                  GF#m Bm
 I took a walk in the evenin' wind   
.                          GF#m Em A
 To clear my head somehow.    
.                                DABm
 But tonight I lie here thinkin'   
.                      GEm D
 What's she doin' now?   

.                                                   G ABm F#m Bm
 'Cause what's she's doing now is tearin' me apart.      
.                                          AGAD
 Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart.    
.                                                   GF#m Bm
 I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows,   
.                          GEm A
 And I wonder if she knows   
.                                               G ABm F#m Bm
 that what she's doing now is tearin' me apart.      
.                                          AGAD
 Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart.    
.                                                   GF#m Bm
 I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows,   
.                                                GEm A D
 And I wonder if she knows what she's doin' now.

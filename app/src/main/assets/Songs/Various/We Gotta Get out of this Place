;Bass Intro
;G F G chord progression
 In this dirty old part of the city
 Where the sum refuse to shine
 People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'
 My little girl your so young and pretty
 And One thing I know is true
 Your gonna die before your timeis thru

 See my daddy in bed a- dying
 See his hair a turning grey
 He's been working an slavin his life away
 He's been workin yeah
 Slavin his life away
 He's been WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK
;(Strum with a little more intensity and build during "WORK WORK WORK WORK WORK")

;Break
.C                  F           G
 Yeah we gotta get out of this Place
.C                  D           G
 If it's the last thing we ever do
.C                  F           G
 Yeah we gotta get out of this Place

 Girl there's a better place for me and You

 Come over to the window, my little darling,
.D             D                   A
 I'd like to try to read your palm.

   I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy,
.F#m                             E Esus4
   before I let you take me home.

      Now so long, Marianne,    it's time that we began to
.E  Esus4   E   E7   E Esus4
 laugh  and cry and  cry  and
.E       E7            A      Asus4 A Asus4 A
 laugh about it all again.

 Well you know that I love to live with you,
 but you make me forget so very much.
 I forget to pray for the angels
 and then the angels forget to pray for us.

;Chorus

 We met when we were almost young
 deep in the green lilac park.
 You held on to me like I was a crucifix,
 as we went kneeling through the dark.

;Chorus

 Your letters they all say that you're beside me now.
 Then why do I feel alone?
 I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
 is fastening my ankle to a stone.

;Chorus

 For now I need your hidden love.
 I'm cold as a new razor blade.
 You left when I told you I was curious,
 I never said that I was brave.

;Chorus

 Oh, you are really such a pretty one.
 I see you've gone and changed your name again.
 And just when I climbed this whole mountainside,
 to wash my eyelids in the rain!

;Chorus

 Oh your eyes, well I forgot Your eyes
 Your body's at home in every sea.
 How come you gave away your news to everyone
 That you said was a secret for me.

;Chorus

 If you leave, where will I keep you then
 In my heart as some men say
 But I who was born to love everyone
 Why should I keep you so far away?

[Intro]                 

. D                   G             D
 There's a place out on the edge of town, sir,
.                  G              D
 Risin' above the factories and the fields
.      G                                D
 Now, ever since I was a child, I can remember
.     A7             D
 That mansion on the hill

 In the day you can see the children playing
 On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel
 Steel gates that completely surround, sir,
 The mansion on the hill

 At night my daddy'd take me and we'd ride
 Through the streets of a town so silent and still
 Park on a back road along the highway side
 Look up at that mansion on the hill

 In the summer all the lights would shine
 There'd be music playin', people laughin' all the time
 Me and my sister, we'd hide out in the tall cornfields
 Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill

 Tonight down here in Linden Town
 I watch the cars rushin' by, home from the mill
 There's a beautiful full moon rising
 Above the mansion on the hill</lyrics>

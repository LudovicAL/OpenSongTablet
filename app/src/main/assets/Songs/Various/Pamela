.Am7   Am7/C  Am7/E   C/G     Ab5+     Am7   Am7/C Am7/E C/G Ab5+
 Side  by     side,  I'll be  yours   forever       
.Am7   Am7/C  Am7/E   C/G   Ab5+       Am7   Am7/C  Am7/E   G6
 Rain  or     shine,  any   kind  of weather                
.Am7  C/D  Dm              F  C/F         C/G  G        C/G  G/A
           There isn't   anything  I wouldn't  do   for you  
.Am7  C/D  Dm7                F   C/F         C/G      G    E5+
           Let's take what's get-ting old and make  it new  

.Am7  Am7/C   Am7/E       C/G      Ab5+    Am7  Am7/C Am7/E C/G Ab5+
 Eye  to      eye  it's a blinding confrontation      
.Am7  Am7/C   Am7/E      C/G    Ab5+  Am7  /C /E G6Am7
 You  and     I  we're a deadly  combination       
.Am7  C/D  Dm7          F  C/F              C/G  G   C/G G/A
           Don't start mix-ing  truth with jealousy   
.Am7  C/D  Dm7                    F      C/F       C/G     G      E5+
           The road we're on is clear  as far as I    can  see.

.        F     Dm7            F/Bb   Bb           F/A
 Just remember,   it  may not heal   this time    
.Gm7     Gm7/F             Em7/5-          Eb
 Pamela        there is no second chance   
.        Bb/D                Gm7    Ab      Fm6E7/5+
 For the one   who leaves it all   behind

;repeat second part intro twice

 Black and white  always go together
 Day  and  night you're the precious jewel I tresure
 Wanting ev'ry part of you is not a crime
 Well, could it be that you're the one that's wrong this time?

.C        G/C    F/A                         Dm7            E7/5+
 Oh  Pa-me-la     thousand of miles away but always in my    heart

;chorus (2x)

       It  all     behind

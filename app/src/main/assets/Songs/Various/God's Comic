.Em         B7         Em         B7
                                  
.Em         G           Am         A#    B
                                         
.Em           B7            Em     B7
 I wish you'd known me when I was alive
.G             C  D
 I was a funny feller
.Am7             B7       C          B7
 The crowd would hoot and holler for more
.Am7      B7          C           B7
 I wore a drunk's red nose for applause
.G               C       D
 Oh yes, I was a comical priest
.       G                        C           D
 With a joke for the flock and a hand up yourfleece
.Em                 B7          Em        D
 Drooling the drink  and the lipstick and grease-paint
.G                  C           D         C
 Down the cardboard front of my dirty dog collar

[C]
.G     B7      Em            B7            Em            D
       Now I'm dead, now I'm dead, now I'm dead, now I'm dead
.        G           C         D
 And I'm going on to meet my reward
.      Em            B7            Em            D
 I was scared, I was scared, I was scared, I was scared,
.G             C     D           C    G
 He might have never heard God's comic

.B7     Em          B7       Em    B7
        So there he was on a water bed
.G                    C       D
 Drinking a cola of a mystery brand
.Am7        B7      C    B7
 Reading an airport novelette
.Am7          B7           C        B7    Em
 Listening to Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Requiem'
.G                     C        D
 He said, befor it had really begun
.   G               C       D
 'I prefer the one about my son.'
.           Em             B7           Em       D
 'I've been wading through all this unbelievable junk
.    G                          C         D            C
 And wondering if I should have given the world to the monkeys.'

;chorus

.C            D
 I'm going to take a little trip
.C        D              G
 Down paradise's endless shores
 They say that travel broadens the mind,
.                        B7          E
 till you can't get your head out of doors

.Em         B7         Em         B7
                                  
.Em         G           Am         A#    B
                                         
.Em          B7          Em         B7
 I'm sitting here on the top of the world
.G                    C       D
 I hang around in the longest night
.Am7        B7        C       B7
 Until each beast has gone to bed
.Am7        B7       C          B7           Em
 And then I say 'God bless' and turn out the light.
.          G                 C        D
 While you lie in the dark, afraid to breathe
.        G                           C               D
 And you beg and you promise and you bargain and you plead.
.    G                         C     D
 Sometimes you confuse me with Santa Claus
.G                  C          D
 It's the big white beard I suppose.
.          Em     B7              Em           D
 I'm going up the pole, where you folks die of cold
.G          C          D            C
 I might be gone for a while if you need me.

;chorus
.G     B7      Em            B7            Em            D
       Now I'm dead, Now I'm dead, Now I'm dead, Now I'm dead,
.           G               C         D
 And you're all going on to meet your reward
.        Em              B7              Em              D
 Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared? Are you scared?
.G              C     D                C
 You might have never heard, but God's comic.

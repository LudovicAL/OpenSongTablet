. D11     G                    C
 All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
.      G                C
 I'm standing here outside your door
.    G              C              D7
 I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
.D11        G                    C
  but the dawn is breaking, its early morn'
.     G                      C
 the taxi is waiting, he's blowin' his horn.
.   G             C              D
 Already I'm so lonesome I could die.

[C

 So kiss me and sm

 ile for me.
. G                   C
 Tell me that you'll wait for me.
. G                   Am              D7
 Hold me like you'll never let me go. 
.            G      C
 'Cause I'm leavin' on a jetplane,
.G                  C           D7   G
  don't know when I'll be back again 
.      C            D7
 oh, babe I hate to go.

.  D11        G               C
 There's so many times I've let you down;
.     G                C
 So many times I've played around,
.    G            C                 D7
 I tell you now they don't mean a thing.
.D11      G               C
  Ev'ry place I go I'll think of you,
.       G                 C
 Ev'ry song I sing I'll sing for you.
.     G                  C               D
 When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring.

;Chorus

.D11 G               C
  Now the time has come to leave you,
.G                  C
 one more time let me kiss you,
.       G                    C            D7
 Then close your eyes, and I'll be on my way.
.D11  G              C
    dream about the days to come,
.     G                 C
 When I won't have to leave alone,
. G              C               D
 About the times I won't have to say.

;Chorus
.             G     C
 'Cause I'm leavin' on a Jet plane,
.G                  C            D7
  Don't know when I'll be back again.</lyrics>

;Intro x 4 :     G - (D - Dsus4) x 3 - C/G - Cmaj7/G - Am7
;  (Alternating downstroke D-chord and upstroke Dsus4-chord)

.G                    Bm/F#                       C/G
 Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Wierd and Gilly,
.                      D                       G                   Em
 And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand, but made it to far,
.             A                        C/G
 Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band.

.G                   Bm/F#                           C/G
 Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
.                   D                          G
 Like som cat from Japan, he could lick'em by smiling
.                      Em
 He could leave'em to hang
.             A                        C/G
 Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow-white tan.

;Use barre-chords in chorus, play F chord alternating F and F/E
.Am  G              F       Am        G            F
 So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls
.Am        G             F
 Just the beer light to guide us,
.       D                                    E
 So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

;Intro x 2

.G                       Bm/F#                  C/G
 Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
.                   D                 G
 The kids was just crass, he was the nazz
.               Em
 With God given ass
.            A                             C/G
 He took it all too far, but boy could he play guitar.

.Am      G            F       Am    G         F
 Making love with his ego    Ziggy sucked up into his mind
.Am      G      F
 Like a leper messiah
.          D                                E
 When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

;Intro x 4 (with some "oh yeah" and "uuuhh"...)

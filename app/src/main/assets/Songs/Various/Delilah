.Em                                                B     A
 I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window
.Em                                          B    A
 I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind
.E   E7     Am
 She was my woman
.Em                   B                           E   D
 As she betrayed me I watched, and went out of my mind

.G             D
 My, my, my, Delilah
.D                G
 Why, why, why, Delilah
.G       G7       C                    Am
 I could see that girl was no good for me
.G                     D                       G   C
 But I was lost like a slave that no one could free

 At break of day when that man drove away I was waiting
 I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door
 She stood there laughing
 I felt the knife in my hand, and she laughed no more

 My, my, my, Delilah
 Why, why, why, Delilah

 Like before they came to break down the door
 Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take any more

 She stood there laughing
 I felt the knife in my hand, and she laughed no more

 My, my, my, Delilah
 Why, why, why, Delilah

 Like before they came to break down the door
 Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take any more
 Forgive me, Delilah, I just couldn't take any more</lyrics>

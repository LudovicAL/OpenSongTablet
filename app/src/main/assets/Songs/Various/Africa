 Keyboard intro : A  G#m  C#m

.B                    D#m7/Bb     G#m7
   I hear the  drums  echoin'   tonight.
.B/F#           A/E              E/F#        Emaj7/G#
 She hears only whispers of some quiet conversation.
 She's coming in, twelve-thirty flight.
 Moonlight wings reflect the stars
 That guide me toward salvation.
 I stopped an old man along the way,
 Hoping to find some old forgotten words,
 Or ancient melodies.
.B            D#m7/Bb     G#m7
   He turn to me as if to say,
.                  A
 "Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you."

.F#m                  D              A         E
    It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you,
.F#m                       D              A               E
    There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.
.F#m            D             A   E
    I bless the rains down in Africa,
.F#m                D              A               C#m  E   F#m    E/G#     A
    Gonna take some time to do the things we never had.                     

 The wild dogs cry out in the night.
 As they grow restless longing for some solitary company.
 I know that I must do what's right,
 Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti.
 I seem to cure what's deep inside,
 Frightened of this thing that I've become.

 It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you,
 There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.
 I bless the rains down in Africa,
 Gonna take some time to do the things we never had.

 Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you
 It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you.,
 There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.
 I bless the rains down in Africa,
 I bless the rains down in Africa,
 I bless the rains down in Africa,
 I bless the rains down in Africa,
 I bless the rains down in Africa,
 Gonna take some time to do the things we never had.</lyrics>

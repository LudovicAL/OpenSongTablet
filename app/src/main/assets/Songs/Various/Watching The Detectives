;Intro

.Am
 Nice girls, not one with a defect
.F
 Cellophane shrink wrap, so correct
.Am                      F
 Red dogs under illegal legs
.Am                                      F
 She looks so good that he gets down and begs

[C
.       C
 She is watching the detectives
.      G
 "Ooh, he's so cute"
.C
 Watching the detectives
.          G      C      F      D
 When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
.Am                                           G F
 They beat him up until the teardrops start     
.                                          C     G
 But he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart   
[

.Am
 Long shot of that jumping sign
.F
 Visible shivers running down my spine
.Am
 Cut to baby taking off her clothes
.F
 Close up of the sign that says, "We never close"

.Am
 You snatch a tune, you match a cigarette
.F
 She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet
.Am                                     F
 I don't know how much more of this I can take
.Am                                             F
 She's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake  ...

;Chorus

.Am
 You think you're alone, until you realize you're in it
.    F
 Now fear is here to stay, love is here for a visit
.     Am
 They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
.          F
 Someone's scratching at the door, I wonder who is it?
.      Am
 The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
.        F
 Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
.          Am
 Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
.        F                                   C
 It only took my little fingers to blow you away

.          G
 Just like watching the detectives,
.C
 Don't get cute
.G
 Watching the detectives,
.Am                                      G F
 I get so angry when the teardrops start   
.                                          C
 But he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart

;Ending
.G                         Am      F                         Am
 Watching the detectives,          Watching the detectives

 If      you twist and turn away.           
.Asus4   A   Asus4    A       Dsus2  D Dsus2     D
 If      you tear yourself in two again.         
.Asus4  A      Asus4 A
 If I   could, yes I would
.   Dsus2  D    Dsus2D         Asus4  A   Asus4    A
 If I    could, I would let it go.                 
.   Dsus2D  Dsus2  D
 Surren-der,dislocate.
.Asus4    A    Asus4     A      Dsus2    D    Dsus2     D
                                                        
 If I could throw this lifeless life-line to the wind.
 Leave this heart of clay,
 See you walk, walk away, into the night.
 And through the rain.
 Into the half-light,
 And through the flame.

 If I could throw myself, set your spirit free.
 I'd lead your heart away, see you break, break away
 Into the light.
 And to the day.

.A                      D
 Hoo, hoo    Hoo, hoo   Hoo, hoo.
.A                      D
 Hoo, hoo    Hoo, hoo   Hoo, hoo.
.              A          D
 To let it go, And so to fade away.
.              A       D
 To let it go, And so fade away.
.               A
 I'm wide awake.
.              G           E
 I'm wide awake. wide awake,
.Dsus2   Asus4 A   Asus4 A
 I'm not sleeping, oh, no, no.

 If you should ask then maybe
 They tell you what I would say.
 True colors fly in blue and black,
 Bruised silken skies and burning flag.
.A                                   D
 Colors crash, collide in blood shot eyes.
.A                      D
 Hoo, hoo    Hoo, hoo   Hoo, hoo.
 If I could, you know I would.
 If I could, I would let it go.
 This desparation.  Dislocation.
 Separation.  Condemnation.
 Revelation.  Temptation.
 Isolation.  Desolation.

 Let it go, and so to fade away.
 To let it go, and so fade away.
 Oh, no I'm wide awake.
 I'm wide awake.
 I'm not sleeping.  Oh, no no</lyrics>

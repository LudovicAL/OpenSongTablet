[Intro]  manic strumming on D
 then D/F#-D/E-D-D/E (2x)

.D               Em
 Well she was an American girl
.G         A
 Raised on promises
.D                 Em
 She couldn't help thinking that there was
.  G                   A
 A little more to life somewhere else
.                   D
 After all it was a great big world
.G                      Em
 With lots of places to run to
.A
 Yes and if she had to die trying she'd
 that's one real promise she was gonna keep
.G        A
 Oh yeah, allright
.D                  Em
 Take it easy baby, make it last all night
.G        A           D
 She was, an American girl
.D                 Em
 Well it was kinda cold that night
.G                      A
 She stood alone on her balcony
.D                  Em
 She could hear the cars roll by
.       G        A
 Out on 441 like waves crashing on the beach
.                      D
 And for one desperate moment baby
.G                    Em
 He crept back in her memory
.A
 God it's so painful when something is so close
 But still so hard to reach
 G        A</lyrics>

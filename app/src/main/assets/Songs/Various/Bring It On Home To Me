.       G                 D          G        G7         C
 If you ever  change your mind about leaving, leaving me behind
.    G            D                C
 Oh, bring to me, bring your sweet loving
.D                   G   C    G      D
 Bring it on home to me    oh yeah   

.           G                 D              G         G7          C
 You know I laughed  when you left but now I know I've only hurt myself
.   G               D                C
 Oh bring it to me, bring your sweet loving

 I'll give you jewelry, money too, and that's not all, all I do for you

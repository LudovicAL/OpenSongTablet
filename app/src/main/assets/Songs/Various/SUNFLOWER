;Intro

;Listen to the track to get the rythm / strumming pattern of
;the Am and Em on the intro.  The pattern is different for the verses.
;All chords are played in open position unless stated otherwise.

;VERSE 1
.Am           Em
 I don't care how long this lasts
.Am                  Em
 We have no future - we have no past
.C                G
 I write this now while I'm in control
.F                                 Em
 I'll choose the words and how the melody goes -

;VERSE 2
 Along winding streets, we walked hand in hand
 And how I long for that sharp wind. To take my breath away again
 I'd run my fingers  through your hair
 Hair like a wheatfield, I'd run through

 That I'd run through -

;CHORUS
;The same as the intro but there's a bit of distortion on
;lead and there's also a second guitar playing chords.  The
;chords are played in 'A shape'

 And I miss you so - (Oh baby) I miss you so
 Now you're gone, I feel so alone
 (Ooh said) I miss you so

;VERSE 3
 I'd send you a flower - a sunflower bright
 While you cloud my days, messing up my nights
 And all the way up to the top of your head
 Sunshower kisses, I feld we had

;CHORUS

;MIDDLE BIT

;This bit was a bitch to work out. The second time that he plays
;this bit hes got a phasor or flanger on the go.

;There's no garantees about the ending it sounds about right but
;there more than one way to play any tune (right) and when you've
;spent an hour or so listening to the same four second segment of
;song then you kinda get sick of the whole thing.  So if your not
;satisfied with it, play around with it a little yourself</lyrics>

;This one is REALLY easy. Just play:G - C - D - C
;throughout the whole song... except where noted

 Some people call me the space cowboy
 Some call me the gangster of love
 Some people call me Maurice
 'Cause I speak with the prophecies of love

 People talk about me baby
 Say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong
 Don't you worry baby don't worry
 'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home

.G                           C
 'Cause I'm a pitcher, I'm a grinner
.      G               C
 I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
.G         C            D    C
 I play my music in the sun  
.G                  C
 I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
.      G        C
 I'm a midnight talker
.G        C             D     C
 I get my loving on the run   

 Your the cutest thing that I ever did see
 Really like your peaches wanna shake your tree
 Lovy dovy, lovy dovy, lovy dovy all the time
 O wee baby I wanna show you a good time

.G                           C
 'Cause I'm a pitcher, I'm a grinner
.      G               C
 I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
.G         C            D    C
 I play my music in the sun  
.G                  C
 I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
.      G        C
 I'm a midnight talker
.G        C             D     C
 I get my loving on the run</lyrics>

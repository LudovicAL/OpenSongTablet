.Bb     C      F      G       Bb
                              
.A            E
  There was a  time
.F#m            C#m
  When I was so  brokenhearted
.D            A          E
  Love wasn't  much of a  friend of mine
.A                E
  The tables have  turned, yeah
.F#m                  C#m
  'Cause me and those  ways have parted
.D             A             E
  That kind of  love was the  killin' kind
.         G      D            G           D
 (Listen)  All I  want is someone I can't  resist
.C             G                    E
  I know all I  need to know by the  way that I got kissed

.      A              E
 I was  cryin' when I  met you
.        F#m           D
 Now I'm  tryin' to forget you
.A       E         D
 Love is sweet misery
.      A               E
 I was  cryin' just to  get you
.        F#m             D
 Now i'm  dyin' 'cause I  let you
.A            E           D
  Do what you  do down on  me

.Bb     C        F        G
                          
.                                    Bb     C        F        G
 Now there's not even breathin' room                          
.                          Bb     C        F        G
 Between pleasure and pain                          
.                                    Bb     C        F        G
 Yeah you cry when we're makin' love                          
.                    Bb
 Must be one and the  same

 It's down on me
 Yeah I got to tell you one thing
 It's been on my mind
 Girl I gotta say
 We're partners in crime
 You've got that certain something
 What you give to me
 Takes my breath away
 Now the word on the street
 Is the devil's in your kiss
 If our love goes up in flames
 It's a fire I can't resist

 I was cryin' when I met you
 Now I'm tryin' to forget you
 Your love is sweet misery
 I was cryin' just to get you
 Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
 Do what you do to me

 'Cause what you got inside
 Ain't where your love should stay
 Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
 'Til you give your heart away

 I was cryin' when I met you
 Now I'm tryin' to forget you
 Your love is sweet misery
 I was cryin' just to get you
 Now I'm dyin' just to let you
 Do what you do what you do down to me, baby, baby, baby

 I was cryin' when I met you
 Now I'm tryin' to forget you
 Your love is sweet misery
 I was cryin' when I met you
 Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
 Do what you do down to, down to, down to, down to
 I was cryin' when I met you
 Now I'm tryin' to forget you
 Your love is sweet
 I was cryin' when I met you</lyrics>

.G Em D D7 Em

.G       Em              D   D6
   I was dreaming of the past
.D7                         Em   Em#5
   and my heart was beating fast.
.Em6                  D    Dsus D
   I began to lose control,
.Em    Em7             C   C(1) C(2) C(1)
   I began to lose control.

[C]
.G          Dm/F         C   Dsus
   I didn't mean to hurt you,
.G              Dm/FBb           Bb/A
   I'm sorry that I made you cry.
.G          D/F#         Em  Em7
   I didn't mean to hurt you,
.C                    G
   I'm just a jealous guy.
[]

 I was feeling insecure,
 you might not love me anymore.
 I was shivering inside,
 I was shivering inside.

[C]
 I didn't mean to hurt you,
 I'm sorry that I made you cry.
 Oh no, I didn't mean to hurt you,
 I'm just a jealous guy.

;whistle on verse

[C]
 I didn't mean to hurt you,
 I'm sorry that I made you cry.
 Oh no, I didn't mean to hurt you,
 I'm just a jealous guy.
[]

 I was trying to catch your eyes,
 thought that you was trying to hide.
 I was swallowing my pain,
 I was swallowing my pain.

[C]
 I didn't mean to hurt you,
 I'm sorry that I made you cry.
 Oh no, I didn't mean to hurt you,
.C                    G
   I'm just a jealous guy, watch out,
.C                    G
   I'm just a jealous guy, look out, babe,
.C                    G
   I'm just a jealous guy.

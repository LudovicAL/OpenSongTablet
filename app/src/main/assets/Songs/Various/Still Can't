.Am               Fmaj7          G
 Still can't recognise the way I feel I feel I feel
.   Am           Fmaj7      G
 If what you said to me was real
.        Am                   Fmaj7            G
 And you still can't find the strength to apologize, uh-gize, uh-gize, a-lies.
.         Am                  Fmaj7           G
 You just go on laughing and telling everyone lies

.                  Am                 Fmaj7              G
 Cuz you wanted it all, you wanted it all, you wanted it all
.                           Am              Fmaj7           G
 No, and there's nothing at all, nothing at all, nothing at all

.Am                Fmaj7           G
 Baby if you could see beyond your nose, your nose, your nose, who knows?
.Am                   Fmaj7         G
 Back then what could happen surely shows.
.Am              Fmaj7               G
 Do you like the sound than your additude, I do, I do, I do
.        Am                   Fmaj7
 And you went on laughing and shouting, "It's all too soon."

.                  Am                 Fmaj7              G
 Cuz you wanted it all, you wanted it all, you wanted it all
.                           Am              Fmaj7           G
 No, and there's nothing at all, nothing at all, nothing at all

.               Am          Fmaj7             G
 La de da de da de de da da de de de da da da da
.               Am          Fmaj7             G
 La de da de da de de da da de de de da da da da

.Am               Fmaj7          G
 Still can't recognise the way I feel I feel I feel
.   Am           Fmaj7      G
 If what you said to me was real
.        Am                   Fmaj7            G
 And you still can't find the strength to apologize, uh-gize, uh-gize, a-lies.
.         Am                  Fmaj7           G
 You just go on laughing and telling everyone lies

.                  Am                 Fmaj7              G
 Cuz you wanted it all, you wanted it all, you wanted it all
.                           Am              Fmaj7           G
 No, and there's nothing at all, nothing at all, nothing at all

.               Am          Fmaj7             G
 La de da de da de de da da de de de da da da da
.               Am          Fmaj7             G
 La de da de da de de da da de de de da da da da

.          Am             Fmaj7              G
 Wanted it all, wanted it all, you wanted it all
.          Am             Fmaj7              G
 Wanted it all, wanted it all, you wanted it all.

.                   Am Fmaj7 G

 I think this is basically correct:

;Small Faces
;Intro  A   F#m
.A               C#m
  Over bridge of sighs,
.   G               D
 To rest my eyes on shades of green,
.A                C#m
 Under clear blue skies,
.G                        D
 To Itchykoo Park, that's where I've been
;chorus
.             A         G     D
 What did you do there? I got high
.             A            G             D
 What did you touch there? I touched the sky
.            A           G             D
 But why the tears then? I'll tell you why
.A            F#m
 It's all too beautiful (3x)
;bridge
.A                  C
 I fell inclined to blow my mind,
.         G           D            A
 get hung up feed the ducks with a bun
.A                       C                  G            D
 They'll all come out to groove about while I search for fun in the
.E
 sun
;verse
.A                  C#m
 Tell you what I'll do (what will you do?)
.    G                D
 I'd like to go there now with you
.A               C#m
 We can skip out school (won't that be cool)
.    G               D
 Why go to learn the words of fools

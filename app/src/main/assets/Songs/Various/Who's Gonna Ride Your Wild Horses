.        G                       C
 You're dangerous, 'cos you're honest
.        G                                       C
 You're dangerous, 'cos you don't know what you want
.        G                           C
 Well you left my heart empty as a vacant lot
.     G              C
 For any spirit to haunt

. D   C         D       C
 Hey hey sha la la, hey hey

 You're an accident waiting to happen
 You're a piece of glass left there on the beach
 Well you tell me things I know you're not supposed to
 Then you leave me just out of reach

 Hey hey sha la la, hey hey sha la la la

. G           D              C
 Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
. G           D              C
 Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
. G           D              C
 Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
. G           D              C
 Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?

 Well you stole it 'cos I needed the cash
 And you killed it 'cos I needed revenge
 Well you lied to me 'cos I asked you to
 Baby...can we still be friends?

 Hey hey sha la la, hey hey sha la la la

 Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
 Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
 Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
 Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee?

.Am    Em
 The deeper I spin
.G                                 D
 The hunter will sin ... for your ivory skin
.Am
 Took a drive in the dirty rain
.Em
 To a place where the wind calls your name
.G
 Under the trees the river laughing
.D
 At you and me...
.Am
 Hallelujah, heavens white rose
.F                     D
 The doors you open I just can't close

.           G         D              C
 Don't you turn around, don't you turn around again
.           G         D              C
 Don't you turn around your gypsy heart
 Don't turn around, don't turn around again
 Don't turn around, and don't look back

.        C        D
 Come on now love, don't you look back

 Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
 Who's gonna drown in your blue sea?
 Who's gonna taste your salt water kisses?
 Who's gonna take the place of me?
 Who's gonna ride your wild horses?
 Who could tame the heart of thee?</lyrics>

.C           F            G7              C
 Trailer for sale or rent,   rooms to let fifty cents
.C            F               G                G7
 No phone, no pool, no pets ... I ain't got no cigarettes
.           C             F
 Ah, but ... two hours of pushin' broom
.       G7              C
 Buys a eight-by-twelve four-bit room
.        C7       F                   G7              C
 I'm a ... man of means, by no means .... King of the Road

 Third boxcar, midnight train, destination Bangor, Maine
 Old worn-out suit and shoes, I don't pay no union dues
 I smoke ... old stogies I have found
 Short, but not too big around
 I'm a ... man of means, by no means ... King of the Road

;Bridge:
.       C                 F
 I know every engineer on every train
.G7                         C
 All of their children, and all of their names
.    C                F
 And every handout in every town
.    G                                  G7
 And every lock that ain't locked, when no one's around, I sing ...

.Bb   F    Bb   F
                
.Gm                                                           F
 Didn't know what time is was, and the lights were low - ow - ow -
.                                C
 I leaned back on my radio - o - o -
.                              C7                             F    Ab Bb
 Some cat was laying down some rock'n'roll, "lotta soul", he said.  
.Gm                                        F
 Then the loud sound did seem to fa - a - ade,
.                                                    C
 Came back like a slow voice on a wave of pha - a - ase,
.                               C7                  A   G
 That weren't no D.J., that was hazy cosmic jive.       

[C
.           F       Dm                       Am               C
 There's a starman waiting in the sky, he'd like to come and meet us,
.         C7                                   F       Dm
 but he thinks he'd blow our minds, There's a starman waiting in the sky,
.      Am             C                  C7
 he's told us not to blow it, 'cause he knows it's all worth-while,
.           Bb        Bbm             F         D7
 he told me, let the children lose it, let the children use it,
.Gm            C7
  let all the children boogie.

 I had to phone someone, so I picked on you - ou - ou -
 Hey, that's far out, so you heard tim too - oo - oo -
 Switch on the T.V., we may pick him on channel two.
 Look out your window, I can see his ligh - igh - ight,
 if we can sparkle he may land tonigh - igh - ight,
 Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright.

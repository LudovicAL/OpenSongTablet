 You know I love you
 You know it's true
 Give you all my love babe
 What, can I do

;Chorus
 I'm walking, by my self
 I hope you understand
 I just want to be your lovin' man

;Chorus
 I'm walking, by my self
 I hope you understand
 I just want to be your lovin'
 I just want to be your lovin'
 I just want to be your lovin' man</lyrics>

 I'm  tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.

 Well, I  feel like this when my  baby can't be  found. 

.  C                  C
 I  went to the river  to jump in.
.   C
 My  baby showed up and said, "I will tell you when."

.          F                                     C        lick
 Well, I'm  tore down, I'm almost level with the  ground.

 Well, I  feel like this when my  baby can't be  found.

 I  love you babe with all my  heart and soul;
.C                    C
  Love like mine will  never grow old.
.C                                   C
  Love you in the morning and in the  evening too.
.C
  Every time you leave me I get mad with you.

 I  love you baby with  all my might;
.C                  C
  Love like mine is  out of sight.
.     C                   C
 I'll  lie for you if you  want me too.
.  C
 I  really don't believe that your love is true.

;Chorus

 I'm  tore down, I'm almost level with the ground.

 Well, I  feel like this when my  baby can't be  found.</lyrics>

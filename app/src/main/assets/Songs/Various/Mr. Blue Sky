  <lyrics>[V1]
.F                                        Em7   A  Dm
 Sun is shinin' in the sky, there ain't a cloud in sight
.             G             Em          A
 It's stopped rainin', everybody's in a play
.              Bb                         F        Bb
 And don't you know, it's a beautiful new day, hey hey

[V2]
 Runnin' down the avenue, see how the sun shines brightly
 In the city on the streets where once was pity,
 Mr. Blue Sky is living here today.

[Chorus]
.Dm       F                   Bb              F
 Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why, you had to hide away
.    Gm      F               Eb          Bb
 For so long       where did we go wrong.

[V3]
 Hey there Mr. Blue, we're so pleased to be with you
 Look around see what you do, everybody smiles at you.

[V4]
 Hey you with the pretty face, welcome to the human race
 A celebration Mr. Blue Sky's up there waitin' and today
 Is the day we've waited for

;Chorus

[B]
.F                                         Em7   A   Dm
 Mr. Blue you did it right, but soon comes Mis - ter Night,
.         G             Em                A
 Creepin' over, now his hand is on your shoulder,
.      Bb                     Db          Eb              Dm
 Never mind I'll remember you this I'll remember you this way.

[Outro]

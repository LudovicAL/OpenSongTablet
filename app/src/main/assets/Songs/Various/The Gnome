;(From "The Piper Before The Gates Of Dawn")

.   D       A         D
 I want to tell you a story
.         C      A   C     A
 About a little man, if I can.
.   D            A      D
 A gnome named Grimble Grumble.
.     C       A         C         A
 And little gnomes stay in their homes.
.G  D      F  A      F  A          D
 Eating, sleeping, drinking their wine.

 He wore a scarlet tunic,
 A blue green hood,
 It looked quite good.
 He had a big adventure
 Amidst the grass
 Fresh air at last.
 Wining, dining, biding his time.

.G                C     F
 And then one day - hooray!
.  A      A        G        D
 Another way for gnomes to say
. G         D
 Hoooooooooray.

 Look at the sky, look at the river
 Isn't it good?
 Look at the sky, look at the river
 Isn't it good?
 Winding, finding places to go.

 And then one day - hooray!
 Another way for gnomes to say
 Hoooooooooray.
 Hooooooooooooooray.</lyrics>

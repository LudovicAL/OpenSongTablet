.E                       B                             E
 Here I am again in this mean old town and your so far away from me
.                           B                            E
 Now where are you when the sun gos down and your so far away from me
.A       C#m         B         E
 So far away from me, so far I just can't see
.A       C#m         B        A        E B A E
 So far away from me, just so far from me

 I'm tired of bein in love and bein all alone when your so far away from me
 I'm tired of makin out on the telephone cus your so far away from me
 So far away from me, so far I just can't see
 So far away from me, just so far from me

 And I get so tired when I have to explain your so far away from me
 See you be in the sun and I be in the rain and your so far away from me
 So far away from me, so far I just can't see
 So far away from me, just so far from me</lyrics>

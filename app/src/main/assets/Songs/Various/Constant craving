.Em  D               C       C
 E - ven through the darkest phase
.Em D           C   C
 Be it thick or thin
.Em D          C        C
 Always someone marches brave
.Em     D        C
 Here beneath my skin

.    Em7  D     D  Em
 And constant craving
.    Em7  Dm7  Em  Em
 Has al - ways been

.Em  D         C      C
 Maybe a great magnet pulls
.Em  D             C    C
 All souls towards truth
.Em D           C    C
 Or maybe it is life itself
.Em   D               C   C
 That feeds wisdom to its youth

.    Em7  D     D  Em
 And constant craving
.    Em7  Dm7  Em  Em
 Has al - ways been

 Has al - ways been

 Has al - ways been

.    Em7  D     D  Em
 And constant craving
.    Em7  Dm7  Em  Em
 Has al - ways been
.    Em7  D     D  Em
 And constant craving
.    Em7  Dm7  G   G
 Has al - ways been

 Craving

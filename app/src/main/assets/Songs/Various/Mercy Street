.Dbm                            E/Db
 Looking down on empty streets, all she can see
.        Gbm/A                          Gbm
 Are the dreams all made solid, are the dreams made real
.Dbm                   E/Db
 All of the buildings, all of the cars
.     Gbm/A                E/Db
 Were once just a dream in somebody's head
.    Dbm                        E/Db
 She pictures the broken glass, pictures the steam
.    A                    A/Gb
 She pictures a soul with no leak at the seam

.Dbm
 Let's take the boat out (wait until darkness)
.Dbm
 Let's take the boat out (wait until darkness comes)

 Nowhere in the corridors of pale green and grey
 Nowhere in the suburbs, in the cold light of day
 There in the midst of it so alive and alone
.A                  B
 Words support like bone

;chorus
[C]
.            E/Db A  B       Dbm         Abm/B A9
 Dreaming of Mer--cy Street, wear your inside  out
.            E     A B         Dbm          B
 Dreaming of mercy     in your daddy's arms again
.            E/Db A  B       Dbm              Abm/B A9
 Dreaming of Mer--cy Street, swear they moved that  sign
.            E     A B         Dbm
 Dreaming of mercy     in your daddy's arms

;solo
.E/Db A E/Db A Dbm
           
 Pulling out the papers from the drawers that slide smooth
 Tugging at the darkness, word upon word
 Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
 To the priest-he's the doctor, he can handle the shocks
 Dreaming of the tenderness-the tremble in the hips
.   A              B
 Of kissing Mary's lips

;chorus
;repeat solo

.Dbm
 Mercy, mercy looking for mercy
.Dbm    B              Db     B
 Mercy,    looking for mercy  
.            Dbm    A
 Looking for mercy  
.            Dbm
 Looking for mercy...

.Dbm                     E/Db
 Anne with her father is out in the boat
.Gbm/A              Gbm                     Dbm
 Riding the water,  riding the waves on the sea</lyrics>

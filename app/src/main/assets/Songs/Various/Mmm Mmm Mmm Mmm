;Intro:
.Gm   Dm   Gm   Dm
                
.G#   A#   G#   A#
                

.Cm   A#             D#
 Once there was this kid who
.G#          D#           A#               D#
 got into an accident and couldn't come to school, but
.G#              A#   D#
 when he finally came back
.A#  D#   G#              D#       A#
 his hair had turned from black into bright white
.   B                A#            B                   G#
 He said that it was from when the cars smashed soooo hard...

.Gm      Dm
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm         (x2)

.G#   A#   G#   A#
                
.Cm   A#             D#
 Once there was this girl who
.G#              D#              A#           D#
 wouldn't go and change with the girls in the changeroom
.    G#                A#   D#
 and when they finally made her,
.A#   D#  G#             D#       A#
 they saw birthmarks all over her body
.   B                A#          B                G#
 She couldn't quite explain it they'd always just been there

.Gm      Dm
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm (x2)

.G#   A#   G#   A#
                 (x2)

.Gm      Dm
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm (x2)

.G#   A#   G#   A#
                 (x2)
.Fm                D#      A#
 But both girl and boy where glad,
.Fm                  D#       A#
 this one kid had it worse than that

.G#

.     Cm   A#               D#
 Cause then, there was this boy whose
.G#               D#            A#               D#
 parents made him come directly home right after school,
.         G#                A#    D#
 and then when they went to their church,
.A#    D#    G#              D#       A#
 their shock had leashed all over the churchfloor
.   B                A#            B             G#
 He couldn't quite explain that they always just gone there...

.Gm      Dm
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm         (x2)

.G#   A#   G#   A#
                
.Gm      Dm
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm         (x2)

.G#   A#   G#   A#
                
.Fm            D#   A#
                    
.Fm            D#   A#

[Intro]  Em  G  D  C    G   D  Cmaj7 /

.Em     G
 This flower is scorched
.       D
 This film is on
.C                G
 On a maddening look
.          D  Cmaj7
 These clothes
.       Em                       G
 These clothes don't fit us right
. D      C
 I'm to blame
.       G         D
 It's all the same
.              Cmaj7
 It's all the same

 You come to me with a bone in your hand
 You come to me with your hair curled tight
 You come to me with positions
 You come to me with excuses
 Ducked out in a row
 You wear me out, You wear me out
 We've been through faith breakdown
 Self hurt
 Plastics collections
 Self help self pain EST
 Psychics fuck off
 I was central
 I had control
 I lost my head
 I need this
 I need this
 A paper weight junk garage
 Winter rain a honey pot
 Crazy, all the lovers have been tagged
 Hotline wanted ad
 Crazy what you could have had
 It's crazy what you could have had
 It's crazy what you could have had
 I need this
 I need this</lyrics>

.      E
 I was thinking 'bout parking the other night
.G       A        E
  we was out on a back road
.E
 me and my woman was just gettin' right
.    G          A   E
 all systems on overload
.E
 Radio blastin' in the front seat
.G               A     E
 turning out the music fine
.E
 we was snuggled up in the back seat
.G             A    E
 making up for lost time

[C
.E                  G     A    E
 Steamy windows, zero visibility
.E               G               A    E
 Steamy windows, coming from the body heat
[

.        E
 You can wine and dine with a woman all night
.G     A      E
  with good intent
.            E
 but there's something about a confrontation on a back road
.G        A        E
   breaks down the defense

;Chorus

;Solo over verse progression

.          E
 There's a sound outside the front door
.      G         A        E
 and I know it's just the wind
.       E
 but it makes her snuggle up just a little bit closer
.       G             A          E
 and it starts things happening again

.E               G       A        E
 Steamy windows, ain't nobody can see
 Steamy windows, coming from the body heat
 Steamy windows, zero visibility
 Steamy windows, coming from the body heat
.       E               E
 Steamy windows, steamy windows</lyrics>

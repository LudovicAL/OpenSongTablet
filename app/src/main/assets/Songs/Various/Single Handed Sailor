;Intro:
.Dm C  G
       

.Dm                C       Bb        F
   It's two in the morning dry dock town
.Dm             C               Bb F
   River on the way in the night 
.Dm           C                Bb        F
   Little Gypsy Moth -- she's all tied down
.Dm              C                      Bb F
   She quiver in the wind and the lights 

 Yes, and the sailing ship, she's just all held down in chains
 From the lazy days of sailing
 She's just lying there in silent pain
 he is lean on the tourist rail...

.Am                               Dm           DmC Bb
   A mother and her baby and the college of war    
.                 C
 In the concrete gray
.Dm                  C         Bb       F
   You never want to fight the river law
.Gm                  Bb
   Nobody rules the waves!

.            C             A7           Dm
 And on the night when the lazy wind is wailing
.Bb                 C
   Around the Cutty Surk
. Dm            C     Bb      F
 Single-handed sailor go sailing
.Gm                        Bb
   Sailing away in the dark...

 He's upon the bridge of the self same night
 A mariner of dry dock land
 Two in the morning, there's one green light
 And a man on the barge of sand

 She's gonna slip away below him
 Away from things he's done
 he's just shout, "Hey man, what you call this thing?"
 He could have said, "Pride of London"

.            C             A7           Dm
 And on the night when the lazy wind is wailing
.Bb                 C
   Around the Cutty Surk
. Dm            C     Bb      F
 Single-handed sailor go sailing
.Gm                        Bb
   Sailing away in the dark...</lyrics>

.Am7         Gm7       Am7         Gm7       Am7      Gm7      Am7           Gm7
 Well it's a marvelous night for a moondance with the stars up above in your eyes
.Am7  Gm7      Am7           Gm7     Am7         Gm7      Am7     Gm7
 A fantabulous night to make romance beneath the cover of October skies
.Am7     Gm7           Am7       Gm7     Am7    Gm7          Am7          Gm7
 All the leaves of the trees are falling to the sound of the breezes that blow
.Am7          Gm7       Am7          Gm7     Am7     Gm7                Am7           Gm7
 You know I'm tryin' to plead to the calling of your heart strings that play soft and low

;Chorus
.Gm7          Cm7     Gm7            Cm7         Gm7
 You know the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
.Gm7          Cm7  Gm7                Cm7           D
 You know the soft moonlight seems to shine on your blush
.    Gm7    Cm7      Gm7      Cm7        Gm7    Cm7    Gm7   Cm7
 Can I just have one more moondance with you           my    love
.    Gm7    Cm7       Gm7    Cm7        Gm7     Cm7        Gm7   Cm7     D
 Can I just make some more romance with you                my    love    

.Am7    Gm7        Am7         Gm7     Am7     Gm7           Am7        Gm7
 Well I wanna make love to you tonight I can't wait till the moment has come
.Am7        Gm7           Am7          Gm7   Am7          Gm7     Am7           Gm7
 Yeah and I know that the time is just right and straight into my arms you will run
.Am7      Gm7     Am7           Gm7     Am7     Gm7              Gm7     Am7
 When you come my heart will be waiting to make sure that you're never alone
.Am7       Gm7         Am7              Gm7       Am7       Gm7         Am7         Gm7
 There and then all my dreams will come true dear there and then I will make you my own

.      Cm7    Gm7                 Cm7       Gm7
 Every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
.       Cm7      Gm7              Cm7            D
 Then I know how much you want me that you can't hide
.    Gm7    Cm7      Gm7      Cm7        Gm7    Cm7    Gm7   Cm7
 Can I just have one more moondance with you           my    love
.    Gm7    Cm7       Gm7    Cm7        Gm7     Cm7        Gm7   Cm7     D
 Can I just make some more romance with you                my    love

 My girl Friday she no square
 She like lotus blossom in her hair
 Be-bop records and something new
 Sometimes borrowed but she's never blue
.A#     G#  F      A#   D#
    Oh no... not Tokyo Joe

 Way past midnight - she not home
 She cut the ice down the Danger Zone
 Watertight dresses - she don't care
 A trifle risqu, a tart, no sir...
 Oh no... sounds like Tokyo Joe

 Geisha girl show you she adore you
. C#    F#     D#     G#
 Two oriental eyes implore you
.  D#              G#
 Femme fatal or ingenue?
. C#        F#        D#      G#
 She very cunning, fiendish clever
. C#           F#    D#    G#     D#
 Geisha girl suffer many times a fool

 Sayonara moon

 When all the world's a stage, oh where are you? 

 Tokyo Rose on the radio
 Or Diz'n Bird puttin' on the moan
 Tappin' our telexes to Tupelo
 Dear John, doh ra me fah so?
 Let's go... call for Tokyo Joe

 Walkin' tall down the Danger Zone
 She hokey-kokey till the cows come home
 Big shot - from the hip - neon cool
 Say, when you've been around, what's left to do?
 Don't know? Ask Tokyo Joe

 So inscrutable her reply
 "Ask no question and me tell no lie"
 GI boys howlin' out for more
 VIP'S purrin' "je t'adore"...
 Ah so... that's Tokyo Joe</lyrics>

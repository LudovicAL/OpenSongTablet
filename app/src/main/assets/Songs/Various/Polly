 Polly wants a cracker
 Maybe she would like some food
 She asked me to untie her
 A chase would be nice for a few

;repeat chorus

 Polly said

 Polly says her back hurts
 And she's just as bored as me
 She caught me off my guard
 It amazes me, the will of instinct

;repeat chorus; end on Em</lyrics>

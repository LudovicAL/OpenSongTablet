;Felder, Henley &amp; Frey
.Bm                        F#
 On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
.A                      E
 Warm smell of colitas, rising through the air
.G                         D
 Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimering light
.Em                                        F#
 My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night

.Bm                              F#
 There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
.A                                           E
 And I was thinking to myself: this could be heaven or this could be hell
.G                        D
 Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
.Em                                   F#
 There were voices down the corridor; I thought I heard them say:

[C]
. G                           D
 "Welcome to the Hotel California
.F#                                                Bm
 Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
.G                                  D
 Plenty of room at the Hotel California
.    Em                                       F#
 Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here"

.Bm                           F#
 Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
.A                                     E
 She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
.G                                D
 How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
.Em                      F#
 Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

.Bm                           F#
 So I called up the captain, "Please bring me my wine", He said
.A                                      E
 "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine"
.G                                       D
 And still those voices are calling from far away
.Em                                      F#
 Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say:

. G                           D
 "Welcome to the Hotel California
.F#                                                Bm
 Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
.     G                                D
 They livin' it up at the Hotel California
.       Em                                               F#
 What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis"

.Bm                      F#
 Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice, and she said
. A                               E
 "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
.G                             D
 And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
.Em                                             F#
 They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast

.Bm                           F#
 Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
.A                                     E
 I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
. G                                   D
 "Relax," said the night man, "We are programmed to receive
.Em                                       F#
 You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"

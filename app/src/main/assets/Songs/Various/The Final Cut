.F                                          F/C   C
 Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes____
.      Bbadd9                                    F
 I can barely define the shape of this moment in time.
.    F                                  F/C   C
 And far from flying high in clear blue skies___,
.    Bbadd9                                            F
 I'm spiralling down to the hole in the ground where I hide.

.Bb                   F
 If you negotiate the minefield in the drive,
.Bb                                   F
 And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes,
.Bb         C                    Dm
 And if you make it past the shotgun in the hall,
.Gm7
 Dial the combination, open the priesthole
.                   /C                              F
 And if I'm in I'll tell you what's behind the wall.

.Am                                   F
 There's a kid who had a big hallucination
.Am                          C
 Making love to girls in magazines.
.   Bb                                   Dm
 He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith.
.Gm7
 Could anybody love him
.                /C          F      F/C  C  Bbadd9  F
 Or is it just a crazy dream___?                    

.    F                     C
 And if I show you my dark side
.                    Bb   F
 Will you still hold me tonight?
.    F            C
 And if I open my heart to you
.                     Bb
 And show you my weak side,
.               F
 What would you do?
.Bb                                   F
 Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
.Bb
 Would you take the children away
.F
 And leave me alone?
.    Bb           C
 And smile in reassurance
.       Dm
 As you whisper down the phone,
.Gm7
 Would you send me packing,
./C                   F
 Or would you take me home?

.Am  F  Am  C  Bb  Dm  Gm7 /C F
                              

.Am                                 F
 Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings,
.Am                                C
 Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.
.  Bb
 I held the blade in trembling hands,
.   Dm                   Gm7
 Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang,
.                                        G      C  Bbadd9  F
 I never had the nerve to make the final cut.</lyrics>

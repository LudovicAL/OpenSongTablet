.D  F  A7sus4 G  D  F  A7sus4
                       

.D              F               A7sus4      G
 Hey now little speedy head the read on the speedometer says
.D                  F           A7sus4
 you have to go the task in the city
.D                      F
 Where people drown and people serve
.A7sus4             G               D         F              A7sus4
 Don't be shy, your just deserve is only just light years to go

.G                  A                  D               Em
 Me my thoughts are flowers strewn, an ocean storm may bury them
.G             A                D  Dsus
 I have got to leave to find my way
.G                  A             D                Em
 Watch the road and memorize this life that passed before my eyes
.    G          A        D
 and nothing is going my way

.D  F  A7sus4  G  D  F  A7sus4
                        

.D                F                 A7sus4            G
 The ocean is the river's goal, the need to leave the water knows
.D                     F             A7sus4
 We're closer now, but light years to go
.G             A                D            Em
 I have got to find the river,  Bergamot and bed of rose
.G              A            D
 Run through my head and far away
.G                  A             D                Em
 Leave the road and memorize this life that passed before my eyes
.    G          A        D
 and nothing is going my way

.D                      F                  A7sus4            G
 There's no one left to take the lead, but I'll tell you and you can see
.D                    F              A7sus4
 We're closer now and light years to go
.D                F               A7sus4        G
 Pick up here and chase the ride, river empties to the tide
.D    F        A7sus4
 Fall into the ocean

.G            A            D               Em
 River to the ocean goes a fortune for the undertow
.G               A        D
 None of this is going my way
.G                A                D                 Em
 There is nothing left to grow but ginger, mint, and indigo
.G                  A       D
 Coriander stem and rows of hay
.G                    A                D              Em
 Strength and courage overrides, these privileged and weary eye
.G           A      D
 River poets search naivete
.G                A                   D             Em
 Pick up here and chase the ride, the river empties to the tide
.G              A           D
 All of this is coming your way

.     F                   C
 Hey, Jude, don't make it bad,
.       C7sus        C7      F
 Take a sad song and make it better.
.  Bb                          F
 Remember to let her into your heart,
.             C7               F
 Then you can start to make it better.

.     F              C
 Hey, Jude, don't be afraid,
.         C7sus      C7      F
 You were made to go out and get her.
.    Bb                            F
 The minute you let her under your skin,
.           C7             F
 Then you begin to make it better.

.F7                       Bb
 And anytime you feel the pain,
.             Gm7
 Hey, Jude, refrain,
.                C7              F
 Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
.         F7       C7
 Da da da da da da da da da da.

.     F                  C
 Hey, Jude, don't let me down,
.         C7sus          C7     F
 You have found her, now go and get her.
.  Bb                          F

.             C7               F
 Then you can start to make it better.

.F7                           Bb
 For now you know that it's a fool
.             Gm7
 Who plays it cool
.              C7             F
 By making his world a little colder.
.         F7       C7
 Da da da da da da da da da da.

.     F                   C
 Hey, Jude, don't make it bad,
.       C7sus        C7      F
 Take a sad song and make it better.
.  Bb                          F
 Remember to let her into your heart,
.             C7               F
 Then you can start to make it better.</lyrics>

.G          Em    Am          D7
 Don't know when I've been so blue
.G          Em     F#m       B
 Don't know what's come over you
.Em        G       A
 You found someone new
.    C                Bm         C
 Now don't it make my brown eyes blue

.G       Em   Am          D
 I'll be fine when you're gone
.G         Em  F#m       B
 I'll just cry all night long
.Em     G     A
 Say it isn't true
.C                    C          G
 And don't it make my brown eyes blue
.Em         Bm      C            G
 Tell me no secrets tell me some lies
.Em         Bm           C     G
 Give me no reasons give me alibies
.Em          Bm          C            G
 Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
.Am       Bm      C         C
 Say anything but don't say goodbye

.G        Em       Am       D
 I didn't mean to treat you bad
.F      Em        F#m    B
 Didn't know just what I had
.Em         G     A
 But honey now I do
.C                    Bm
 And don't it make my brown eyes
.C                Bm
 Don't it make my brown eyes
.C                C          G
 Don't it make my brown eyes blue</lyrics>

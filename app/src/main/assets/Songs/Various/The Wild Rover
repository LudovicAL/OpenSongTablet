.     G                               C
 I've been the wild rover for many a year
.G             D       D7             G
 spent all my money on whiskey and beer
.                                      C
 but now I'm returning with gold in restore
.G             D          D7        G
 never I'll play the wild rover no more.

;Chorus
[C
.         D         D7
 And it's no nay never
.G                C
 no nay never no more
.       G                 C
 will I play the wild rover
.  D7          G
 nonever no more
[

 I went to a chanty I used to frequent
 Told the landlady my money was spent
 I asked for her credit she answered me nay
 saying customers like you I can get any day.

;Chorus

 I drew from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
 The landlady's eyes opened wide in delight
 saying I have the whiskey and wine of the best
 and the words that I told you were only in jest.

;Chorus

 I'll go home to my parents confess what I've done
 and ask them to pardon their prodigal son
 and if they do as so often before
 then I never Shall play the wild rover no more.

 Dennis is a menace with his 'anyone for tennis?'
.        Dm                              F7
 and beseeching me to come and keep the score.
.     Hb                      Hbm
 And Maud say 'Oh Lord, I'm so terribly bored.
.  F             Dm      G7/D   C7
 I really can't stand it anymore.'
.          F                     A7
 I'm going out to dinner with a gorgeous singer
.      Dm                              F7
 to a little place I found down by the quay

 her name is Patricia, she calls herself Delicia
.        F           Dm            G9
 and the reason isn't very hard to see.

.C7        F                                  A7
 She says 'God made her a sinner just to keep fat man thinner
.        Dm                               F7
 as they tumble down in heaps before her feet.
.      Hb                         Hbm
 They hang around in groups like battle weary troops
.          F             Dm                    G9
 one can often see them queue right down the street.
.C7         Hb                      A7
 You see Patricia (or Delicia) not only is a singer
.     Dm                      G7   C7
 she also removes all her clothing for
.  Hb                 C                    F   Hb  F
 Patricia is the best   stripper in town.          

.F    C7     F                      D7
  And with a swing of her hips she started to strip
.      Gm                    C7
 to tremendous applause she took of her drawers
.            F                        D7
 and with a lick of her lips she undid all her clips
.              Dm                 C
 and threw it all in the air - ev'rybody stared
.           Hb                         A7
 and as the last piece of clothing fell on the floor
.          F                        D7
 the police were banging on the door
.       Gm               C              F     Hb
 on a saturday night in nineteen-twentyfour.  
.          F         C7
 Take it away boys.

 But poor Patricia was arrested and everyone detested
.    Dm                             F7
 the manner in which she was exposed
.Hb                     Hbm
 later on in court well everybody thought
.     F             Dm                 G9
 a summer run in jail would be proposed.
.C7         Hb                     A7
 But the judge said 'Patricia, or may I say Delicia,
.     Dm                           G7 C7
 the facts of this case lie before me case dismissed

 this girl was in her working clothes.         

 And with a swing of her hips...
.           Hb                         A7
 and as the last piece of clothing fell on the floor
.          F                        D7
 the police were yelling at the door

 on a saturday night in nineteen-twentyfour -

 on a saturday night in nineteen-twentyfour.

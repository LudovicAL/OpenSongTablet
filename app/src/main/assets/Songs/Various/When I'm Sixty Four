.C                                                    G7
 When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now
.G7                                                                     C
 Will you still be sending me a valentine, birthday greeting, bottle of wine?
.C                                       C7                     F
 If I'd been out 'till quarter to three, would you lock the door?
.               Ab7      C/G                A7
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
.D9       G7/6  C           Am        G         Am
 When I'm sixty four?                           

.C                                                           G7
 I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone
.G7                                                               C
 You can knit a sweater by the fireside, sunday morning, go for a ride
.C                                    C7                    F
 Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
.               Ab7      C/G                A7
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
.D9       G7/6  C
 When I'm sixty four?

.Am                                                       G                   Am
 Every summer we can rent a cottage at the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
.                    E
 We shall scrimp and save
.Am             Dm           F     G         C
 Grand children on your knee Vera, Chuck and Dave

.C                                                        G7
 Send me a postcard, drop me a line, stating point of view
.G7                                                               C
 Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away
.C                                  C7                F
 Give me an answer, fill in a form, mine for ever more
.               Ab7      C/G                A7
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
.D9       G7/6  C
 When I'm sixty four? Ho!

.                 E     Am              Dm            F       G         C       G
 You'll be older, too, (ah!) and if you say the word, I could stay with you

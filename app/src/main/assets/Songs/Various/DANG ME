.D                 G
 HERE I SIT HIGH GETTIN IDEAS
.        A                  D
 AIN'T NOTHIN BUT A FOOL'D LIVE LIKE THIS
.                G
 OUT ALL NIGHT RUNNIN WILD
.A
 WOMAN SITTIN HOME WITH A MONTH OLD CHILD

.D       G
 DANG ME DANG ME
.        A                         D
 THEY OUGHT TO TAKE AND ROPE AND HANG ME
.                        G
 HIGH FROM THE HIGHEST TREE  (WHOOP WHOOP, ETC.)
.  A                       D
 WOMAN WOULD YOU WEEP FOR ME

 DANG ME

 SAT AROUND DRINKIN WITH THE REST OF THE GUYS
 SIX ROUNDS BOUGHT AND I BOUGHT FIVE
 SPENT THE GROCERIES AND HALF THE RENT
 LIKE FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND TWENTY SEVEN CENTS

 DANG ME

 ROSES ARE READ VIOLETS ARE PURPLE
 SUGAR IS SWEET AND SO IS MAPLE SYRPLE
 NOW I'M THE SEVENTH OUT OF SEVEN SONS
 MY PAPPY WAS A PISTOL I,M A SONG OF A GUN</lyrics>

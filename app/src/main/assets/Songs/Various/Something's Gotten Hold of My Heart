;INTRO:
.CGEm D
    
.Gm                            F
 Something's gotten hold of my heart
.           Eb          D7      Gm
 Keeping my soul and my senses apart
.                           F
 Something's gotten into my life
.             Eb             D7            Gm
 Cutting it's way through my dreams like a knife
.F          Eb      D7         Gm
 Turning me up, and turning me down
.F         Eb         D7        Gm
 Making me smile, and making me frown

.Gm                  F
 In a world that was small
.                  Bb7           Eb           D7          Gm
 I once lived in a time that was peace and no troubles at all
.                     F
 But then you came my way
.                     Gm             F
 And a feeling (of) unknown shook my heart,
.        C7          F
 made me want you to stay
.C7        F           C7        Eb
 All of my nights, and all of my days

.D7
  (yeah I gotta tell you now)
.Gm                            F
 Something's gotten hold of my hand
.            Eb        D7        Gm
 Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
.                               F
 Yeah, something has invaded my night
.            Eb           D7        Gm
 Painting my sleep with a colour so bright
.F            Eb        D7           Gm
 Changing the grey, and changing the blue
.F           Eb      D7          G
 Scarlet for me, and scarlet for you

.CGEm A
    

;Bridge
.  A7
 I got to know if this is the real thing
.  A9
 I got to know it's making my heart sing
.       D              D9
 Wo-hoo-o-ye-e-e-e-e e-
.    D7
 You smile and I am lost for a lifetime
.     D9                           D7
 Each minute spent with you is the right time
 Every hour, every day
 You touch me and my mind goes astray, yeah
 Baby, baby

.Gm                            F
 Something's gotten hold of my hand
.            Eb        D7        Gm
 Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
.                         F
 Something has invaded my night
.            Eb           D7        Gm
 Painting my sleep with a colour so bright
.F            Eb        D7           Gm
 Changing the grey, and changing the blue
.F           Eb      D7          Gm
 Scarlet for me, and scarlet for you</lyrics>

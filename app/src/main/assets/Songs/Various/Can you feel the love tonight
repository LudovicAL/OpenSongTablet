;Verse
.F                    C
 There's a calm surrender
.F               C
 To the rush of day
.F                       C
 When the heat of the rolling world
.Dm              G
 Can be turned away

 An enchanted moment
 And it sees me through
 It's enough for this restless warrior
 Just to be with you

 There's a time for everyone
 If they only learn
 That the twisting kaleidoscope
 Moves us all in turn

 There's a rhyme and reason
 To the wild outdoors
 When the heart of the star-crossed voyager
 Beats in time with yours

;Chorus:
.C           G           Am  F
 And can you feel the love tonight
.C               G
 It is where we are
.F                 G                 Am
 It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
.Dm          G               C
 That we've got this far     

 And can you feel the love tonight
 How it's laid to rest
 It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
 Believe the very best

;Chorus

 It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
 Believe the very best</lyrics>

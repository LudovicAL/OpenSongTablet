 In Europe and America
.          Fm      Gm            Ab   Bb
 There's a growing feeling of hysteria
.   Cm            Cm/Bb    Ab             Bb
 Conditioned to respond to all the threats
.          G/B           Cm        G7sus  G
 In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets
.       Eb                    G/B
 Mister Krushev said "We will bury you"
.  Cm                      G
 I don't subscribe to this point of view
.        Cm      Cm/Bb    Ab       Bb
 It'd be such an ignorant thing to do
.       Fm7                 Bb       Cm
 If the Russians love their children too

 How can I save my little boy
 From Oppenheimers deadly toy
 There is no monopoly on common sense
 On either side of the political fence
 We share the same biology
 Regardless of ideology
 Believe me when I say to you
.  Fm       Gm       Ab         Bb       Cm
 I hope the Russians love their children too

 There is no historical precedent
 To put the words in the mouth of the president
 There's no such thing as a winnable war
 It's a lie we don't believe anymore
 Mister Reagan says "We will protect you"
 I don't subscribe to that point of view
 Believe me when I say to you
 I hope the Russians love their children too

 We share the same biology
 Regardless of ideology
 But what might save us, me and you
.          Fm       Gm   Ab    Bb       Cm
 Is if the Russians love their children too</lyrics>

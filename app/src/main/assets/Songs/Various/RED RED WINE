.D         G     C   Am             G
 Red,red wine,           go to my head
.C         G            C                 G
 Make me forget that I     still need her so

.D         G     C   Am             G
 Red,red wine           it's up to you
.C         G             C                    G
 All I can do, I've done;  but memories won't go
.C                  G
 No, memories won't go

;CHORUS
.            D                G
 I'd have thought that with time
.             C                  G
 thoughts of her would leave my head
.        D            G
 I was wrong, and I find
.           C  Em7/B Am7 C/G  D
 just one thing makes me for-get

.D         G   C   Am               G
 Red,red wine         stay close to me
.C         G            C                G
 Don't let me be alone;   it's tearing apart
.C                 G
 my blue, blue heart

;CHORUS

.D         G   C   Am               G
 Red,red wine         stay close to me
.C         G            C                G
 Don't let me be alone;   it's tearing apart
.C                 GC Am C G/B Am7 G
 my blue, blue heart</lyrics>

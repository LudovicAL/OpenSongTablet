;Intro lead
.Dm C  C  Dm C  C
                
.           Dm
 you get a shiver in the dark
.        C           Bb       A
 its raining in the park but meantime
.Dm                      C           Bb          A
 south of the river you stop and you hold everything
.F                   C
 a band is blowing Dixie double four time
.        Bb                                 Dm BbC
 you feel alright when you hear that music ring  

.         Dm              C        Bb          A
 you step inside but you don't see too many faces
.Dm                   C                  Bb      A
 coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
.F                       C
 too much competition too many other places
.Bb                                    Dm
 but not too many horns can make that sound
.Bb C
         way on downsouth
.Bb C
         way on downsouth
.Dm         DmC BbC          DmC BbC
 London town                       

.                Dm          C       Bb          A
 you check out guitar george he knows all the chords
.Dm                                           C   Bb             A
 mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
.F                       C
 and an old guitar is all he can afford
.Bb                                              DmBbC
 when he gets up under the lights to play his thing  
.Dm                    C     Bb         A
   and harry doesnb't mind if he doesn't make the scene
.Dm           C        Bb                A
   he's got a daytime job he's doing alright
.F                               C
   he can play honky tone just like anything
.Bb                      Dm     BbC
   saving it up for friday night  
.                BbC
 with the sultans  
.                     Dm  DmC BbC
 with the sultans of swing      
.DmC BbC
       

.        Dm                          C           Bb            A
 and a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner
.Dm                                    C                Bb           A
 drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
.F                               C
 they don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band
.   Bb                           Dm   BbC
 it ain't what they call rock and roll  
.               BbC
 and the sultans  
.                        Dm   DmC BbC
 and the sultans played creole      
.DmC BbC
       

 Lead 1: ( chords:Follow 1 full verse)

.Dm                    C         Bb         A
 and then the man he steps right up to the microphone
.Dm          C                Bb         A   A7
 and says at last just as the time bell rings
.F                           C
 thank you goodnight now it's time to go home
.        Bb                  Dm          BbC
 and he makes it fast with one more thing  
.                  BbC
 we are the sultans  
.                      Dm   DmC BbC
 we are the sultans of swing</lyrics>

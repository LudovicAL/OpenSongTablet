.B        F#
 Juliet's trying
.   B                 E
 To find out what she wants
.              B
 But she don't know
.      F#               B
 Experience has got her down
 Look this direction
 I know it's not perfection
 It's just me
 I want to bring you up again now

.    F#                 E           B
 I'm losing what's left of my dignity
 A small price I'll pay to see that your happy
 Forget all the disappointments you have faced
 Open up your worried world and let me in

 Juliet's crying
 Cause now she's realizing
 Love can be
 Filled with pain and distrust
 I know I am crazy
 And a bit lazy
 But I will try
 To bring you up again somehow</lyrics>

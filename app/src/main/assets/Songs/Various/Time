.F#m     A       E
                 

.F#m                                   A
 Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
.      E                                         F#m
 You fritter and waste the hours in and off handway
.F#m                                              A
 Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
.   E                                              F#m
 Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

. D9
 Tired of lying in the sunshine
.  A9
 Staying home to watch the rain
.D9
 You are young and life is long
.  A9                    A
 There is time to kill today
.     D9
 And then one day you find
.     C#m7
 Ten years have got behind you
.    Bm7
 No one told you when to run
.      E                    F#m           A               E
 You missed the starting gun                              

.F#m                                                    A
 And you run you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
.  E                                    F#m
 Racing around to come up behind you again
.F#m                                                  A
 The sun is the same in the relative way but you're older
.    E                                   F#m
 Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

.   D9
 Every year is getting shorter
.  A9
 Never seem to find the time
.D9
 Plans that either come to naught
.   A9
 Or half a page of scribbled lines
.       D9                  C#m7
 Hanging on in quiet desperation
 Is the english way
.     Bm7
 My time has gone my song is over
.    Bm            F/C            Em
 Thought I'd something more to say</lyrics>

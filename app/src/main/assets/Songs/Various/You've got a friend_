.            Em        B7                Em         B7      Em
 When you're  down and  troubled and you  need some  lovin'  care
.    Am        D                 G
 And  nothing,  nothing is going  right
.F#m                  B7               Em      B7       Em
  Close your eyes and  think of me and  soon I  will be  there
.   Am           D                  Am
 To  brighten up  even your darkest  nights

[C
.         G                          C
 You just  call out my name, and you  know, wherever I am,
.       G                   Am     D7
 I come  running to see you  again 
.G                        G7    C                     Am
  Winter spring summer or  fall  all you got to do is  call
.         C                Am
 And I'll  be there, yes I  will
[

.A             G
  You've got a  friend

.       Em    B7             Em        B7       Em
 If the  sky above you grows  dark and  full of  clouds,
.    Am              D               G
 and  that old north  wind begins to  blow
.F#m             B7             Em       B7        Em
  Keep your head  togheter, and  call my  name out  loud
.Am                   D                 Am
  Soon you'll hear me  knocking at your  door
;chorus
.F                               C
  Now ain't it good to know that  you've got a friend
.     G                 G7
 When  people can be so  cold
.       C                  Fm              Em                     Am7
 The'll  hurt you, yes and  desert you and  take your soul if you  let them
.    A7             D
 But  don't you let  them
;chorus
.A             G        D             Em
  You've got a  friend.  You've got a  friend</lyrics>

.G                       C
  We're caught in a trap; I can't walk out
.D              C              G
  because I love you too much, baby.
.G                   C
  Why can't you see,  what you're doing to me,
.D                     C          D   C Bm D7
  when you don't believe a word I say?

[C
.C              G        Bm                  C   D
  We can't go on together, with Suspicious Minds;
.Em                Bm          C              D      D7
  and we can't build our dreams, on Suspicious Minds.

.G                             C
  So, if an old friend I know, drops by to say hello,
.D                C           G
  would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
.G                 C
  Here we go again, asking where I've been.
.D                      C               D      CBm D7
  You can see these tears are real I'm crying.  

;chorus

.Em           Bm            C
  Oh, let our love survive, 
.             D
 I'll dry the tears from your eyes.
.Em                 Bm             C
  Let's don't let a good thing die, when honey,
.   D                G             C    G      D7
 you know I've never, lied to you;  Mmm, yeah,  yeah!

.G                       C
  We're caught in a trap; I can't walk out
.D              C              G
  because I love you too much, baby.
.G                   C
  Why can't you see,  what you're doing to me,
.D                     C          D   C Bm D7
  when you don't believe a word I say?</lyrics>

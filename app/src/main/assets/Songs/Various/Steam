.        B                  Gb/Bb            Db
 Give me steam, and how you feel can make it real,
.Eb7-3/Ab Ab/Eb Eb7-3     Eb7-3 Ab
 Real as anything you've seen   
.    Ab B Gb/Bb       Db        Eb7-3  Ab/Eb Eb7-3
 Get a life with this dreamer's dream

.                                Eb     Ab-3 Eb-3
 You know your culture from your trash     
.                                Eb    Ab-3 Eb-3
 You know your plastic from your cash     
.                         Eb7-3/Bb               Ab
 When I lose sight of the track you know the way back
.           Eb  Ab-3 Eb-3
 But I know you    
 You know your stripper from your paint
 You know your sinner from your saint
 Whenever heaven's doors are shut you get them open but
 I know you

;chorus2
 Give me steam, and how you feel can make it real,
 Real as any place you've been
 Get a life with the dreamer's dream

 Stand back, said stand back!
 Can't you see I've lost control
 I'm getting indiscreet
 You're moving in so close 'til I'm picking up, picking up
 This heat, this heat

;chorus1

 You know your green from your red
 You know the quick from the dead
 So much better than the rest
 You think you've been blessed
 But I know you

 You know your ladder from your snake
 You know the throttle from the brake
 You know your straight line from a curve
 You've got a lot of nerve
 But I know you

;chorus2

;rap
 Everybody nosedive - hold your breath, count to five
 Backslap, boobytrap, cover it up in bubblewrap,
 Room shake, earthquake, find a way to stay awake,
 It's going to blow, it's going to break
 This is more than I can take

 Oh yeah, I need steam
 Feel the steam around me
 Ah you're turning up the hear
 When I start to dream aloud
 See you move your hands and feet
 Won't you step into this cloud of steam,
 This steam

;chorus1 - then jam
 Help me yeah
 Ready to steam out the log jam
 Stir crazy from the freezer to the foil
 Water's bubbling, b-b-b-b-bubbling like it's coming to the boil
 Give me steam, lady
 Give me steam around me now
 Coming alive, coming alive
 Said give me some steam</lyrics>

.E                Bsus
 my name is luka  
.Asus2                            Bsus
 I live on the second floor       
.E                        Bsus
 I live upstairs from you 
.Asus2                           Bsus4
 Yes I think you've seen me before
.C#m7            Bsus4
 If you hear something late at night
.C#m7            Bsus4
 Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
.Asus2       Bsus4
 Just don't ask me what it was
.Asus2       Bsus4
 Just don't ask me what it was
.Asus2      Bsus4
 Just don't ask me what it was</lyrics>

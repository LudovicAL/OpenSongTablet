.G   C       G       Am   Em            D     Dsus4      D
 I'm looking through you, where did you go               
.G   C       G      Am   Em         D     Dsus4       D
 I   thought I knew you, what did I know              
.Em             Am             G   C    D
 You don't look different, but you have changed
.G   C       G       Am   C              G   G       C       G       C       G       C
 I'm looking through you, you're not the same                                        

.G    C    G   Am      Em       D      Dsus4     D
 Your lips are moving, I cannot hear             
.G    C     G  Am        Em                   D      Dsus4     D
 Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear            
.Em              Am              G       C   D
 You don't sound different, I've learned the game
.G   C       G       Am   C              G   G       C       G      C      G      C
 I'm looking through you, you're not the same                                     

;Bridge
.C                             G
 Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
.C                         G            D
 Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

.G      C        G  Am   Em           D     Dsus4    D
 You're thinking of me,  the same old way            
.G   C    G     Am   Em        D      Dsus4     D
 You were above me,  but not today              
.Em       Am            G      C    D
 The only difference is you're down there
.G   C       G       Am    C             G   G      C      G      C      G      C
 I'm looking through you,  and you're no where

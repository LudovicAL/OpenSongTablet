.E      A      E      A      E      D      A      E
                                                  

.E              B      A          E                    B
 Walk along the river, sweet lullaby, it just keeps on flowing,
.A                                            E    A
 It don't worry 'bout where it's going, no, no     
.E                     B              A                E
 Don't fly, mister bluebird, I'm just walking down the road,
.                 B     A                         E    A
 Early morning sunshine tell me all I need to know     

;Chorus
.B         A         E               A
 You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day.
.B                 A                      E                 A
 Lord, you know it makes me high when you turn your love my way,
.                  F#m7     E
 Turn your love my way, yeah

.E      A      E      A      E      B      C#     A
                                                  

.E               B                  A            E
 Good old sunday morning, bells are ringing everywhere.
.             B       A                              E    A
 Goin to Carolina, it won't be long and I'll be there     

;Chorus

.G                      D
 Half a mile from the county fair
.         C                  G
 And the rain keep pourin' down
.                 D
 Me and Billy standin' there
.        C                G
 With a silver half a crown
.                    D
 Hands full of a fishin' rod
 C              g
 And the tackle on our backs
.                      D
 We just stood there gettin' wet
.          C                    G
 With our backs against the fence

.Am         D
 Oh, the water
.Am         D
 Oh, the water
.Am         D
 Oh, the water
.Em                        D
 Hope it don't rain all day

.         G        C        G
 And it stoned me to my soul
.   G                  D
 Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
.         Em    G
 And it stoned me
.         G        C        G
 And it stoned me to my soul
.    G                D
 Stoned me just like goin' home
.           Em  G
 And it stoned me

.         G                   D
 Then the rain let up and the sun came up
.         C             G
 And we were gettin' dry
.              D             C               G
 Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
.         G                      D
 So we jumped right in and the driver grinned
.         C                   G
 And he dropped us up the road
.                               D
 We looked at the swim and we jumped right in
.          C                 G
 Not to mention fishing poles

.Am         D
 Oh, the water
.Am         D
 Oh, the water
.Am         D
 Oh, the water
.Em                        D
 Hope it don't rain all day

.         G        C        G
 And it stoned me to my soul
.   G                  D
 Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
.         Em    G
 And it stoned me
.         G        C        G
 And it stoned me to my soul
.    G                D
 Stoned me just like goin' home
.           Em  G
 And it stoned me

.                        D
 On the way back home we sang a song
.          C                    G
 But our throats were getting dry
.                        D
 Then we saw the man across the road
.            C               G
 With the sunshine in his eyes
.                                D
 Well he lived all alone in his own little home
.         C                G
 With a great big gallon jar
.                                 D
 There were bottles too, one for me and you
.         C                    G
 And he said Hey! There you are

.Am         D
 Oh, the water
.Am         D
 Oh, the water
.Am         D
 Oh, the water
.Em                                D
 Get it myself from the mountain stream

.         G        C        G
 And it stoned me to my soul
.   G                  D
 Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
.         Em    G
 And it stoned me
.         G        C        G
 And it stoned me to my soul
.    G                D
 Stoned me just like goin' home
.           Em  G
 And it stoned me</lyrics>

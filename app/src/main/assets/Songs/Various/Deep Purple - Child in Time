.GGAm
   

;1. verse

.GGAm
   ______Sweet Child in time
.GGAm
   ______You'll see the line
.FFG
   ______The line that's drawn between
.GGAm
   ______The good and the bad
.GGAm
   ______See the blind man
.GGAm
   ______Shooting at the world
.FFG
   ______Bullets flying
.GGAm
   ______Taking toll

.GGAm
   ______If you've been bad,
.GGAm
   ______Lord I bet you have
.FFG
   ______And you've not been hit
.GGAm
   ______By flying lead
.GGAm
   ______You'd better close your eyes
.GGAm
   ______And bow your head
.FFG
   

.GGAm
   ______Wait for the ricochet

;Same chord sequence repeated with the infamous screams over

;Instrumental passage

;2. verse:
 Sweet child in time you'll see the line
 The line that's drawn between the good and the bad
 See the blind man shooting at the world
 Bullets flying taking toll
 If you've been bad, Lord I bet you have
 And you've not been hit by flying lead
 You'd better close your eyes and bow your head
;And wait for the ricochet

;Same chord sequence repeated with the screams over

;INSTRUMENTAL - "FINALE"
;Screams and ad lib

.    E                    A
 oh, I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay
.  B                     E
 I sleep all night and I work all day
.E                     A
 he's a lumberjack and he's okay
.   B                       E
 he sleeps all night and he works all day

 I cut down trees I eat my lunch I go to the lavatory
 On wednesday I go shopping And have buttered scones for tea

.  E                 A
 I cut down trees, I skip and jump
.  B                 E
 I like to press wildflowers
.  E              A
 I put on women's clothing
.    B              E
 And hang around in bars

 I cut down trees I wear high heels Suspendies and a bra
 I wish I'd been a girlie just like my dear papa</lyrics>

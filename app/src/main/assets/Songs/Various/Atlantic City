;CAPO ON 3rd FRET!

.           Em        G                C           G
 Well, they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night
.         Em         G                  C   G
 Now, they blew up his house, too           
.           Em           G                  C      G
 Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready for a fight
.     Em        G                    C      G
 Gonna see what them racket boys can do     
.             Em         G            C     G
 Now, there's trouble bustin' in from outta state
.       Em        G           C          G
 And the D.A. can't get no relief        
.          Em     G          C             G
 Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade    
.        Em            G                        C           D
 And the gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of his teeth

[C]
.         Em     G                C        G
 Well now, ev'rything dies, baby, that's a fact
.          Em           G           D         Em
 But maybe ev'rything that dies someday comes back
.                G            C       G
 Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
.    Em       G           C       G
 And meet me tonight in Atlantic City

 Em  G  C  G

 Well, I got a job and tried to put my money away
 But I got debts that no honest man can pay
 So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
 And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus
 Now, baby, ev'rything dies, honey, that's a fact...

.D      C                          Em
 Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold
.   C         D            Em
 But with you forever I'll stay
.      C                         Em
 We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold
.C      G                          C            G
 Put on your stockin's baby, `cause the night's gettin' cold
.   C           G                C         G
 And maybe ev'rything dies, baby, that's a fact
.          C          G             D         C
 But maybe ev'rything that dies someday comes back

 Em  G  C  G

 Now, I been lookin' for a job, but it's hard to find
 Down here it's just winners and losers and don't
 get caught on the wrong side of that line
 Well, I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
 So, honey, last night I met this guy and I'm gonna
 do a little favor for him

 Well, I guess everything dies, baby, that's a fact...

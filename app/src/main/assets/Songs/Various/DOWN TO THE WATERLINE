 Key Bm:

 G / Bm / G / Bm

.Bm       F#m   A        E7      Bm
 Sweet surrender on the quay side
.Bm      F#m    A        E7         Bm
 You remember we used to run and hide
.        Bm                   F#m
 In the shadows of cargoes, I take you on time,
.A                      (D)-E
 Counting all the numbers
.                  Bm
 Down to the waterline

 Near misses on the dogleap stairways
 French kisses in the darkened doorways
 Foghorn blowing out wild and cold
 A policeman shines a light upon my shoulder

 Lead 1  G / Bm / G / A / Bm

 Up comes a coaster, fast and silent through the night
 Over my shoulder, all you can see are pilot lights
 No money in our jackets and jeans are torn
 Your hands are cold but your lips are warm

 G / Bm / G / A -

 solo:	E / C#m / G
 D / Bm  / G
 D / A
 F# / G / A / Bm

 she can see you in the jetty where you used to go
 she can see you in the places where the sailors go
 when she's walking down the river on the railway line
 she can still hear you whisper
 Lets go down to the water line

 come on.

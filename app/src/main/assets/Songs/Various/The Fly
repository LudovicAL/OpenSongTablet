;Album: ACHTUNG BABY (1991)

.         E
 It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
 It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
.              A                 D
 They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon
.                E
 You know I don't see you when she walks in the room

 It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
 It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
 They say a secret is something you tell one other person
 So I'm telling you, child

.  C#m  E
 (Love, we shine like a             A man will beg
.  A
 Burning star                       A man will crawl
 We're fallin' from                 On the sheer face of love
 Like a fly from the wall
.    C#m  E     A
 The sky... tonight)                It's no secret at all

 It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
 It's no secret that ambition bites the nails of success
 Every artist is a cannibal Every poet is a thief
 All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief

 Solo: B    E-A-D-E-B-C#m-E-A

 (Love, we shine like a              A man will rise
 Burning star                        A man will fall
 We're falling from                  From the sheer face of love
 The sky... tonight)                 Like a fly from the wall
 It's no secret at all
.        E
 It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
 The universe exploding 'cosa one man's lie
 Look I gotta go, yeah I'm running out of change
 There's a lot of things if I could I'd rearrange</lyrics>

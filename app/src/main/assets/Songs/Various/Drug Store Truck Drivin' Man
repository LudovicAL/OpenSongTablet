;CHORUS:
.       A                        E
 He's a drug store truck drivin' man
.E                            A
 He's the head of the Ku Klux Klan
.A                  D
 When summer rolls around
.D        E                    A
 He'll be lucky if he's not in town

.           A                      E
 Well, he's got him a house on the hill
.E                             D               A
 He plays country records till you've had your fill
.A                               D
 He's a fireman's friend he's an all night DJ
.D      E                                  D          A
 But he sure does think different from the records he plays

;CHORUS

 Well, he don't like the young folks I know
 He told me one night on his radio show
 He's got him a medal he won in the War
 It weighs five-hundred pounds and it sleeps on his floor

;CHORUS

 He's been like a father to me
 He's the only DJ you can hear after three
 I'm an all night musician in a rock and roll band
 And why he don't like me I can't understand

;CHORUS

 He'll be lucky if he's not in town
 (spoken:) this one's for you, Ralph.</lyrics>

;Capo on the 1st fret

.Em                      Emj7
 All in the heat of the night
.Em                            C7
 Well when things ain't going right
. B7-9                            Em
 No no no no no no no you will remember me

.A
 I came along to see your face,
.                                F#+
 But the only thing I got from you,
.     F#              Bm
 Was telling me it's fantasy,
.                       G
 That you would always be with me,
.                          D
 I can tell you that it's true
.                                          Dm7
 (i can tell you that it's true yes it is true)
.Dm7-5         C#m
  I'm waiting here,
.           F#                F#7
 But it's alright yes it's alright
.       Bm7
 It's alright with me,
.      D                E
 You better believe me now.

 I guess it's like a mountain side,
 You gotta climb it to the top,
 Floating in a sea of dreams
 The only thing that you can see
 Is the view above the clouds.
 I'm waiting here,
 But it's alright,
 Still it's alright with me,
 You better believe me now.</lyrics>

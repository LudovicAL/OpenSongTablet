;Are You Lonesome Tonight?
;Elvis Presley

.         C          Em
 Are You lonesome tonight?
.        Am
 Do You miss me tonight?
.         C         A7b9    Dm    A7   Dm
 Are You sorry we drifted apart?       
.           G7
 Does Your memory stray
 to a brighter summer day
.                       G7#5            C      Fm6  C
 when I kissed You and called You sweetheart?       
.         C9
 Do the chairs in Your parlour
.     F
 seem empty and bare?
.        D7
 Do You gaze at Your doorstep       ( Do you gaze at Your bold head
.     G           G7
 and picture me there?                and wish you had hair?        )

.         C                 Em7
 Is Your heart filled with pain?
.         D7
 Shall I come back again?
.          Dm7           G7#5       C       G7
 Tell me, Dear, are You lonesome tonight?   

;Talkin' verse: Play these chords along

 I wonder if you're lonesome tonight.. You know someone said the
 world's a stage where each must play a part. Act 1 was where we met..
 You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a ... etc.. etc..

;And finally, the last 3 lines ("Is Your...") again</lyrics>

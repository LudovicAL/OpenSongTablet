;Intro
.C     D     E     (repeat)
                   
.E   C#m7        D
 How, how can it be?
.         Bm7                  E
 That our love, copped out of caring
.           C#m7                   D
 Fashined by faith, would suffer so hard
.         Bm7                      E
 And the games we played once too often
.C#m7          D
 But making mistakes
.     Bm7                 E
 Is a part of life's imperfections
.             C#m7            D
 Borne of the years, is it so wrong
.      Bm7         E
 To be human after all?

.               C         D           E
 Drawn into the stream of undefined illusion
.              C            D                   E
 Those diamond dreams, they can't disguise the truth
;Chorus
[C
.                         C         D        E
 That there is something about you, baby, so right
.                       C        D       E
 I wouldn't be here without you, baby, tonight
[

 If ever our love
 Was concealed, no one could say that
 We didn't feel a million things
 And the perfect dream of life
 Gone, fragile but free
 We were made so tender together
 If not so in love, is not so wrong
 We're only human after all

 These changing years, they add to your confusion
 Oh when you need to hear the time that told the truth

 That there is something about you, baby, so right
 I wouldn't be here without you, baby, tonight
 Because there's something about you, baby, so right
 I couldn't live without you, baby, tonight

;Solo
.E         G        F#m      E       (2x)
                                     
;Repeat chorus chords, then fade</lyrics>

.A
 The reason why,  Oh I can't say
.                 E                   F#m   B
 I had to let you go babe, And right away   
.               A                  D       Bm
 After what you did,  I can't stay on      

.Bm                A                E
 And I`ll probably feel a whole lot better
.            D     E      A
 When you're gone

.A
 Baby for a long time,  You had me believe
.                       E                                 F#m  B
 That your love was all mine, And that's the way it would be   
.A                                            D    Bm
 But I didn't know,  That you were puttin' me on   

.Bm                A                E
 And I`ll probably feel a whole lot better
.E           D      E              A
 When you're gone,  Oh when you're gone

.A
 Now I got to say,  That it's not like before
.                  E                     F#m    B
 And I'm not gonna play, You're game any more   
.A                                 D    Bm
 After what you did,  I can't stay on   

.Bm                A                E
 And I`ll probably feel a whole lot better
.E           D     E      A
 When you're gone         
.Bm            A                E
 I`ll probably feel a whole lot better
.E           D      E              A
 When you're gone,  Oh when you're gone
.E              A         G      A      G      A      G
 Oh when you're gone

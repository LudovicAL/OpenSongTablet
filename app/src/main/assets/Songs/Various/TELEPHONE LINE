.A           Aj7
 Hello--how are you
.           A7                                       A#dim      Bm
 Have you been alright, through all those lonely lonely lonely nights,
.                 E    Bm           C#m
 That's what I'd say, I'd tell you everything,
.D               E             Aj7    Dj7
   If you'd pick up that telephone.   

 Hey--how you feelin'
 Are you still the same
 Don't you realize the things we did were all for real not a dream,
 I just can't believe
 They've all faded out of view.

. A         F#m     D           E
 Doo wop etc.      doo wah doo lang
. A         F#m            D           E
 Blue days, Black nights, doo wah doo lang
.A         F#m
   I look into the sky
.D                             E
 The love you see ain't gonna see you through
.A        F#m
   And I wonder why
.D                               E
 the little dreams we had ain't coming true

. A                 F#m                 D                   E6  E
 Oh, oh, Telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight
. A                 F#m                 D                   E6  Fdim
 Oh, oh, Telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight

 O.K. so no--one's answering,
 Well can't you just let it ring a little longer
 I'll just sit tight, through the shadows of the night
 Let it ring for evermore.

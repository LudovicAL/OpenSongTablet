;Chorus
.C              F6                Em7  Gb
 You are the sunshine of my life       
.Dm7                 G7            C   Dm7    G7
 That's why I'll always be a-round            
.C              F6              Em7    Gb
 You are the apple of my eye           
.Dm7             Dm              C     Dm7   Dbm7
 Forever you'll stay in my heart             

.C           F6      F     Cmaj7     F9  F
 I feel like this is the beginning       
.Cmaj7                 F                  E7   Em  E+  E
 Though I've loved you for a million years             
.A        D       E            Am
 And if I thought our love was ending
.         D7                        G7
 I'd find myself drowning in my own tears.   Whoa whoa

;Chorus

.C             F6    F    Cmaj7     F9  F
 You must have known that I was lonely  
.Cmaj7       F                       E7   Em  E+   E
 Because you came to my rescue                     
.A               D    E       Am
 And I know that this must be heaven
.    D7                              G7
 How could so much love be inside of you?  Whoa..

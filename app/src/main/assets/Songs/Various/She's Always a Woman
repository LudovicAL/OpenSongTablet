.        G           C              G              C
 She can kill with a smile, she can wound with her eyes
.        G         F              Fmaj7 F Fmaj7
 She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
.        G7     C              G         E
 And she only reveals what she wants you see
.    Am            Am7/G           F        G7       C C/B Am G
 She hides likes a child but she's always a woman to me

.        G       C            G           C
 She can lead to love she can take you or leave you
.        G           F                Fmaj7 F Fmaj7
 She can ask for the truth but she'll never believe you
.           G7            C           G            E
 And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free
.          Am            Am7/G           F        G7       C C/B Am G
 Yeah, she steals like a thief but she's always a woman to me

.D7                      G             C           F     Dm     G7          C B
 Oh She takes care of herself, she can wait if she wants She's ahead of her time
.Cm Cm6      F           Bb   Gm      Eb          Ab F#dim    D7          G
 Oh  and she never gives out, and she never gives in she just changes her mind

.           G           C             G         C
 And she'll promise you more than the garden of eden
.            G          F           Fmaj7       F      Fmaj7
 Then she'll carelessly cut you and laugh while you're bleeding
.        G7             C            G             E
 But she brings out the best and the worst you can be
.         Am         Am7/G            F        G7       C C/B Am G
 Blame it all on yourself cause she's always a woman to me

.       G          C        G        C
 She is frequently kind and suddenly cruel
.        G         F             Fmaj7 F  Fmaj7
 She can do as she pleases she's nobody's fool
.        G7          C             G            E
 But she can't be convicted, she's earned her degreee
.        Am                        Am7/G                    F          G7       C C/B Am G
 And the most she will do is throw shadows at you But she's always a woman to me</lyrics>

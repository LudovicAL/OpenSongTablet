;Piano plays A and Asus4 a few times

;Verse 1:
.       Asus4               A     Asus4 A
 Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong.
.                             E
 You're enchained by your own sorrow.
.E     D       E             E7          A        Asus4 A
 I-i-i-in your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow.
.      Asus4                A    Asus4 A
 How I hate to see you like this.
.         Asus4  C#min           C#add9 C#min C#add9
 There is no way you can deny it.
.E     D     E               E7    A             Asus4 A
 I-I-I-I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet.
.      Asus4             A     Asus4 A
 Chiquitita, tell me the truth.
.                       E      Esus4 E
 I'm a shoulder you can cry on,
.E D       E               E7      A            Asus4 A
 Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on.
.         Asus4          A        Asus4 A
 You were always sure of yourself.
.                          C#min   C#add9 C#min C#add9
 Now I see you've broken a feather.
.E     D E           E7       A
 I-I-I-I hope we can patch it up together.

;Chorus:
.                            D
 Chiquitita, you and I know how the heartaches come and they go
.              A
 And the scars they're leavin'.
.                       E             D         E
 You'll be dancin' once again and the pain will end,
.         E7      A
 You will have no time for grievin'.
.                      D
 Chiquitita, you and I cry but the sun is still in the sky
.    A
 And shinin' above you.
.                          E             D     E
 Let me hear you sing once more like you did before,
.           E7    A
 Sing a new song, Chiquitita.
.         E             D      E           E7        A
 Try once more like you did before, sing a new song, Chiquitita.

;Verse 2:
 So the walls came tumblin' down
 and your love's a blown out candle.
 All is gone and it seems too hard to handle.
 Chiquitita, tell me the truth.
 There is no way you can deny it.
 I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet.

 Chiquitita, you and I know how the heartaches come and they go
 and the scars they're leavin'.
 You'll be dancin' once again and the pain will end,
 you will have no time for grievin'.
 Chiquitita, you and I cry but the sun is still in the sky
 and shinin' above you.
 Let me hear you sing once more like you did before,
 sing a new song, Chiquitita.
 Try once more like you did before, sing a new sing, Chiquitita.
 Try once more like you did before, sing a new song, Chiquitita.

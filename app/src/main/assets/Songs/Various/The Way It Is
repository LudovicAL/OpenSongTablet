;intro - like verse

.Am7              Em7           D               Cadd9        G
 Standing in line marking time, waiting for the welfare dime 
.       D                Cadd9
 'Cause they can't buy a job
.Am7                      Em7              D                Cadd9        G
 The man in the silk suit hurries by as he catches the poor ladies' eyes 
.         D           Cadd9
 Just for fun he says "get a job"

;chorus
[C
.G  Fmaj7 C                       Cadd9
                  That's just the way it is
.G  Fmaj7 C
                  Some things will never change
.G  Fmaj7 C                       Cadd9
                  That's just the way it is
.G  Fmaj7 C               Cadd9             Am7  Em7
                  Ah, but don't you believe them 
[

 They say hey little boy you can't go where the others go
 'Cause you don't look like they do
 Said hey old man how can you stand to think that way
 Did you really think about it before you made the rules
 He said, Son

;chorus
;solo

 Well they passed a law in '64 to give those who ain't got a little more
 But it only goes so far
 Because the law don't change another's mind when all it sees at the hiring time
 Is the line on the color bar

;chorus
;solo - until fade</lyrics>

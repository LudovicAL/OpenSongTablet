.      Bb                                 Bb7
 Well, East cost girls are hip, ;I really dig those stiles they wear;
.        Eb
 And the Southern girls with the way they talk,
.              F7
 They knock me out when I'm down there.
.    Bb                               Bb7
 The midwest farmers' daughters realy make you feel alright,
.        Eb
 And the northern girls with the way they kiss
.                F7
 They keep their boy-freinds warm at night.

;Chorus:
[C]
.  Bb                    Cm7
 I wish they all could be California,
.  Db
 I wish they all could be California,
.  Gb                    Cb          Bb
 I wish they all could be California Girls.

.    Bb                                   Bb7
 The West coast has the sunshine, and the girls all get so tanned;
.        Eb
 I dig a French bikini on Hawaiian Islands,
.           F7
 Dolls by a palm tree in the sand.
.  Bb
 I been all around this great big world,
.         Bb7
 And I've seen all kinds of girls,
.      Eb
 But I couldn't wait to get back in the states,
.            F7
 Back to the cutest girls in the world.

;Chorus
;Repeat till fade out
.  Bb
 I wish they all could be California,
.  Eb
 I wish they all could be California;  I</lyrics>

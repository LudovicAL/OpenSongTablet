;intro
.G       D       C
                 
 (repeat 4 times)

.G                                 D          C
 Been a whole lot easier since the bitch left town,
.G                                    D      C
 Been a whole lot happier without her face around
.G                     D         C
 Nobody upstairs gonna stomp and shout
.G                                  D        C
 Nobody at the back door throwin' my laundry out
.G                               D       C
 She holds the shotgun while you dote-se-do
.G                             D           C
 She want one man made of Hercules and Cyrano
.G                                 D        C
 Been a whole lot easier since the bitch is gone,
.G                                   D        C
 Little miss little miss little miss can't be wrong

;chorus
[C
.G                                   D              C
 Little miss little miss little miss can't be wrong 
.G                                       D          G
 Ain't nobody gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
.G                                   D              C
 Little miss little miss little miss can't be wrong 
.G                                                       D           C
 What you gonna do to get into another one of these here Rock &amp; Roll songs

.G       D       C
                 
 (repeat 8 times, then)
.G       A#        C
                   

 Other people's songs they ain't your hand-me-downs
 Would it be so bad if you simply turned around
 You cook so well, all nice &amp; French
 You do your brain surgery too Momma, wit yo monkey wrench

;chorus
;break

 I hope them cigarettes are gonna make you cough
 I hope you hear this song, and it pisses you off
 I take that back I hope you're doin fine
 And if I had a dollar, I might give you ninety-nine

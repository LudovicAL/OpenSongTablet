;verse 1

.G#                  A#m
 Every finger in the room is
.F#          G#
 Pointing at me
.                      A#m
 I wanna spit in their faces then I
.F#
 I get afraid of what that could bring.
.        G#                     A#m
 I got a bowling ball in my stomach
.        F#                G#
 I got a desert in my mouth;
.C#5             A#m
 figures that my courage would choose to
.F#5
 sell out now.   I've been
.B             F#
 looking for a savior in these
.G#m          E
 dirty streets,
.F#            G#m
 looking for a savior
. E                     F#
 beneath these dirty sheets.
.          B             F#
 I've been raising up my hands ...
.              G#m
 drive another nail in
.G#m/F#    E#m7b5
 Just what God needs,
.         E
 one more victim.

[C]
.       G#m  C#m7           F#
 Why do we   crucify ourselves?
.C#m7     G#mC#m7       F#
 Every day I crucify myself.
.C#m7                   G#m
 Nothing I do is good enough for you.
.    C#m7      F#
 I crucify myself
.C#m7      G#m   C#m7       F#
 Every day     I crucify myself
.   C#m
 My heart is sick of being----
.          E
 I said my heart is sick of being in
.G#m          B
 chains..........
.E

.   C#m
 oh-oh
.G#m          B
 chains..........
.E

.   C#m
 oh-oh

;verse two, same chords at verse one

 Got a kick for a dog beggin' for love
 I gotta have my suffering so that I can have my cross
 I know a cat named Easter, he says "Whill you ever learn?"
 You're just an empty cage firl if you kill the bird

 I've been looking for a savior in these dirt streets.
 Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets.
 I've been raising up my hands, frive another nail in;
 got enough guilt to start my own religion.

;repeat chorus

.G#       A#m  B    F#
 Please   be..........
.G#   A#m  B     F#
 Save me..........
.G#  A#m B  F#   G#
 I    cry.........
.A#m
 Ahhhhh
.B      F#
    Ahhhhh
.B             F#              G#m       E
 Looking for a savior in these dirty streets
.F#            G#m        E
 Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
.F#         B            F#
 I've been raising up my hands --
.              G#m
 Drive another nail in
.G#m7/F#         E#m7b5
 Where are those angels
.         E
 When you need them?

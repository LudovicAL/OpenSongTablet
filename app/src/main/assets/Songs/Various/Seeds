.G      C           G       C       G
 Well a great black river a man had found
.      C           G          C           G
 So he put all his money in a hole in the ground
.           C         G           D         G
 And sent a big steel arm drivin' down down down
.      C                      D       G
 Now I live on the streets of Houston town

.             C        G                C     G
 Packed up my wife and kids when winter came along
.   C           G               C          G
 We headed down south with just spit and a song
.              C      G        D         G
 But they said "Sorry son it's gone gone gone
.     C         D             G
 It's gone gone gone it's all gone"

.             C            G           C        G
 Well there's men hunkered down by the railroad tracks
.          C       G               C       G
 Yeah that Elkhorn Special blowin' my hair back
.      C              G              C         G
 Tents pitched on the highway in the dirty moonlight
.      C               G               D       G
 And I don't know just where I'm gonna sleep tonight

.              C     G                       C     G
 Parked in the lumberyard we're freezin' our asses off
.   C                G               C         G
 My kids in the back seat they got a graveyard cough
.         C        G           C       G
 Well I'm sleepin' up in front with my wife
.           C              G                 C             G
 Billy club tappin' on the windshield in the middle of the night
.     C      G        D     G
 Says "Move along son move along"

.       C        G         C         G
 Well a big limousine long shiny and black
.         C           G            C          G
 Well you don't look ahead and you don't look back
.         C             G            C        G
 How many times can you get up after you been hit?
.       C        G       C         G
 Well I swear if I could spare the spit
.    C       G       C     G
 I'd lay one on your shiny chrome
.    C        G       D        G
 And send you on your way back home

.                   C          G              C          G
 So if you're gonna leave your town where the north wind blow
.   C                     G          C     G
 To go on down where that sweet soda river flow
.         C            G           C     G
 Well you better think twice twice on it Jack
.                  C        G       C            G
 You're better off buyin' a shotgun dead off the rack
.             C             G         C         G
 'Cause there ain't nothin' down here down here friend
.       C             G              D            G
 Except seeds blowin' up the highway in the south wind
.             C         D               G
 We're movin' on movin' on we're movin' on</lyrics>

.Am               G           Am
 Are you going to Scarborough Fair
.C        Am   C   D        Am
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
.         C                   G
 Remember me to one who lives there
.Am       G                  Am
 She once was a true love of mine

.Am                    G       Am
 Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
.C        Am   C   D        Am
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
.            C                   G
 Without any seam or fine needle work
.    Am          G                 Am
 And then she'll be a true love of mine

.Am                    G            Am
 Will you reap it with sickle of leather
.C        Am   C   D        Am
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
.           C                          G
 And tie it all up with a peacock's feather
.   Am    G                 Am
 Or never be a true love of mine

.Am                  G       Am
 Will you find me an acre of land
.C        Am   C   D        Am
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
.            C                    G
 Between the sea foam and the sea sand
.   Am    G                 Am
 Or never be a true love of mine

.Am                 G              Am
 will you plough it with a lamb's  horn
.C        Am   C   D        Am
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
.               C                   G
 And sow it all over with one peppercorn
.   Am    G                 Am
 Or never be a true love of mine

.Am                     G          Am
 Tell her to wash it in yonder dry well
.C        Am   C   D        Am
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
.                  C                        G
 Where water ne'er sprung, nor drop of rain fell
.    Am          G                 Am
 And then she'll be a true love of mine

.Am                 G         Am
 Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn
.C        Am   C   D        Am
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
.            C                           G
 Which never bore blossom since Adam was born
.    Am          G                 Am
 And then she'll be a true love of mine

.Am                   G             Am
 When you've done and finished your work
.C        Am   C   D        Am
  Parsley sage rosemary and thyme
.             C                   G
 Then come to me for your cambric shirt
.    Am        G                 Am
 And you shall be a true love of mine</lyrics>

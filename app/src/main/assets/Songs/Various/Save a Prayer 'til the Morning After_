.Dm         F               Bbmaj7     G           F           Dm
 You saw me standing by the wall,      corner of a main street
.        F                   Bbmaj7         G    C         Dm
 And the lights are flashing on your window sill
.     F                Bbmaj7         G       F         Dm
 All alone, ain't much fun, so you're looking for the thrill
.        F                 Bbmaj7             G  C
 And you know just what it takes and where to go

C
.Bm    Dmaj7               G    F#m             A         Bm
 Don't say a prayer for me now, save it for the morning after
.          Dmaj7               G    F#m             A
 No, don't say a prayer for me now, save it for the morning af...

.        Dm          F         Bbmaj7         G         Dm        F         Bbmaj7         G
 (... af)ter

.Dm       F                    Bbmaj7         G      F      Dm
 Feel the breeze deep on the inside, look you down into the well
.       F                   Bbmaj7           G    C         Dm
 If you can, you'll see the world in all his fire
.       F                Bbmaj7             G     F      Dm
 Take a chance, like all dreamers you can't find another way
.          F                Bbmaj7           G   C
 You don't have to dream it all, just live a day

.        Bm       D         G         F#m             A         Bm
 (... af)ter                          Save it til the morning after
.D         G         F#m             A         Dm  F         Bbmaj7         G         C         Dm        F         Bbmaj7         G
 Save it til the morning after

.Dm               F           Bbmaj7          G           F       Dm
 Pretty looking road I try to hold the rising floods that know my skin
.             F                    Bbmaj7            G     C         Dm
 Don't ask me why, I'll keep my promise, melt the ice
.            F                   Bbmaj7                G       F       Dm
 And you wanted to dance, so I asked you to dance, but fear is in your soul
.            F                      Bbmaj7        G          C
 Some people call it a one night stand but we can call it paradise

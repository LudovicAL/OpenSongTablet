.G  E   C   D G  E    C  D
                         
.G               E                            C                    D
 There's no combination of words that I could put on the back of a postcard
.G            E                C            D
 No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart and
.G   E                   C                D
 Our dreams and they are made out of real things like
.G            E                C     D
 a shoebox of photographs and sepia-toned lovin
.G           E                   C                        D
 Love is the answer at least for most of the questions in my heart like
.G          E                    C                   D
 why are we here and where do we go and how come its so hard?
.G              E                  C              D
 Its not always easy and sometimes life can be decieving
.G                 E                 C                   D
 I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together

[C]
.C                D
 mmmmm its always better when we're together
.C                      D
 Yeah well look at them stars when we're together
.C                       D
 Well it's always better when we're together
.C                      D
 Yeah its always better when we're together.

;piano solo:

 and all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
 but I know that they'll be gone when the morning light sings or brings new things
 for tomorrow night you'll see that they'll be gone too too many things I have to do.
 but if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
 I'd be under the impression I was somewhere inbetween with only 2 just me and you
 now so many things we got to do, or places we got to be we'll sit beneath the mango tree now

[C]
 Yeah its always better when we're always together
 mmmm we're somewhere in between together
 well its always better when we're together
 Yeah it's always better when we're together

;piano solo: mmmm mmm mmmm

.A#           C                     A#                 C
 I believe in memories they look so, so pretty when I sleep, hey now and
.A#            C               A#                       C
 and when I wake up you look so pretty sleeping next to me but there is
.A#           C            A#                   C
 not enough time. there is no, no song I could sing and there is no
.A#              C                            A#                   C
 combination of words I could say but I will still tell you one thing

 we're better together.

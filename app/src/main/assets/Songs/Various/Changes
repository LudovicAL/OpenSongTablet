.C                           Em
 I Still dont know what i was waiting for
.       F                G
 And my time was running wild,
.          F
 A million dead-end streets.

.   C                         Em
 And every time i thought i'd got it made
.             F                      G13
 It seems the taste was not so sweet,
.     C         Dm7     Em7    Ebm7
 So i turned my self to face me
.    Dm7                        G7
 But I've never caught a glimpse
.           C           Dm7          Em7 Ebm7
 Of how the others must see the faker
.             Dm7               G7
 I'm much too fast to take that test
.       F          C        Em       Am
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange.
.      C          F    Am                    D
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, you wanna be a richer man,
.G7       F        C        Em       Am      C F
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange.
.     Am                   D
 It's gonna be a different man.
.Am   G   Bb(add9) F       Am G    G11   C
 Time may change me -- but i  cant trace time

.C                           Em
 I watch the ripples change their size
.      F             G
 But never leave the stream
.          F
 Of warm impermanence.

.    C                Em
 And so the days flow thru my eyes
.             F                   G13
 But the days still seem the same.
.    C        Dm7      Em7    Ebm7
 And this children you spit on
.   Dm7                      G7
 As they try to change their worlds,
.      C               Dm7        Em7 Ebm7
 Are immune to your consultations.
.              Dm7                         G7
 Theyr'e quite aware of what they're going thru.
.       F          C        Em       Am
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange.
.      C          F      Am                       D
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it.
.G7       F        C        Em       Am      C F
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange.
.     Am                   D
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, there's your shame,
.     Am                   D
 you've left us up yo our neck in it.
.Am   G   Bb(add9) F       Am   G    G11   C
 Time may change me -- but you  cant trace time

.      C               Dm7          Em7 Ebm7
 Strange fascination fascinating me.
.              Dm7                         G7
 Oh changes are taking the place I'm going thru.
.       F          C        Em       Am
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange.
.      C          F      Am                       D
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, Oh look out you Rock 'n rollers
.       F          C        Em       Am
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange.
.     Am                   D
 Ch-ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get a little older.
.Am   G   Bb(add9)   F         Am   G    G11C
 Time may change me, But i can't trace time.</lyrics>

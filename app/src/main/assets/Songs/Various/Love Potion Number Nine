.A                          D           A                            D
 I took my troubles down to Madame Rue, you know that gypsy with the gold capped tooth
.C                        A             D
 She's  got a pad down on 34th and Vine selling little bottles of

 Love potion number nine

.A                       D                 A                          D
 I told her that I was a flop with chicks, I've been that way since 1956
.C                             A                  D

 I didn't know if it was day or night, I started kissing everything in sight
.C                               A             D
 But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine he took my little bottle of
.E
 Love potion number nine

.A                       D             A                      D
 I didn't know if it was day or night, I started kissing everything in sight
.C                               A             D
 But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine he took my little bottle of

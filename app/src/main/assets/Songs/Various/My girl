.         C        F           C
 I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
.                       F                     C
 When it's cold outside I've got the month of may
.  F       G         F                G
 I guess you'll say what can make me feel this way
.C                    F  G
 My girl talkin' bout my girl

.C                      F                  C
 I've got so much honey the bees they envy me
.C          F                                  C
 I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
.        F       G         F                G
 Well, I guess you'll say what can make me feel this way
.C                    F  G
 My girl talkin' bout my girl

.C F          C
      hey hey hey
.C F          Dm G
      hey hey hey

.C       F             C
 I don't need no money 
.C        F                          C
 I've got all the riches one man can take
.  F       G         F                G
 I guess you'll say what can make me feel this way</lyrics>

;CHORUS:
.D     G    D    G
 Mary Jane, Mary Jane
.D
 Please don't leave me baby
.G                     D G
 I'll just find you again

;VERSE 1
.D              G
 I asked my uncle
.D           G
 If I could go
.D            G
 Yes, yes go out and take
.      A
 Mary Jane to the picture show
.D                  G
 But uncle bob sighed
.D                G
 He could not answer
.D               G
 He dies one second before
.        A
 In the arms of a go-go dancer

;Chorus

;BRIDGE:
.A       G
 I wanna roll you
.C
 way down in the fields
.                D
 where you were born
.A       G
 I wanna roll you
.C         D
 When I'm ragged
.       D
 And forlorn

;Guitar solo, Chorus pattern

;Bridge

 You have no friend
 You have no pet
 If there's anything better than you
 You know I haven't found it yet

;Chorus, fade to end.</lyrics>

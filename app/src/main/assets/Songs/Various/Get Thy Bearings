.Em       F#m     Am          Em
 Get your bearings, know your time.
.Em        F#m  Am          Em
 Don't you worry, weather's fine.
.G       D/F#        Em       Bm
 All the world knows what I'm saying,
.G       D/F#        Em       Bm
 All the world knows what I'm saying,
.G         D/F#       Em
 The world knows fine well.

 Sax solo
 It's just double bass and sax for a while but when the guitar comes back its just
 Em. Same for outro.

 near the end play this

 Get together, work it out,
 Simplicity is what it's about.
 All the world knows what I'm saying,
 All the world knows what I'm saying,
 The world knows fine well.

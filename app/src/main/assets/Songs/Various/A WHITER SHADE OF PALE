.C                       Am
 We skipped the light fandango
.F                                Dm
 And turned cartwheels across the floor
.G                     Em     G7
 I was feeling kind of seasick
.C                            Am  Em
 But the crowd called out for more
.F                    Dm
 The room was humming harder
.G                    Em G7
 As the ceiling flew away
.C                       Am     Em
 When we called out for another drink
.F                    Dm
 The waiter brought a tray

;Chorus
.G13       C6  Cmaj7      Am   C
 And so it was      that  later
.F                      Dm
 As the miller told his tale
.G                           Em
 That her face at first just ghostly
.G7       C      F        C   G7 C
 Turned a whiter shade of pale

 She said "There is no  reason,
 And the truth is plain to see,"
 But I wandered through my playing cards
 And would not let her be
 One of sixteen vestal virgins
 Who were leaving for the coast
 And although my eyes were open
 They might just as well have been closed

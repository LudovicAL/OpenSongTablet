;Traditional, arranged by The Dubliners

.      G                               D7                   G
 I'll tell me ma when I get home, the boys won't leave the girls alone,
. G                                  D7                 G
 Pulled me hair, stole me comb but that's allright till I go home.
.  G               C             G                   D7
 She is handsome, she is pretty she is the Belle of Dublin city,
.  G                 C                G           D7       G
 She is a courtin' a one two three, Pray can you tell me who is she?

; (For the next verses, you can swap the chord patterns of the
; first two lines and second two lines, so you start with G C G D7
; for the first line. Dubliners usualy do swap, but not always.
; Do as you like better....)

 Albert Mooney says he loves her, all the boys are fightin' for her,
 Knock at the door, ring at the bell, and "Oh, me true love, are you well?"
 Out she comes, white as snow, rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
 Ould Johny Morrissey says she'll  die,
 if she doesn't get a fella with the roving eye.

 Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high,
 and the snow comes a travelin' through the sky,
 She's as sweet as an apple pie, she'll get her own lad by and by,
 When she gets a lad of her own, she won't tell her ma when she gets home.
 Let them all come as they will, It's Albert Mooney she loves still.</lyrics>

.C                     F             C
  Baby let me be, your  loving Teddy  Bear.
.F                                           C
  Put a chain around my neck and lead me any  where.
.          G7                 C
 Oh let me  be (t) your Teddy  Bear.
.  F                     G7           F                G7
 I  dont want to be your  tiger cause  tigers play too  rough.
.  F                     G7
 I  dont want to be your  lion,
.      F               G7             C
 Cause  lions aint the  kind you love  enough.
.               C
 (t) Just wanna  be your Teddy Bear.
.F                                           C
  Put a chain around my neck and lead me any  where.
.          G7                 C     F7 G7
 Oh let me  be (t) your Teddy  Bear  
.C                  F                C
  Baby let me be, a  round you every  night.
.F                                                    C
  Run your fingers through my hair and cuddle me real  tight.
.          G7                 C
 Oh let me  be (t) your Teddy  Bear.
.  F                     G7           F                G7
 I  dont want to be your  tiger cause  tigers play too  rough.
.  F                     G7
 I  dont want to be your  lion,
.      F               G7             C
 Cause  lions aint the  kind you love  enough.

 (t) Just wanna  be your Teddy Bear.
.F                                           C

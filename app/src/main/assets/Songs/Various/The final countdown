.F#m
 We're leaving together
.                    Hm7
 but still it's farewell
.F#m
 cause maybe we'll come back
.E7                 A
 to earth, who can tell
.D                 E7
 I guess there is no one to blame,
.A               F#m
 we're leaving ground
.D                 C#m          E
 Will things ever be the same again?

.E               F#m      DHm7
 It's the final countdown  
.E          F#m      DHm7 E
 The final countdown   
[

.F#m
 We're heading for Venus
.                    Hm7
 and still we stand tall
.F#m
 Cause maybe they've seen us
.     E7        A
 and welcome us all
.D             E7
 With so many lightyears to go
.A                 F#m
 and things to be found
.D                C#m           E
 I'm sure that we all miss her so

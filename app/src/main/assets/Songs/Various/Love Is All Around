;Intro Riff Again
.  D               Em        G            A     D    Em G   A
 I see your face before me,      as I lay on my bed         
.  D            Em        G              A         D     Em G   A
 I kinda get to thinking      of all the things we said         
.    D              Em      G              A       D    Em G   A
 You gave a promise to me,      and I gave mine to you         
.  D              Em       G           A       D   Em G   A
 I need someone beside me      in everything I do

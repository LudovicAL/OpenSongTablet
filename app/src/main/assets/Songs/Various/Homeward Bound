.     G
 I'm sitting in a railway station,
.       Bm            F     E   E7
 Got a ticket for my destination.
.Am
 On a tour of one night stands,
.     F
 My suitcase and guitar in hand,
.      G
 And every stop is neatly planned
 For a poet and a one man band.

;Chorus:
.    G      C
 Homeward bound,
.          G              C
 I wish I was homeward bound,
.  G               C
 Home, where my thoughts are 'scaping,
.  G              C
 Home, where my music's playing,
.  G            Am                  Am7         D
 Home, where my love lies waiting silently for me.

 Everyday's an endless stream
 Of cigarettes and magazines.
 And each town looks the same to me,
 The movies and the factories,
 And every stranger's face I see
 Reminds me that I long to be...

;Chorus.

 Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
 I'll play the game and pretend,
 But all my words come back to me
 In shades of mediocrity,
 Like emptiness in harmony,
 I need someone to comfort me.

;Chorus.</lyrics>

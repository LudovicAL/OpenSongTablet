.G                           D7
 Desmond had a barrow in the market place,
.                         G
 Molly is the singer in a band.
.                G7            C
 Desmond says to Molly, girl I like your face
.          G                D7               G
 and Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.

[C
.      G                       Bm      Em
 Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on      bra.
.G             D7        G
 La la how the life goes on. (repeat)

.G                              D7
 Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweller's store,
.                           G
 buys a twenty carat golden ring.
.                 G7             C
 Takes it back to Molly, waiting at the door
.          G               D7            G
 and as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

.NC             C                                  G
 In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
.NC               C
 with a couple of kids running in the yard
.   G                 D7
 of Desmond and Molly Jones.

.G                       D7
 Happy ever after in the market place,
.                                 G
 Desmond lets the children lend a hand.
.               G7                C
 Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
.           G                 D7                G
 and in the evening she still sings it with the band.

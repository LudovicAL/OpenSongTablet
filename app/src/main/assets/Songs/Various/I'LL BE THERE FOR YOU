;Intro:

.                                Dm
 I guess this time you're really leaving
.F                             C
 I hear your suitcase say good-bye
.                            Dm
 and as my broken heart lies bleeding
.F                        C
 you say true love is sui-cide.

.                             Dm
 You say you cried a thousand rivers
.F                               C
 and now you're swimming for the shore
.Am                         Dm
 you left me drowning in my tears
.F                         G
 and you won't save me any-more.
.N.C.
 I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance girl.

;CHORUS:
[C]
.C
 I'll be there for you
.Am
 these five words I swear to you
.         Dm
 when you breathe I wanna be the air for you
.F       G         C
 I'll be there for you.
.C
 I'd live and I'd die for you
.Am
 I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
.Dm
 words can't say what love can do
.F       G         C
 I'll be there for you.
[]

 I know you we've had some good times
 now they have thir own hiding place
 I can promise you tomorrow
 but I can't buy back yesterday.
 And baby you know my hands are dirty (and baby you know my hands are dirty)
 but I wanted to be your valentine
 I'll be the water when you get thirsty baby
 when you get drunk I'll be the wine. (Jon's scream)

;CHORUS

 And I wasn't there when you where happy
 and I wasn't there when you were down, down down
 I didn't mean to miss your birthday baby
 I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out.

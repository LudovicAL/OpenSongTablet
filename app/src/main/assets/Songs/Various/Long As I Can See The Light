.B       F#            B       E6
         Put a candle in the window
.B         G#m              B
         Cause I feel I've got to move
.B            F#     E7
         Though I'm goin', goin' I'll be comin' home soon
.B         F#            B      E   F#
         Long as I can see the light

.B         F#                B
         Pack my bag and let's get moving
.B           G#m              B
         Cause I'm bound to drift a while
.B          F#    E7
         When I'm gone, gone you don't have to worry
.B         F#            B      E   F#
         Long as I can see the light

.B            F#                     B
         Guess I've got that old travelin' bone
.B            G#m                     B
         Cause this feeling won't leave me alone
.B       F#     E7
         But I won't, won't be losing my way
.B         F#            B      E   F#
         Long as I can see the light</lyrics>

.A                      D          E                A
 Don't start me talking;   I could talk all night.  
.A                        D          C#7                          F#m
 My mind goes sleepwalking while I'm putting the world to right.  
.               B           F#m                  B       E  A
 Called careers information.  Have you got yourself an occupation?

[C
.A                D       E      A                 D        E
 Oliver's Army is here to stay.  Oliver's Army are on their way.
.A             F#m                D          E  A         D
   And I would rather be anywhere else but here today.

.D             E7
               

.A                              D          E          A
 There was a checkpoint Charlie, he didn't crack a smile.
.A                          D                C#7           F#m
 But it's no laughing party when you've been on the murder mile.
.               B              F#m                B          E
 Only takes one itchy trigger, one more widow one less white nigger.

;Chorus
.D    E6   E
           

.F#m            E             D          C#
   Hong Kong is up for grabs;  London is full of Arabs.
.D               E          D              E
  We could be in Palestine, overrun by the Chinese line
.         D                            E
 with the boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne.

.A                      D          E            A
 But there's no danger.  It's a professional career,
.                                 D               C#7             F#m
 though it could be arranged with just a word in Mr. Churchill's ear.
.                 B                   F#m
 If you're out of luck you're out of work
.                   B   E     A    D     E
 We could send you to Johannesburg       

.A                D       E     A                 D        E
 Oliver's Army is here to stay  Oliver's Army are on their way.
.A              F#m                D          E  A
    And I would rather be anywhere else but here today.(3 times)

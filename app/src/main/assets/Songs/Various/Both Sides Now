.G    Am    G    D
                 
.G        Am       C     G                   Bm      C      G
 Bows and flows of angel hair, and ice-cream castles in the air,
.             C      Am                                     D
 And feather canyons everywhere; I've looked at clouds that way.
.    G        Am   C         G                  Bm      C    G
 But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone,
.          C      Am                                    D
 So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way.

.      G        Am          C          G         C       G
 I've looked at clouds from both sides now, from up and down,
.     C        G        Bm       C      G
 And still somehow it's cloud illusions I recall;
.   C                D  Dsus   D  G    Am    G    D
 I really don't know clouds    at all.            

.G         Am        C      G                 Bm      C       G
 Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel
.         C     Am                                        D
 As every fairy tale comes real; I've looked at love that way.
.    G        Am     C     G                    Bm       C        G
 But now it's just another show, you leave them laughing when you go,
.           C          Am                                 D
 And if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away.

.      G        Am        C          G         C        G
 I've looked at love from both sides now, from give and take,
.     C        G        Bm        C      G
 And still somehow it's love's illusions I recall;
.   C                D Dsus   D  G    Am    G    D
 I really don't know love     at all.            

.G         Am        C       G                Bm        C         G
 Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say "I love you" right out loud;
.           C           Am                                      D
 Dreams and schemes and circus crowds; I've looked at life that way.
.    G       Am          C      G                         Bm          C        G
 But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they say I've changed.
.                C        Am                                 D
 Well somethings lost but something's gained in living every day.

.      G        Am        C          G         C       G
 I've looked at life from both sides now, from win and lose,
.     C        G        Bm        C      G
 And still somehow it's life's illusions I recall;
.   C                D  Dsus   D  G    Am    C    D    G
 I really don't know life      at all.

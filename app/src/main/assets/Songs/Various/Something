.C                        Cmaj7 C7                        F
 Something in the way she moves attracts me like no other lover
.D                        G          Am                      G#+
 Something in the way she woos me, I don't want to leave her now
.    C/G               D     F   Eb  G   C
 You know I believe in how   (intro riff)

.C                          Cmaj7 C7                         F
 Somewhere in her smile she knows that I don't need no other lover
.D                           G           Am                      G#+
 Something in her style that shows me, I don't want to leave her now
.    C/G               D     F   Eb  G   A
 You know I believe in how   (intro riff)

;Bridge
.A             C#m             F#m
 You're asking me will my love grow
.A       D      G       A     G#      G       F#      F      E
 I don't know   I don't know                                 
.A          C#m              F#m
 You stick around and it may show
.A       D      G       C
 I don't know   I don't know

.C                        Cmaj7 C7                      F
 Something in the way she knows and all I have to do is think of her
.D                           G           Am                      G#+
 Something in the things she shows me, I don't want to leave her now
.    C/G               D     F  Eb  G  C
 You know I believe in how</lyrics>

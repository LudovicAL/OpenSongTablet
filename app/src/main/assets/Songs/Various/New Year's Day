.Am     C        Em
 All is quiet on New Year's Day
.Am         C           Em
 A world in white, gets underway
.Am        C                        Em
 I want to be with you, be with you night and day
.Am      C          Em         Am
 Nothing changes on New Year's Day
.   Em
 On New Year's Day

;Chorus:
.G              Am
 I will be with you again
.G              F    Am  C Em
 I will be with you again

.Am      C         Em
 Under a blood red sky
.Am      C            Em
 A crowd has gathered black and white
.Am     C           Em
 Arms entwined, the chosen few
.Am             C     Em       G
 Newspaper say, says, say it's true, it's true
.Am
 And we can break through
.       G                   F
 Though torn in two, we can be one

.G           Am
 I, I will begin again
.G         F            Am  C Em Am
 I, I will begin again, yeah

;Repeat Chorus and fade out</lyrics>

.F                                       Dm
  Post office clerks put up signs saying  position closed
.F                                         Dm
  And secretaries turn off typewriters and  put on their coats
.Bb                        F
  And janitors padlock the  gates
.    C                   Dm
 For  security guards to  patrol
.Bb                            F
  And bachelors phone up their  friends for a drink,
.          C                       Dm
 While the  married ones turn on a  chat show.

.            F              Bb                  F
 And they'll  all be lonely  tonight and lonely  tomorrow.

 Gentlemen time please, you know we can't serve anymore
 Now the traffic lights change to stop, when there's nothing to go
 And by five o'clock everything's dead
 And every third car is a cab
 And ignorant people sleep in their beds
 Like the doped white mice in the college lab.

;Chorus
[C
.F                 Bb        F                   Bb
  And nothing ever  happens,  nothing happens at  all
.Dm                         Bb
  The needle returns to the  start of the song
.       C                    Bb
 And we  all sing along like  before
.          F              Bb                   F
 And we'll  all be lonely  tonight, and lonely  tomorrow.

 Telephone exchanges click while there's nobody there
 The Martians could land in the carpark and no-one would care
 Close-circuit cameras in department stores
 Shoot the same movies everyday
 And the stars of these films neither die nor get killed
 Just survive constant action replay.

;Chorus

 Bill hoardings advertise products that nobody needs
 While Angry from Manchester writes to complain about
 All the repeats on T.V.
 And computer terminals report some gains
 On the values of copper and tin
 While American businessmen snap up Van Goghs
 For the price of a hospital wing.

 Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all
 The needle returns to the start of the song
 And we all sing along like before
 Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all
 They'll burn down the synagogues at six o'clock
 And we'll all go along like before

 And we'll all be lonely tonight, and lonely tomorrow.</lyrics>

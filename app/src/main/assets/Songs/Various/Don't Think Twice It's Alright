.C                       G              Am
 Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe
.F                    C  G
 If you don't know by now
.C                      G              Am
 And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe
.D7                  G  G7
 It don't matter any how
.C                              C7
 When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
.F                        D7
 Look out your window and I'll be gone
.C          G/B        Am         F
 You're the reason I'm travelling on
.   C            G          C
 But don't think twice it's alright

 And it ain't no use in turning on your light babe
 That light I never knowed
 And it ain't no use in turning on your light babe
 I'm on the dark side of the road
 I wish there was something you would do or say
 To try and make me change my mind and stay
 But we never did too much talking anyway
 So don't think twice it's alright

 And it ain't no use in calling out my name babe
 Like you never did before
 Ain't no use in calling out my name babe
 I can't hear you any more
 I'm thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
 I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
 I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
 But don't think twice it's alright

 I'm walking down that long lonesome road babe
 Where I'm bound I can't tell
 But goodbye is too good a word babe
 So I'll just say fare thee well
 I ain't saying you treated me unkind
 You could have doen better but I don't mind
 You just kinda wasted my precious time
 But don't think twice it's alright</lyrics>

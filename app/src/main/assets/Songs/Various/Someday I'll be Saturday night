.E                     A
 Hey man I'm alive I'm takin' each day and night at a time
.    B                         A                       E
 I'm feelin' like a Monday but someday I'll be Saturday night

.E
 Hey my name is Jim, where did I go wrong
.G#m
 My lifes a bargain basement, all the good shits gone
.A
 I just cant hold a job, where do I belong
.E                         B           E
 Im sleeping in my car, my dreams move on

.E
 My name is Billy Jean, my love was bought and sold
.G#m
 I'm only sixteen, I feel a hundred years old
.A
 My foster daddy went, took my innocence away
.B
 The street life aint much better, but at least I get paid

.    A
 And Tuesday just might go my way
.   E
 It can't get worse than yesterday
.G#m
 Thursdays, Fridays aint been kind
.    B
 But somehow I'll survive

.E                     A
 Hey man I'm alive I'm takin' each day and night at a time
.E                                B
 Yeh Im down, but I know I'll get by
.            E
 Hey hey hey hey, man gotta live my life
.       A
 Like I aint got nothin' but this roll of the dice
.   B                          A                        E         A
 Im feelin' like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night     

.E
 Now I cant say my name, and tell you where I am
.G#m
 I want to roll myself away, dont know if I can
.A
 I wish that I could be in some other time and place
.B
 With someone elses soul, someone elses face

.    A
 Oh Tuesday just might go my way
.   E
 It can't get worse than yesterday
.G#m
 Thursdays, Fridays aint been kind
.    B
 But somehow I'll survive

.E                     A
 Hey man I'm alive I'm takin' each day and night at a time
.E                                B
 Yeh Im down, but I know I'll get by
.            E
 Hey hey hey hey, man gotta live my life
.         A
 Im gonna pick up all the pieces and whats left of my pride
.   B                          A                        E
 Im feelin' like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night

.A     E      A
                    (solo) ( starts on last mesure of chorus)

.E        A             E        A
   Oh_____     Saturday night      Here we go
.E
 Some day I'll be Saturday night
.        A
 I'll be back on my feet, I'll be doin alright
.   E
 It may not be tomorrow baby, thats OK
.  A
 I aint goin' down, gonna find a way, hey hey hey

.E                     A
 Hey man I'm alive I'm takin' each day and night at a time
.E                                B
 Yeh Im down, but I know I'll get by
.            E
 Hey hey hey hey, man gotta live my life
.       A
 Like I aint got nothin' but this roll of the dice

.         E         A
 Saturday night__________,   (fade out)</lyrics>

.G           D          A           D
 Pedro lives out of the Wiltshire Hotel
.               G              D    A D
 He looks out a window without glass
.    G                   D            A                D
 The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
.                                G           D    A D
 His father beats him 'cos he's too tired to beg..

 He's got 9 brothers and sisters, they're brought up on their knees
 Its hard to run when a coathanger beats you on the thighs
 Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
 But thats a slim chance, he's going to the boulevard..

;Chorus
 He's going to end up on the Dirty Boulevard
 He's going out on the Dirty Boulevard
 He's going down to the Dirty Boulevard
.chords once through

 This room cost $300 a day you can believe it man its true
 Somewhere a landlords laughing till he wets his pants
 No one dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
 They dream of dealing on the Dirty Boulevard

 Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor I'll piss on them
 That's what the statue of bigotry says
 Your poor huddled masses lets club 'em to death
 Get it over with and just dump 'em on The Boulevard

;Repeat Chorus

 Outside it a bright night there's an opera at Lincoln Centre
 And movie stars arrive by limousine
 The kleig light shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
 But the lights are out on the mean streets

 A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
 He's selling plastic roses for a buck
 The traffics backed up to 39th Street
 The TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck

 Back at the Wiltshire,Pedro sit there dreaming
 He's found a book on magic in a garbage can
 He looks at the pictures and stares up at the cracked cieling
 "At the count of 3" he says "I hope I can disappear"
 And fly fly away....

;Repeat and fade</lyrics>

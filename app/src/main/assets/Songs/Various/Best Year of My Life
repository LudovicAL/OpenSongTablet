 It was the first weekend in April, and there was only two weeks until
.         F#                            Abm7/F#
 I was to meet a man who said he had a plan
.          B                               C#
 He said I need a quick decision, so I can make the first incisions
.        F#                               B
 In an attempt to make you feel a better man
.       E                                F#m7
 Wasn't long since I had met you, didn't feel that I could tell you
.     A                                 B
 So I told a cock and bull tale just in case
.              E                                    F#m7
 And when they put me back together, said I'd be as good as new forever
.      A                                 B
 And I couldn't wait to tell you my good news

.C#         Ebm                F#      Ab                       C#
 Life is so easy, when you are near me,   you make everything alright
.C#              Ebm                      F#                Ab                            B/C# C# B/C# C# 
 And through the dark times, my wondering why times, You've given me, the best year of my life

.     F#                                  Abm7/F#
 So I moved my world to join you, left my old life as you should do
.       F#                             Abm7/F#
 And we made our home together me and you
.          B                         C#
 There was you and me and Otis, then Charlie came to join us
.F#                                     B
 And our new start was completed right away
.       E                       F#m7
 It was my idea of heaven, we enjoyed how we were living
.       A                             B
 And we made the best of every single day
.      E                                       F#m
 After all these years of searching, at last I found what I was seeking
.            A                               B
 I found the woman who completes me in every way

.C#              Ebm                      F#                Ab                            B/C# C# B/C# C# 
 And through the dark times, my wondering why times, You've given me, the best year of my life

;Intro
 |Am  Dm  G  G/B  (C) |

 Talk to me softly there's something in your eyes
 Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
 I know how you feel inside I've I've been there before
 Somthin' chengin' inside you and don't you know

;Chorus
.F                 Am
 Don't you cry tonigh
 I still love you baby
.F                 Am
 Don't you cry tonight
.F                 Am
 Don't you cry tonight
.             C
 There's a heaven above you baby
.F             G             Am
 And Don't you cry       tonight

 Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
 Give me a kiss befiore you tell me goodbye
 Don't you take it so hard now
 And please don't take it so bad
 I'll still be thinking of you
 And the times we had baby

 |C5  G/B  A5  G5  F5  G5  A5|

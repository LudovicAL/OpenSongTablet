.          Dm
 Everybody knows that the dice are loaded.
.          Bb
 Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
.          Dm
 Everybody knows the war is over.
.          Bb
 Everybody knows the good guys lost.
.          Gm                  A
 Everybody knows the fight was fixed:
.              C                  Dm
 The poor stay poor, the rich get rich.
.              Eb   A           Dm
 That's how it goes.  Everybody knows.

.          Dm
 Everybody knows that the boat is leaking.
.          Bb
 Everybody knows the captain lied.
.          Dm
 Everybody got this broken feeling
.           Bb
 like their father or their dog just died.
.          Gm               A
 Everybody talking to their pockets.
.          C              Dm
 Everybody wants a box of choc'lates
.                Eb   A           Dm
 and a long stem rose.  Everybody knows.

.          Dm
 Everybody knows that you love me, baby.
.          Bb
 Everybody knows that you really do.
.          Dm
 Everybody knows that you've been faithful,
.Bb
 give or take a night or two.
.          Gm                        A
 Everybody knows you've been discret,
.                       C                      Dm
 But there were so many people you just had to meet
.             Eb      A               Dm
 without your clothes.  And everybody knows.

;Chorus:
[C]
.          F                C                        Dm   C     Bb        F
 Everybody knows. Everybody knows. That's how things goes.      Everybody knows.
.          F                C                    Dm   C      Bb        F
 Everybody knows. Everybody knows. That's how it goes.       Everybody knows.

.Dm            Dm
 And everybody knows that it's now or never.
.          Bb
 Everybody knows that's me or you.
.              Dm
 And everybody knows that you live forever
.            Bb
 when you've done a line or two.
.          Gm                A
 Everybody knows the deal is rotten:
.          C                   Dm
 Old black Joe's still picking cotton
.                    Eb    A               Dm
 for your ribbon and bows.   And everybody knows.

.          Dm
 Everybody knows that the plague is coming.
.          Bb
 Everybody knows that it's moving fast.
.          Dm
 Everybody knows that the naked man and the woman
.           Bb
 are just a shining artifact of the past.
.          Gm                 A
 Everybody knows the scene is dead,
.                  C                  Dm
 But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
.             Eb   A                Dm
 that will disclose  What everybody knows.

.              Dm
 And everybody knows that you're in trouble.
.          Bb
 Everybody knows what you've been through,
.                Dm
 from the bloody cross on top of Calvary
.       Bb
 to the beach of Malibu.
.          Gm                 A
 Everybody knows it's coming apart:
.         C                        Dm
 Take one last look at this sacred heart
.          Eb     A               Dm
 before it blows.   And everybody knows.

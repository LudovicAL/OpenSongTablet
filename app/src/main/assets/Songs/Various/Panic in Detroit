 The only survivor of the National People's Gang.

 He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone.

;verse 2
 He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom.
 The police had warned of repercussions.
 They followed none too soon.
 A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive.

 chorus
 Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
 He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone.
 Panic in Detroit.

.D                                 C
 Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
.B                      C                G
 and I found my teacher crouching in his overalls.

.D                                       C
 I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
.B                     C                  D
 and jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights.

 Bm    G     A

;verse 3
 Having scored a million dollars, made a run back home.
 Found him slumped across a table.  A gun and me alone.
 I ran to the window.  Looked for a plane or two.

 Panic in Detroit.  He'd left me an autograph.
 "Let me collect dust."  I wish someone would phone.

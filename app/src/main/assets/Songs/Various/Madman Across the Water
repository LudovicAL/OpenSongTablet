.      Am  Am/G F
 I can see very well
.          C/E                     D/F#
 There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
.          F      G    Am
 And I can see it very well
.          Am         Am/G         F
 There's a joke and I know it very well
.            C/E                   D/F#
 It's one of those that I told you long ago,
.        F          G                Am
 Take my word I'm a madman don't you know

.C             G/B           Esus E
 Get a load of him he's so insane 
.                C/E  D/F#    F     G    Am
 Better get your coat dear it looks like rain

.C/E        D/F#       F        G    Am
 We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
.C/E        D/F#         F       G    Am
 The inlaws hope they'll see you very soon
.Fmaj7                                   Esus   E FG
 But is it in your conscious that you're after     
.Am                     F      G          Am
 Another glimpse of the madman across the water

.                  Am/G             F
 Once a fool had a good part in the play
.        C/E                 D/F#
 If it's so would I still be here today
.           F             G             Am
 It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
.                F          G            Am
 They think it's very funny everything I say
.C                G/B                      Esus    E
 Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted 
.              C/E        D/F#          F   G     Am
 Will you come again next week well I'm not gonna fake it</lyrics>

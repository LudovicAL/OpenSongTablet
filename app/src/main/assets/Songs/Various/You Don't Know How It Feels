.E               A                 E             A
 Let me run with you tonight, I'll take you on a moonlight ride
.E A E A
       
.E                 A                E                A
 There's someone I used to see, but she don't give a damn for me
.E A E A
       

;CHORUS:
.           E          D            E            A
 But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
.             E     D              E          A
 And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
.E         D           A
 You don't know how it feels
.E         D           A              E
 You don't know how it feels... to be me

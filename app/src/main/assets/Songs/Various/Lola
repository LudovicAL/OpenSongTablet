;Intro:
.C      D      E
               

.   E
 I met her in a club down in old Soho where you
.A                      D                       E             A Asus4
 drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry cola  C-O-L-A cola
.    E
 She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
.  A                           D
 I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said
.E             A    D             C        D     E
 Lola  L-O-L-A Lola   Lo lo lo lo Lo - la        

;play riff

 Well I'm not the world's most physical guy,
 but when she squezzed me tight she nearly broke my spine.
 You know my Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola
 Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
 why she walked like a woman, but talked like a man.
 I know my Lola, Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola, Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola

;play riff

.          B7
 Well we drank champagne and danced all night
.F#7
 under electric candle light
.    A
 She picked me up and sat me on her knee and
.A
  said "pretty boy won't you come home with me?"

 Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
 but when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my
 Lola  Lo lo lo lo Lo - la   Lo lo lo lo Lo - la
 Lola  Lo lo lo lo Lo - la   Lo lo lo lo Lo - la

;play riff

.  A      E    B     A      E      B       A    E      B
 I pushed her away I walked to the door  I fell to the floor
.      E    G#7   C#m        B                          B13 E
 I got down on my knees Then I looked at her and she at me  

 Well, that's the way that I want it to stay...
 I always want it to be that way for my Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola
 Girls will be boys and boys will be girls,
 It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world,
 Except my Lola Lo Lo Lo Lo Lola

 Hey and I'd left home just a week before,
 And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
 Well Lola smiled and took me by the hand,
 Said pretty boy, gonna make you a man.

 Well I'm not the world's most passionate man,
 But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man and so is Lola.
 Lola  Lo lo lo lo Lo - la   Lo lo lo lo Lo - la
 Lola  Lo lo lo lo Lo - la   Lo lo lo lo Lo - la

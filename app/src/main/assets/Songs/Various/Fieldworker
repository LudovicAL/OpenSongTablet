.Bm              A  G              A  Bm              A  G              A  Bm
                                                                           
.        A         G             A        Bm
 Digging in your fields, pulling up your food
.           A  G                   A  Bm
 No matter how I feel, don't do me no good
.          A      G               A     Bm
 Treat me like a human, is all I got to say
.             A     G                         A   Bm
 The man that I am working for, won't let me get away

.Bm              A  G              A  Bm              A  G              A  Bm
                                                                           

.          A         G               A       Bm
 I came across your border, just to work for you
.            A     G                 A   Bm
 I give you all I got to give, what more can I do
.               A       G                  A     Bm
 Don't give me law and order, tell me to stick around
.               A       G                         A       Bm   A  G
 While standing in the picket line, you try and shoot me down, down

.   D                       Bm
 I come to your country to work on the land
.  D                        Bm
 Watching the seeds as they die in the sand
.  D                              Bm                 A   G    A Bm
 Fighting for your freedom with a hoe in your hand fieldworker
.  A   G    A Bm
 Fieldworker

.        A         G             A        Bm
 Digging in your fields, pulling up your food
.           A  G                   A  Bm
 No matter how I feel, don't do me no good
.          A      G               A     Bm
 Treat me like a human, is all I got to say
.             A     G                         A   Bm
 The man that I am working for, won't let me get away

.Bm              A  G              A

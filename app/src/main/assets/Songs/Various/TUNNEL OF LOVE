[Intro]  Dm   - C  - Dm / Bb / Dm / F - C / Dm / Bb

.                      Dm     F                          C
 getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that i choose
.G                                                       Dm
 sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tatoo
.              Dm                     F                    C
 and i've been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
.G                                               Dm
 and i don't know where i'll be tonite but i'd always tell you where i am

 in a screaming ring of faces i seen her standing in the light
 she had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
 i put my hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
 i had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

.Dm                                 Bb  C        F          Bb
         and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
.        F
 and i'm high on the world
.                Dm                Bb
 come on take a low ride with me girl
.                  Dm F C DmBb
 on the tunnel of love      

 it's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
 she said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
 it's just a cakewalk twisting baby step right up and say
 hey mister give me two give me two cos any two can play

 and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
 and i'm high on the world
 come on take a low ride with me girl
 on the tunnel of love
.               Gm                        Bb
 well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
.Gm                              Bb
     money for muscle another girl i dig
.Gm                              Bb
     another hustle just to make it big
.    C
 and rockaway rockaway

.F                                  C Dm
    and girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
.Bb C                             F Bb             C
      like the spanish city to me when we were kids
.      F                         C Dm
 oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
.Bb C                            F Bb              C
      like the spanish city to me when we were kids

 oh la!  ...    check it out.

 she took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
 she put her hand in my pocket i got a keepsake and a kiss
 and in the roar of dust and diesel i stood and watched her walk away
 i could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stay

 and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
 and i'm high on the world
 come on take a low ride with me girl
 on the tunnel of love

 and now i'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
 searching everywhere from steeplechase and palisades
 in any shooting gallery where promises are made
 to rockaway rockaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to rockaway

 and girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
 like the spaninh city to me when we were kids
 oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
 like the spanish city to me when we were kids</lyrics>

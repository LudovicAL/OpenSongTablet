.G             Bm             C           D7         D7b9
 When you were young and your heart was an open book 
.G           Bm               C
 You used to say life and let life
.              C/D               D7               G
 (You know you did, you know you did you know you did)
.G           Bm                 C                A7
 But in this ever changing world in which we live in
.          D7      Am  D7      Bb/D
 makes you give in and cry     

.                 G  C/G
 Say live and let die
.             GdimG7
 live and let die 
.             G  C/G
 live and let die
.             GdimGm
 live and let die 

.C9
 What does it matter to ya
.G7
 when you got a job to do
.          D7
 you gotta do it well
.          Em                    F       Gm
 you gotta give the other fellow hell

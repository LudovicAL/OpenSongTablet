 Seven-thirty-seven comin' out of the sky

 won't you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride

[C
.        A                            E
 I wanna move, playin' in a travelin' band
.         B                       A
 well I'm flyin' 'cross the land, tryin' to get a hand
.B                      E
 playin' in a travelin' band

 Take me to the hotel, baggage gone, oh well
.E
 come on come on won't you get me to my room
;Chorus

 Listen to the radio talkin' 'bout the last show

;Chorus

;Solo

 with your fuzzing and your fighting won't you get me to the ride
;Chorus

 Oh I'm playing in a travelin' band, playing in a travelin' band
.A                              E
 won't you give my town a hand, playing in a travelin' band
;  not sure about this ^^ one
.         B                       A

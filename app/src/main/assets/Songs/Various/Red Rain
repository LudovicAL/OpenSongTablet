  Red rain is coming down, red rain
.Cmaj7D               Cmaj7         D              Em
  Red rain is pouring down, pouring down, all over me

.     Em                 D/E                Em
 I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream
.Em               D/E                 Em
  I cannot make a single sound as you scream
.Em7               A/E                       Em
  It can't be that cold, the ground is still warm to touch
.   Em                      D/E                 C
 We touch, this place is so quiet, sensing that storm

;chorus

 Well I've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town
 They tell you that this rain can sting, and look down
 There is no blood around see no sign of pain
 No pain, seeing no red at all, see no rain

.....
.....
 Putting the pressure on much harder now
 To return again and again

 Just let the red rain splash you
 Let the rain fall on your skin
 I come to you defences down
.                    Em
 With the trust of a child

;chorus

.            C                  Em
 And I can't watch any more, no more denial
.        C
 It's so hard to lay down in all of this

;chorus - repeat 3 times
 - I see it - I'm bathing in - I'm begging you
.     D         Cmaj7   Dsus4
 Over me in the red red sea
.     Cmaj7 Dsus4 Em
 Over me  Over me Red rain</lyrics>

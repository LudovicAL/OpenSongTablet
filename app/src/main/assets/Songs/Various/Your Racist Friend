;They Might Be Giants

;Intro:
.Em

;Chorus:
.         G         C     D     C                   D
 This is where the party ends - I can't stand here listening
.    G  C            D      G   D C D
 to you - and your racist friend
.        G        C    D      C              D
 I know politics bore you but I feel like a hypocrite
.            G  C            D      G
 talking to you - and your racist friend

;1.
.Em
 It was the loveliest party that I've ever attended
 if anything was broken I'm sure it could be mended
 my head can't tolerate this bobbing and pretending
 listen to some bullet-head and the madness that he's saying

;Chorus:
 This is where the party ends I'll just sit here wondering
 how you stand by your racist friend
 I know politics bore you but I feel like a hypocrite
 talking to you - and your racist friend

;Instrumental:
 (Em for four bars)

.   D       GA
 |:           :|  (x7)
.D

;(1st Chorus)

;3.
 Out from the kitchen to the bedroom to the hallway
 your friend apologizes, he could see it my way
 he let the contents of the bottle do the thinking
 can't shake the devil's hand and say you're only kidding

 (1st Chorus to ending)
.            G  C            D      G   C D
 talking to you - and your racist friend

.D              G       D      A              D
 If you see her say hello, she might be in Tangiers
.                   G     D                         C     A
 She left here last early spring, is living there I hear  
.Bm              G     D                                G
 Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow
.          Bm                 D                 G                 D
 She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so

.D        G       D         A            D
 We had a falling out, like lovers often will
.                        G         D                           C      A
 And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill  
.    Bm             G  D                         G
 And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
.Bm                D                 G           D
 She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart

.D          G        D    A                 D
 If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
.                G       D                                      C     A
 I always have respected her, for doin' what she did and gettin free  
.    Bm             G    D                      G
 Whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
.         Bm                 D                   G                         D
 Tho' the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her st
 ay

.D              G  D    A             D
 I see a lot of people, as I make the rounds
.                    G        D                          C     A
 And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town  
.         Bm           G       D                                G
 And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
.Bm            D             G               D
 Maybe I'm too sensitive, or else I'm gettin soft

.D        G      D     A            D
 Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
.             G        D                        C     A
 I know every scene by heart, it all went by so fast  
.Bm             G         D                         G
 If she's goin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
.Bm               D          G                D
 Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time

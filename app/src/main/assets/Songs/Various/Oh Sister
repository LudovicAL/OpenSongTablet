.G         Bm           C             G
 Oh sister when I come, to ly in your arms.
.G              Bm              C    G
 You should not treat me like a stranger.
.G          Bm                 C            G
 Our father would not like the way that you act,
.G            Bm          C  G
 And you must realize the danger.

 Oh sister am I not a brother to you.
 And one deserving of affection.
 And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
 To love and follow his direction.
.F          C                 G
 We grew up together from the cradle to the grave.
.F                  C                G         D    G
 We died and were reborn and left mysteriously saved

 Oh sister when I come to knock on your door
 Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
 Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore.
 You may not see me tomorrow.</lyrics>

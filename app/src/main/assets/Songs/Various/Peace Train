 Now I've been happy lately thinking about the good things to come
.    G    Am                F            G    F
 and I believe it could be    Something good has become

 Oh I've been smiling lately dreaming about the world as one
 and I believe it could be    Someday it's going to come

 Cause out on the edge of darkness there rides a peace train
 Oh pease train take this country come take me home again

 Now I've been smiling lately thinking about the good things to come
 and I believe it could be    Something good has begun

.       C   G    C        G  C    F   C      F           F G Am
 Oh peace train sounding louder glide on the pease train oooo

   Come on the peace train
.     C G    C    G    C  F       C          F           F G Am
 Peace train holy roller everone jump on the peace train oooooo
.F        G            F
   Come on the peace train

 Get your bags together go bring your good friends too
 Cause it's getting nearing it soon will be with you

 Oh come and join the living It's not so far from you
 And it's getting nearer soon it will all be true

.       C   G    C        G  C    F   C      F           F G Am

 Now I've been crying lately thinking about the world as it is

 Cause out on the edge of darkness there rides a peace train
 Oh pease train take this country come take me home again

.      Bm      E7 G                   F#m7
 We're jamming    I wanna jam it with you
.      Bm      E7            G                     F#m7
 We're jamming jamming and I hope you like jamming too

.         Bm             E7         Bm       E7
 Ain't no rules ain't no vow we can do it anyhow
.    G                       F#m7
 And I Jah know will see you through
.                  Bm            E7            Bm          E7
 'Cos every day we pay the price with a loving sacrifice   
.        G               F#m7
 Jamming till the jam is through

.      Bm      E7            G                          F#m7
 We're jamming to think that jamming was a thing of the past
.      Bm      E7    G                      F#m7
 We're jamming and I hope this jam is gonna last

.   Bm                 E7             Bm              E7
 No bullet can stop us now we neither beg nor will we bow
.        G                 F#m7
 Neither can be bought nor sold
.                  Bm             E7          Bm          E7
 We all defend the right that the children us unite       
.     G                  F#m7
 your life is worth much more than gold

.              Bm              E7             G                          F#m7
 We're jamming jamming jamming jamming, we're jamming in the name of the Lord
.              Bm              E7             G                           F#m7

.Bm             E7        Bm             E7   G                F#m7

.     Bm            E7           Bm           E7     G            F#m7

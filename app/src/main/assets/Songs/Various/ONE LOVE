 Hear the children crying.  (One heart.)  Sayin',
.      Eb                       Bb              F               Bb

 Let them all pass all their dirty remarks.  (One love.)
.             Gm           Eb     F           Bb
 There is one question I'd really love to ask.  (One heart.)

 Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
.                     Gm          Eb    F            Bb
 who has hurt all man-kind just to......save his own?

 Believe me,One love, one heart.

 so shall it be in the end. (One heart.) Alright,

 Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon, (One love.)
.            Gm              Eb      F           Bb
 So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom.  (One song.)
.             Gm               Eb      Bb
 Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner.
.                       Gm             Eb     F      Bb
 There ain't no hidding place from the Father of Creation.

 Sayin', One love, one heart.
.Eb          Bb         F              Bb

;Leonard Cohen
;from Columbia Records' release THE FUTURE by LEONARD COHEN (CK 53226)

;Introduction:
 Am   /    /

.                                 Dm
 Give me back my broken night, my mirrored room, my secret life
.     G6                      E7          Am
 it's lonely here, there's no one left to torture
.                         Dm
 Give me absolute control over every living soul
.    G6                            Am
 And lie beside me baby, that's an order!
.                           Dm
 Give me crack an anal sex, take the only tree that's left
.    G6              E7              Am
 and stuff it up the hole in your culture
.                              Dm
 Give me back the Berlin Wall, give me Stalin and St. Paul
.     G6               E7              Am
 I've seen the future, brother:  it is murder.

;Chorus:
.Dm                      C
 Things are gonna slide (slide) in all directions
.         Dm                                   C
 Won't be nothing (won't be) nothing you can't measure anymore.
.    Dm                             F
 The blizzard, the blizzard  of the world has crossed the threshold
.           Fm                          C
 and it has overturned the order of the soul
.          G
 When they said (they said) REPENT (repent) REPENT (repent)
.         Am
 I wonder what they meant
.          G
 When they said (they said) REPENT (repent) REPENT (repent)
.         Am
 I wonder what they meant
.          G
 When they said (they said) REPENT (repent) REPENT (repent)
.         Am
 I wonder what they meant

 You don't know me from the wind, you never will, you never did
 I'm the little jew who wrote the bible
 I've seen nations rise and fall, I've heard their stories, heard them all
 but love's the only engibe of survival
 Your servant here he has been told to say it clear to say it cold:
 It's over, it ain't going any further
 And now the wheels of heaven stop, you feel the devil's riding crop
 Get ready for the future:  it is murder.

;repeat chorus

;third verse:
 There'll be the breaking of the ancient western code
.     Dm
 Your private life will suddenly explode
.            Am
 There'll be phantoms, there'll be fires on the road
.                  F7     E
 and the white man dancing
.                Am
 You'll see your woman hanging upside down
.     Dm
 her features covered by her fallen gown
.            Am
 and all the lousy little poets coming around
.                             F7    E
 trying to sound like Charlie Manson
.                  Am
 and the white man dancing
.                              Dm
 Give me back the Berlin Wall, give me Stalin and St. Paul
.G6                E7          Am
 Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima
.                              Dm
 Destroy another fetus now, we don't like children anyhow
.     G6               E7           Am
 I've seen the future, baby:  it is murder.

;repeat chorus

.          G                                               Am
 When they said (they said) REPENT (repent) REPENT (repent)

 Intro        ....

.G             C         Csus4      C
 If you didn't care                 
.                 G Gsus4 G
 what happened to me
.             C   Csus4 C
 And I didn't care

.     G       Gsus4     G             A               G(frm2) A G(frm2)
 For you.                    We would zig-zag our way   
.            A7                     G              C
 Through the boredom and pain.      Occasionally   glancing
.      D              G      Am             F                 Am        F
 up through the rain       Wondering       which of the buggers to blame

.C    Am7/B   Am         D        Dsus4   D               G
                     And watching         for pigs on the wing.

 Part 2 is the same chords played to new lyrics, with the rhythm varied a bit.</lyrics>

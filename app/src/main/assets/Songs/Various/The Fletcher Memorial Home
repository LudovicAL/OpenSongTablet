.G                       C             G/B Am
 Take all your overgrown infants away, somewhere,
.                 D              Bb+            Bm  A/C#
 And build them a home, a little place of their own.
.D   Em                C                  D      Em7  D/F#  G     C
 The Fletcher Memorial Home for incurable tyrants     and   kings.
.    G                      C                G/B Am
 And they can appear to themselves every day,
.                  D            Bb+                Bm   A/B Bm
 On closed circuit T.V. to make sure they're still real.
.C                   D         Em
 It's the only connection they feel.

.                                      Cmaj7
 "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Reagan and Haig,
.                           D
 Mr. Begin and friend, Mrs. Thatcher and Paisley,
.    Cmaj7
 Mr. Brezhnev and party, the ghost of McCarthy,
.                           D
 The memories of Nixon. And now adding colour,
.  G                  D/F#                C
 A group of anonymous Latin-American meat packing glitterati."

.Em                                           D
 Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?
.         G            D/F#       C
 They can polish their medals and sharpen their smiles,
.     G          D/F#         C
 And amuse themselves playing games for a while.
.G        D/F#         C               Emadd9
 Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead.

.G  D/F#  Em  D/F#  G  D/F#  Em  D  Cmaj7  D
                                           
.G  D/F#  C  D  G  D/F#  Cmaj7  D  G  D/F#  Cmaj7  Emadd9
                                                   

.G                     C              G/B   Am
 Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye,
.                    D                Bb+            Bm
 With their favorite toys, they'll be good girls and boys.
.A/C# D   Em                C                 D          Em7  D/F#  G
 In   the Fletcher Memorial Home for colonial wasters of life and   limb.
.D/F#           C       G      D/F#   Cadd9
 Is everone in? Are you having a nice time?
.        D/F#    C               Emadd9
 Now the final solution can be applied.</lyrics>

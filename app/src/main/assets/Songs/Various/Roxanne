 Oh!

 I loved you since I knew you
 I wouldn't talk down to you
 I have you to tell just how I feel
 I won't share you with another boy

 I know my mind is made up
 So put away your make up
 Told you once I won't tell you again
 It's a bad way

 Roxanne....  You don't have to put on the red light
 Roxanne....  You don't have to put on the red light

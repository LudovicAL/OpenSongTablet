.Em      D        G
 On the turning away
.          C             Em
 From the pale and downtrodden
.         D          G
 And the words they say
.          C
 Which we won't understand
.  Em                       C    G
 "Don't accept that what's happening
.Em                         G    C
 Is just a case of all the suffering
.G                           C      Em
 Or you'll find that you're joining in
.     D        G
 The turning away"

.Em      D            G
 It's a sin that somehow
.           C           Em
 Light is changing to shadow
.     D              G
 And casting it's shroud
.     C
 Over all we have known
.Em               C           G
 Unaware how the ranks have grown
.  Em            G         C
 Driven on by a heart of stone
. G                       C     Em
 We could find that we're all alone
.         D            G
 In the dream of the proud

.Em      D            G
 On the wings of the night
.        C           Em
 As the daytime is stirring
.            D          G
 Where the speechless unite
.      C
 In a silent accord
.Em                    C          G
 Using words you will find are strange
.     Em                 G          C
 And mesmerised as they light the flame
. G                     C
 Feel the new wind of change
.Em      D            G
 On the wings of the night

. Em      D        G
 No more turning away
.          C            Em
 From the weak and the weary
.         D        G
 No more turning away
.          C
 From the coldness inside
. Em                 C          G
 Just aworld that we all must share
.Em                        G          C
 It's not enough just to stand and stare
.G              C                  Em
 Is it only a dream that there'll be
.         D        G
 No more turning away ?</lyrics>

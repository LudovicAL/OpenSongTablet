;intro:
.Abm Abm/B  Db/F     Db7sus4/GbAbm Abm/B Db/F Db7sus4/Gb
  I'm on my way, I'm making it       
.Abm Abm/B    Db/F    Db7sus4/Gb  Abm Abm/B Dbsus4/Gb
  I've got to make it show, yeah      
.Abm Abm/B Db/F Db7sus4/Gb  Abm Abm/B Db/F Db7sus4/Gb
    So much larger than life      
.Abm Abm/B     Db/F     Db7sus4/Gb Abm Abm/B Dbsus4/Gb
  I'm going to watch it growing,        hey hey hey
.Abm    Ebsus4/Ab Abm B/Ab Db7/Ab Bbm/Ab Abm
 Hey....          

.Db7/Ab                 Db7sus4/Ab
 The place where I come from is a small town
.Dbm7/Ab                             Abm
 They think so small, they use small words
.        Db7/Ab                   Db7sus4/Ab
 But not me, I'm smarter than that, I worked it out
.Dbm7/Ab                                    Abm
 I've been stretching my mouth to let those big words come right out
.         Db7/AB                           Db7sus4/Ab
 I've had enough, I'm getting out, to the city, the big big city
.Dbm7/Ab                                    Abm
 I'll be a big noise with all the big boys, so much stuff I will own
.G-5                           Db7/F
 And I will pray to a big god, as I kneel in the big church

;chorus:
[C]
.Abm       Abm/B     Db/F     Db7sus4/Gb
 Big time, I'm on my way, I'm making it
.Abm       Abm/B Db/F Db7sus4/Gb
 Big time      
.Abm       Abm/B       Db/F    Db7sus4/Gb
 Big time, I've got to make it show, yeah
.Abm       Abm/B Dbsus4/Gb
 Big time    
.Abm       Abm/B Db/F Db7sus4/Gb
 Big time,  So much larger than life
.Abm Abm/B Db/F Db7sus4/Gb
       
.Abm       Abm/B        Db/F     Db7sus4/Gb
 Big time, I'm going to watch it growing,
.Abm       Abm/B
 Big time

.   Gbsus4      Gb        Gbsus4      Gb
 Oh oh oh,   oh oh oh  oh oh oh,   oh oh oh

 My parties all have big names
 And I greet them with the widest smile
 Tell them how my life is one big adventure^
 And always they're amazed
 When I show them round my house, to my bed
 I had it made like a mountain range
 With a snow-white pillow for my big fat head
 And my heaven will be a big heaven
 And I will walk through the front door

;chorus
.Dbsus4/Gb

 My car getting bigger
 Big time, my house getting bigger
 Big time, my eyes getting bigger
.                 Gbsus4/Gb Gb
 Big time, and my mouth 
 Big time, my belly is getting bigger
 Big time, and my bank account
 Big time, look at my circumstance
.                  Db7sus4/Gb                              Abm
 Big time, and the bulge in my big big big big big big ... big</lyrics>

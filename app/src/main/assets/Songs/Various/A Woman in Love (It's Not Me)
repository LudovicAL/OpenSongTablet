[Intro         

.Bm                      A
 She laughed in my face, told me goodbye
.G                                      A
 Said "Don't think about it, you can go crazy.
.Bm                   A
 Anything can happen, anything can end
.G                                   A
 Don't try to fight it, don't try to save me."

;Chorus 1
[C
.                 Bm AD E
 She's a woman in love  
.                 Bm AD E
 She's a woman in love  
.               Bm                   A
 And he's gonna break heart heart in pieces
.D               E
 She don't wanna see
.                 Bm A D E
 She's a woman in love,  
 but it's not me
[

 Well alright. Do what you want
 Don't try to talk, don't say nothin'
 She used to be the kind of woman
 You have and you hold, she could understand the problem
 She let the little things go

;Chorus 2
[C
.                 Bm AD E
 She's a woman in love  
.                 Bm AD E
 She's a woman in love  
.               Bm                   A
 And he's gonna break heart heart in pieces
.D               E
 She don't wanna know
.                 Bm A D E
 She's a woman in love,  
 She can't let go.
[

 Time after time, night after night
 She would look up at me
 And say she was lonely
 I don't understand the world today
 I don't understand what she needed
 I gave her everything, she threw it all away
 On nothing

;Chorus 1, repeat and fade</lyrics>

.A                         Asus4
 We crossed the line       
.A                         Asus4
 Who pushed who over?      
.A                         Asus4
 It doesn't matter to you  
.A                         Asus4
 it matters to me          
.A                         Asus4
 We're cut adrift          
.A                         Asus4
 But still floating        
.A                         Asus4
 I'm only hanging on       
.A               E           A
 To watch you go down...my love

 I disappeared in you
 You disappeared from me
 I gave you everything you ever wanted
 It wasn't what you wanted
 The men who love you, you hate the most
 They pass through you like a ghost
 They look for you but your spirit is in the air
 Baby...you're nowhere

.A D E A
 Aaaaaaah,
.A          D          E      A
 You say in love there are no rules
.A  D  E  A            E
 Oh......love  Sweetheart
.           A
 You're so cruel

 Desperation is a tender trap
 It gets you every time
 You put your lips to her lips
 To stop the lie
 Her skin is pale like God's only dove
 Screams like an angel for your love
 Then she makes you watch her from above
 And you need her like a drug
 You say in love there are no rules

 Oh......love  Sweetheart, you're so cruel

.F#m
 She wears my love
.        D
 Like a see-through dress
.A
 Her lips say one thing
.    E
 Her movements something else
.   C#m
 Oh love, like a screaming flower
.                      A
 Love, dying every hour

 And you don't know if it's fear or desire
 Danger the drug that takes you higher?
 Head of heaven, fingers in the mire
 Her heart is racing... you can't keep up
 The night is bleeding like a cut
 Between the horses of love and lust
 We are trampled underfoot

 You say in love there are no rules
 Oh......love  Sweetheart
 You're so cruel

 To stay with you I'd be a fool
.   D      C#m       A           E
 oh....hah           hah   Sweetheart
.          A
 You're so cruel.</lyrics>

.E      A      E                A
 Lady Madonna, children at your feet
.E              A      E      C  D    E
 Wonder how you manage to make   ends meet
.              A     E                A
 Who finds the money when you pay the rent
.E                  A     E   C  D   E
 Did you think that money was heaven sent?

.Am                             D
 Friday night arrives without a suitcase
.G                              Em
 Sunday morning creeping like a nun
.Am                                    D7
 Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
.G   Am6         B7
 See how they'll run

.E      A      E            A
 Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
.E              A         E        A
 Wonder how you manage to feed the rest
.E      A      E             A
 Lady Madonna, lying in your bed
.E             A     E       C  D    E
 Listen to the music playing in your head

.Am                         D
 Tuesday afternoon is never ending
.G                               Em
 Wednesday morning papers didn't come
.Am                                   D
 Thursday night your stockings needed mending
.G   Am6         B7
 See how they'll run

.E      A      E                A
 Lady Madonna, children at your feet
.E              A         E         A
 Wonder how you manage to make ends meet</lyrics>

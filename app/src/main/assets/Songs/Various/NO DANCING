.        D                       A
 Oh, I kmow that she has made a fool of him,
.                 D
 Like girls have done so many nights before,
.          A
 Time and time again.
.              D                    A
 Life is so strange.  I don't know why,
.         D                     Gm
 But somebody, somebody has to cry.
.                D      A           G          D
 There's gonna be no dancing when they get home.

.                G      A
 There's gonna be no dancing, no,
.                G      A
 There's gonna be no dancing,
.                G      A                   Bb  D
 There's gonna be no dancing when they get home.

 Now he's telling her ev'ry little thing he's done.
 Once he glanced at the jackets of some paperbacks.
 Now he's read ev'ry one.
 He's such a drag.  He's not insane.
 It's just that ev'rybody has to feel his pain.
 There's gonna be no dancing when they get home.

.Bb
 He's getting down on his knees.
.Dm                 Bb                            Dm
 He finds that her brother's not so easy to please, oh, oh.
. Bb                                F
 After all, his nights were just a paper striptease.
.      A7sus4                   A7
 She's caught it like some disease.
.           N.C.
 If he says no dancing, there's gonna be no dancing,
.                   G    A         Bb  D
 There's gonna be no dancing on my own.

 She can't even speak to him.  He can't face her now.
 He says, "Even though I wanna shake your hand,
 All I ever do is bow.
 So now you see how it can be.
 Why can't you give me ev'rything but sympathy?
.                D      A
 There's gonna be no dancing,
.                D      A
 There's gonna be no dancing,
.                Bb     F
 There's gonna be no dancing,
.                Bb     F
 There's gonna be no dancing
.                Bb     F
 There's gonna be no dancing
.                Bb     F          Eb    D
 There's gonna be no dancing on my own.</lyrics>

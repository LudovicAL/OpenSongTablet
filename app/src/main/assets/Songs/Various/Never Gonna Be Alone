.E              B                     C#m
 Time, is going by, so much faster than I,
.                                  A
 And I'm starting to regret not spending all of here with you.
.     E              B                             C#m
 Now I'm, wondering why, I've kept this bottled inside,
.                                 A
 So I'm starting to regret not selling all of it to you.
.               F#m                        A
 So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know...
 
[C]
.                   E
 Never gonna be alone!
.                  A                                E
 From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,
.              A
 I won't you fall...
.                  E
 Never gonna be alone!
.                     B          A
 I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone.
 
[V2]
.     E                 B                              C#m
 And now, as long as I can, I'm holding on with both hands,
.                                       A
 'Coz forever I believe that there's nothing I could need but you,
.               F#m                        A
 So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know...
 
[C]
.                  E
 Never gonna be alone!
.                 A                                  E
 From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,
.                  A
 I won't let you fall.
.                   E                              A
 When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on.
.                           E
 We're gonna see the world out,
.                    B          A
 I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone.
 
[V3]
.F#m C#m A B
        Ooooh!
.                    F#m         C#m
 You've gotta live every single day,
.               A                    B
 Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
.       F#m          C#m
 Don't let it slip away,
.              A                  B
 Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun.
. F#m          C#m
 Every single day,
.           A                   B
 Maybe our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
.          A
 Tomorrow never comes...
 
[Verse 4]
.E              B                      C#m
 Time, is going by, so much faster than I,

 From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,

 I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone.
.                   E  B  A
 I'm gonna be there always,
.                     E     B    A
 I won't be missing a word all day,
.                   E  B  A
 I'm gonna be there always,
.                     E     B    A
 I won't be missing a word all day.

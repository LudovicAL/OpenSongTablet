. D                A
 Have you seen the old man
.         Hm         F#m
 By the closed down market
. G              D               E7        A
 Kicking up the papers with his worn out shoes
.D                   A
 In his eyes you'll see no pride
. Hm                F#m
 Hand held loosely by his side
.G            D              A7          D
 Yesterday's paper, telling yesterday's news.

[C
.    G           D                    A7  Hm
 So how can you tell me that you're lone-ly
.E7                              A7
 And say for you the sun don't shine
. D               A
 Let me take you by the hand
.     Hm                     F#m
 And lead you through the streets of London
.G              D            A7                   D
 I'll show you something to make you change your mind.

. D                A
 Have you seen the old girl
.     Hm                   F#m
 Who walks the streets of London
. G           D             E7            A
 Dirt in her hair and her clothes all in rags
.  D                A
 She's no time for talking
.          Hm             F#m
 She just keeps right on walking
. G            D        A7         D
 Carrying her home in two carrier bags.

.D                 A
 In the all night cafe
.      Hm            F#m
 At a quarter past eleven
. G        D            E7         A
 Same old man sitting there on his own
. D              A              Hm         F#m
 Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
.G                  D
 each tea lasts an hour
.        A7            D
 and he wanders home alone

. D                A
 Have you seen the old man
.    Hm                F#m
 outside the seamen's mission
. G                      D     E7             A
 Memory fading with the medal ribbon that he wears
.D              A
 in our winter city
.           Hm            F#m
 The rain cries a little pity
.         G              D
 for one more forgotten hero
.      A7                 D
 In a world that doesn't care.

.Em                D            Em7
 This one goes out to the one I love
.Em                D                Em7
 This one goes out to the one I've left behind
.Gsus4 G     D      C
 A simple prop to occupy my time
.Em                D            Em7
 This one goes out to the one I love

 Fire !

;repeat first verse

 This one goes out to the one I love
 This one goes out to the one I've left behind
 Another prop has occupied my time
 This one goes out to the one I love</lyrics>

.A       C#             F#m            D
  People  stared at the  makeup on his  face
.A               F#m               E           C#
  Laughed at his  long black hair,  his animal  grace
.F#m             D
  The boy in the  bright blue jeans
.A                C#
  Jumped onto the  stage
.    A              E
 And  lady stardust  sang his songs
.   D                E
 Of  darkness and disgrace

.           A  E         D             E
 And he was  alright the  band was altogether
.           A  E         D                E
 Yes he was  alright the  song went on forever:
.           Em     Em7
 And he was  awful  nice
.Em6                  Em5
  Really quite out of  sight
.            A    E           D
 And he sang  all  night long 

.A        C#                     F#m
  Femme fatales emerged from the  shadows
.              D
 To watch this  creature fair
.A             F#m
  Boys stood upon their chairs
.   E                    C#
 To  make their point of  view
.F#m       D            A                  C#
  I smiled  sadly for a  love I could not obey
.    A              E
 And  lady stardust  sang his songs
.   D                E
 Of  darkness and dismay

.           A  E         D             E
 And he was  alright the  band was altogether
.           A  E         D                E
 Yes he was  alright the  song went on forever
.           Em     Em7
 And he was  awful  nice
.Em6               Em5
  Really quite paradise
.            A    E           D
 And he sang  all  night long 

.A         F#m               E
  Oh how I  sighed when they  asked if I knew his name

.           A  E         D             E
 And he was  alright the  band was altogether
.           A  E         D                E
 Yes he was  alright the  song went on forever
.           Em     Em7
 And he was  awful  nice
.Em6               Em5
  Really quite paradise
.            A    E           D
 And he sang  all  night long

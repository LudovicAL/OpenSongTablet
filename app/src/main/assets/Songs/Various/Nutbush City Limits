.E
 Church-house Gin-house
 School-house Out-house
 on highway number nineteen
 the people keep the city clean

;chorus
[C
.             G
 they call it Nutbush
.   D
 oh Nutbush
.        E
 call it Nutbush city limits
[

 Twenty-five was the speed limit
 a motorcycle not allowed in it
 you go to school on Fridays
 to go to church on Sundays

;chorus

 You're gonna feel on weekdays
 and have a picnic on Labour Day
 you go to town on Saturdays
 but go to church every Sunday

;chorus
 Nutbush city limits
;solo

 There's no whiskey for sale
 you get caught no bail
 Soft Port and Molasses
 is all you get in jail

;chorus

 Nutbush - one more time (3x)
;break
 Nutbush - one more time (repeat)</lyrics>

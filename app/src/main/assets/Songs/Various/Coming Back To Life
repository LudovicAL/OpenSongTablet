.C                                    F
 Where were you when I was burned and broken
.          Am              G              F
 While the days slipped by from my window watching
.C                                        F
 Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
.Am                             G                 F
 Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
.               Am                  F
 While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
.Am                           Bb
 Dying to believe in what you heard
.Am7                    G                C
 I was staring straight into the shining sun

.C                   F
 Lost in thought and lost in time
.          Am                    G                    F
 While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
.   C                           F
 Outside the rain fell dark and slow
.        Am               G                          F
 While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
.Am                                 F
 I took a heavenly ride through our silence
.Am                       Bb
 I knew the moment had arrived
.    Am7                  G              C
 For killing the past and coming back to life

.C    C    F    F
                
.Am    G    F    F
                 
.C    C    F    F
                
.Am    G    F    F
                 
.Am                                F
 I took aheavenly ride through our silence
.Am                     Bb
 I knew the waiting had begun
.Am7                      G                C
 And headed straight... Into the shining sun

.C    C    F    F
                
.Am    G    F    F

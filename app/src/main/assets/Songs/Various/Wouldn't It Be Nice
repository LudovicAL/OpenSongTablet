;Verse 1:
.                F
 Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
.                 Bb             Gm7
 And we wouldn't have to wait so long
.    C7              F
 And wouldn't it be nice to live together
.                Bb              Gm7 C7
 In the kind of world where we belong

.Dm7/A                      Cm7/F
 You know it's gonna make it that much better
.Dm7/A                         Am7     Gm7  C7
 When we can say goodnight and stay together

;Verse 2:
 Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
 In the morning when the day is new
 And after having spent the day together
 Hold each other close the whole night through

 What happy times together we'd be spending
 I wish that every kiss was never ending

.                    F
 Oh, wouldn't it be nice

;bridge (guitar repeats first two bars of intro):
.Dmaj7       Gmaj7                                F#m7          Bm7
 Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
.Dmaj7            Gmaj7                          F#m7      Bm7
 Maybe then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
.             F#m7                 Bm7
 We could be married (we could be married)
.F#m7                C7
 - last two bars of intro -
 And then we'd be happy (then we'd be happy)
.                  F
 Oh, wouldn't it be nice

;coda:

 (slow down)

.Dm7/A                         Cm7/F
 You know it seems the more we talk about it
.Dm7/A                     Am7      Gm7
 It only makes it worse to live without it
.         Am7    Gm7   C7
 But lets talk about it

 (resume original tempo)

.                F
 Wouldn't it be nice

 Good night, baby
 Sleep tight, baby... (fade)</lyrics>

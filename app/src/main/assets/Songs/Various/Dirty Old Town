.         E
 I met my love by the gasworks door;
.          A                  E
 Dreamed a dream by the old canal.
.          C#m                E
 Kissed my boy by the factory wall.
.          F#m   B7         C#m
 Dirty old town,  dirty old town.

 The moon is shifting behind a cloud,
 Cats are crawling all along the beat,
 Springs a girl in the streets at night.
 Dirty old town, dirty old town.

 I heard a whistle coming from the docks
 And a train set the night on fire,
 Smelled the spring on a smoke-filled air.
 Dirty old town, dirty old town.

 I'm gonna get me a nice sharp axe,
 Shining steel tempered in a fire,
 Cut you down like an old dead tree,
 Dirty old town, dirty old town.</lyrics>

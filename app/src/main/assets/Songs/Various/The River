.F#m                  A             E                  D
 I come from down the valley where  Mister when you're young
.     F#m             A        D              A
 They bring you up to do just like your daddy done
.       D                               A            F#m
 Me and Mary we met in high school When she was just seventeen
.     E                              D
 We'd ride out of the valley down to where the fields were green.

;Chorus
.        F#m         A         E                   D
 We'd go down to the river and into the river we'd dive
.   F#m         A          E     D
 Oh down to the river we'd ride. 

.     F#m        A            E                    D
 Then I got Mary pregnant and man that was all she wrote
.    F#m               A                     D                   A
 And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
.D                                      A            E      F#m
 We went down to the courthouse and the judge put it all to rest
.E                         F#m                    A                  D
 No wedding day smiles, no walk down the isles No flowers no wedding dress

;Chorus

.  F#m                  A                 E            D
 I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
.    F#m                     A              D                 A
 But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
.    D
 Now all them things that seemed so important
.                 A                       F#m
 Well mister they vanished right into the air
.      E                                  D
 Now I act like I don't remember and Mary acts like she don't care
.      F#m                         A
 But I remember us riding in my brothers car
.         E                       D
 Her body tan and wet down by the reservoir
.   F#m                     A                      D
 At night on them banks I'd lie awake and pull her close just to feel
.      A
 every breath she'd take
.          D                                   A               F#m
 Now those memories come back to haunt me they haunt me like a curse
.     E                                    D
 Is a dream a lie if it don't come true or is it something worse
.              F#m
 that sends me down....

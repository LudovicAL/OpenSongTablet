.A                       D
 I took a course in Hallelujah
.A                                D
   I went to night school for the blues
.A                                  D
  I took some stuff they said would cool ya, heh hah
.A                               D
  But nothing seemed to light my fuse

.            F#m        B           D                   E
 But it's all in the past like a check that's in the mail
.                F#m         B
 She was a tall whiskey glass
.            D                                          E
 I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail

.                    D       A       E                B
 Until I met a   blind man who taught me how to see, yeah
.D         A             E
   A blind man who could change night into day
.            D    A              E                  B
 And if-a    I can, I'm gonna make you come with me, yeah
.           D
 Cause a-here comes the sun and we'll be chasin' all the clouds away

.B                               E   F#
  Some thing are never what they seem
.A                           D      F#m
  My heaven's turned into a landslide
.B                                A  G
  Thank God I woke up from that dream

.           D       A       E                B
 I met a   blind man who taught me how to see, yeah
.D         A             E
     Blind man who could change night into day
.            D    A              E                  B
 And if-a    I can, I'm gonna make you come with me, yeah
.           D
 Because a-here comes the sun and we'll be chasin' all the clouds away

.E                 F#m        E                     D
   So please chase harder and drink all the flowers dry
.            E                    F#m
 We'll be savin' us a little money
.          G                                           A
 And if that doesn't do it, yeah, I know the reason why

.                                                D
 Don't make no sense lightin' candles, ah        
.B                                   A     G
  There's too much moonlight in your eyes  

.           E       B       F#               C#
 I met a   blind man who taught me how to see, yeah
.E         B             F#
     Blind man who could change night into day
.            E    B              F#                 C#
 And if-a    I can, I'm gonna make you come with me, oh oh oh oh yeah

.                E
 Because a-here comes the sun, ain't no surprise
 Ain't no doubt about it, gonna open up my eyes</lyrics>

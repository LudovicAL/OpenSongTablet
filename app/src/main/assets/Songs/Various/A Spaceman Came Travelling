;Intro:
.Dm      C      Bb      Dm      F      Bb      C       Dm      Am      Bb
                                                                       
.Dm      F      C      Bb      Bb      C      Dm
                                              

.  Dm              F               C           Dm
 A spaceman came trav'ling on his ship from a-far,
.       F              C             Bb                C
 'twas light years of time since his mission did start 
.    Dm     Am         Bb            Dm
 and over a village he halted his craft,
.       F            C         Bb                C
 and it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star.

 He followed a light and came down to a shed
 where a mother and child were laying on a bed.
 A bright light of silver shone round his head,
 and he had the face of an angel and they were afraid.

 Then the stranger spoke, he said "do not fear
 come from a planet a long way from here
 and I bring a message fro mankind to hear",
 and suddenly the sweetest music filled the air.

[C]
.Dm   Bb C    Dm       Am        Bb        Dm
  and it went la la la la, la la la, la la la
.F        C         Bb    C     Dm        Am        Bb        Dm
 la la la la, la la la,         la, la la la, la la la, la la la
. F              C          Bb      C            Dm       Bb   C
 peace and good will to all men and love for the child.        
.Dm       Am        Bb        Dm
 la la la la, la la la, la la la
.F        C         Bb    C    Dm        Am        Bb        Dm
 la la la la, la la la,        la, la la la, la la la, la la la
.F        C          Bb    Dm
 la la la la, la la la.

 This lovely music went trembling through the ground
 And many were wakened on hearing the sound.
 And trav'lers on the road the village were found
 by the light of that ship in the sky which shone around.

 And just before dawn at the paling of the sky
 The stranger returned and said now I must fly
 When two thousand years of your time has gone by
 The song will begin once again to a baby's cry.

;Chorus, but last line
 Peace and go will to all men and love for the child.

.Dm           Bb                 C   Dm    Am          Bb          Dm
 Oh the whole world is waiting,            waiting for that song again
.F                    C              Bb
 there are thousands standing on the edge of the world
.Dm            Am                    Bb              D
 and a star is moving somewhere, the time is nearly hmere,
.     F            C         Bb            C  D
 this song will begin once again to a baby's cmry.</lyrics>

.F
 Strangers in the night exchanging glances
 Wond'ring in the night what were the chances
.                     F/A        Abdim     Gm7
 We'd be sharing love Before the night was through

 Something in your eyes was so inviting
 Something in your smile was so exciting
.C11                                  C7   F
 Something in my heart told me I must have you

.Am7
 Strangers in the night two lonely people we were
.D7
 Strangers in the night up to the moment when we
.Gm7
 said our first hello
.Bbm6
 Little did we know
.F               Dm7
 Love was just a glance away
.  Gm7            C7
 A warm embracing dance away

.    F
 And ever since that night We've been together
 Lovers at first sight in love forever
.Gm7              Gm6
 It turned out so right
.C7                   F     F6add9
 For strangers in the night</lyrics>

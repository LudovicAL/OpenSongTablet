.  G                    D
 When I find myself in times of trouble,
.  Em         C
 Mother Mary comes to me,
.  G                D             C  G
 Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
.                    D
 And in my hour of darkness,
.         Em               C
 She is standing right in front of me,
.  G                D             C  G
 Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

;Chorus:
.       Em         Bm         C          G
 Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
.                    D           C  G
 Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

.    G               D
 And when the broken hearted people
.Em            C
 Living in the world agree,
.G                D              C  G
 There will be no answer, let it be.
.    G                  D
 For though they may be parted,
.         Em                  C
 There is still a chance that they will see,
.G                D              C  G
 There will be an answer, let it be.

;Chorus

.    G                 D
 And when the night is cloudy,
.         Em                 C
 There is still a light that shines on me,
.G             D              C   G
 Shine until tomorrow, let it be. 
.  G              D
 I wake up to the sound of music,
.Em          C
 Mother Mary comes to me,
.G                D              C  G
 Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

.G     D/F#         Em
  If I leave here tomorrow,
.F          C                D
  Would you still remember me?
.G           D/F#         Em
  For I must be trav'ling on now
.F                            C                   D
  'Cause there's too many places I've got to see. 

[C]
.G         D/F#             Em
  But if I stayed here with  you girl,
.F            C                 D
  Things just couldn't be the same.
.G              D/F#       Em
  'Cause I'm as  free as a bird now,
.F         C                    D
  And this bird you'll never change.
.F         C                  D
  And this bird you cannot change.
.F         C                  D
  And this bird you cannot change.
.F        C          D
  Lord knows I can't change.

.G         D/F#             Em
  Bye, bye baby it's been a sweet love,
.F            C                  D
  Though this feeling I can't change
.G                 D/F#       Em
  But please don't take it so badly
.F                     C              D
  'Cause the Lord knows I'm to blame. 

;Chorus
.F     C                D
  Lord help me, I can't change.</lyrics>

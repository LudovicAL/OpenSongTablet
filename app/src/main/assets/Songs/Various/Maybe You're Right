.G                  C
   Now maybe you're right
.D                  Em
   And maybe you're wrong
.C                  G
  But I ain't gonna argue with you no more
.     F               C
 I've done it for too long__

.G                  C
   It was gettin' so good
.          D              Em
 Why then,   where did it go?
.C         G
  I_ can't think about it no more
.F              C
 Tell me if you know__

.G                 C
   You were loving me
.   D             Em
 I_    was loving you
.C                    G
  But now there ain't nothing but regretting
.C         G
  Nothing, nothing but regretting
.F               C      G    Eb    D    Em    C    G    F  C
  Everything we do____                                     

.G                   C
  I put up with your lie
.     D                 Em
 Like   you put up with mine
.C
  But God knows
.   G
 We should have stopped somewhere
.F                        C
  We could have taken the time

.G              C
   The time has turned
.    D                  Em
 Yes   some call it the end
.C                    G
  So tell me, tell me did you really love me
.C       G
  Like a friend?

.C                   G
  You know you don't have to pretend
.C           G
    It's all over now
.C            G
  It'll never happen again
.      C
 No-no-no
.            G
 It'll never happen again
.C         G
  It won't happen again
.C       G
   Never- never-never
.C            G
  It'll never happen again
.F           C               G    Eb    D    Em    C    G    F  C
 No-no-no-no-no_-no-no-no-no-no                                 

.G                 C
   So maybe you're right
.D                  Em
   And maybe you're wrong
.C                  G
  But I ain't gonna argue with you no more
.     F               C
 I've done it for too long__

.G                  C
   It was getting so good

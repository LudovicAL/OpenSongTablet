.G             F                 C                G
 This here's a story about Billy Joe and Bobby Sue,
.G         F           C                 G
 Two young lovers with nothing better to do,
.G                   F          C                      G
 than sit around the house, get high and watch the tube,
.G               F                    C                  Bb F G
 And here's what happened when they decided to cut loose      
.G           F       C
 They headed down to old El Paso
.G                 F          C                G
 That's where they ran into a great big hassle 
.G     F                    C                   G
 Billy Joe shot a man while robbing his castle  
.G     F                      C   Bb  F G
 Bobby Sue took the money and run       

;Chorus
.G      F                  C    G
 Go on, take the money and run  
.G      F                  C    G
 Go on, take the money and run  
.G      F                  C    G
 Go on, take the money and run  
.       F                  C    Bb    F    G
 Go on, take the money and run             

.G     F         C                     G
 Billy Mack is detective down in Texas 
.G           F          C                        G
 You know he knows just exactly what the facts is
.G              F         C                   G
 He ain't gonna let those two escape justice  
.G            F                 C              Bb    F    G
 He makes his living off of the people's taxes            
.G     F       C                   G
 Bobby Sue, oh oh, she slipped away
.G     F                        C             G
 Billy Joe caught up to her the very next day 
.G              F                       C        G
 They got the money, hey you know  they got away 
.G                F                       C           Bb  F      G
 They headed down south and they're still wanted today    singing

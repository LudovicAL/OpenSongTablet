;intro,chords seque into verse

.D   Bm D/Gb G   D     Bm  D/Gb  G
 Love , I get so lost, sometimes 
 Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
 When I want to run away
 I drive off in my car
 But whichever way I go
 I come back to the place you are

;bridge (4 riff over all this)
.A                   D/B G
 And all my instincts they return
 And the grand facade - so soon will burn
 Without a noise, without my pride
 I reach out from the inside
.G  A-5/G G-5 G A-5/G G-5 G A-5/G G-5
                           

;chorus (E4 riff over all this)
[C]
.        E          E         A/Gb
 In your eyes - the light the heat
.   A/Db          D     A/D
 In your eyes - I am complete
.   E             E       A/Gb
 In your eyes - I see the doorway
.   A/Db             D        A/D
 In your eyes - to a thousand churches
 In your eyes - the resolution
 In your eyes - of all the fruitless searches
 In your eyes - oh, I see the light and the heat
 In your eyes - oh, I want to be that complete
 I want to touch the light the heat I see in your eyes
[]

 Love, I don't like to see so much pain
 So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away
 I get so tired of working so hard for out survival
 I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive

[Intro]  

.D2                   C#m            E
 Scratch the scandals in the twilight
.D2              C#m        E
 Trying to shock but instead
.D2             C#m          E
 Idle hands all orient to her
.D2           C#m              E
 Pass a magic pillow under head
.F#m         G#m            E B
 Its so much more attractive
.F#m        G#m        E B
 Inside the moral kiosk
.A       E           A     E
 Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight
.A       E           A     E
 Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight

.D2                        C#m            E
 They scratch the scandals in the twilight
.D2               C#m         E
 She was laughing like a Horae
.D2            C#m              E
 Put that knee in dour landslide
.D2                C#m               E
 Take this step to dash a roveing eye
.F#m         G#m             E B
 Its so much more attractive 
.F#m        G#m        E B
 Inside the moral kiosk
.A       E           A     E
 Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight
.A       E           A     E
 Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight

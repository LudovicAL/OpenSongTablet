;Key: F
[Intro]  | F | C | Bb | Bb | F | C | Bb | Bb |

;Verse 1:
.         F                               C
 Well, we busted out of class, had to get away from the fools
.           Bb                                         F               C
 We learned more from a 3 minute record, baby, than we ever learned in school
.   F
 Tonight I hear that neighbourhood drummer sound
.      C
 I can feel my heart begin to pound
.        Bb
 You say you're tired and you just want to close your eyes
.    F                  C
 And follow your dreams down

;Chorus:
.         F      C                   Bb       F
 Well, we made a promise, swore we'd always remember
.     Bb           C     F
 No retreat, baby, no surrender
.     F             C                     Bb       F
 Like soldiers on a winter's night with a vow to defend
.     Bb           C     F
 No retreat, baby, no surrender

;Verse 2:
 Well now young faces grow sad and old and hearts of fire grow cold
 We swore blood brothers against the wind, I'm ready to grow young again
 And hear your sister's voice calling us home across the open yard
 Maybe we'll find someplace of our own with these drums and these guitars

;Chorus

;Bridge:
.F                           C
    Lay lay lay lay lay lay, lay lay lay lay lay lay
.F                           C                      Bb
    Lay lay lay lay lay lay, lay lay lay lay lay lay
.F                           C
    Lay lay lay lay lay lay, lay lay lay lay lay lay
.F                           C                      Bb
    Lay lay lay lay lay lay, lay lay lay lay lay lay

;Verse 3:
 Well on the streets tonight, the light's growing dim
 The walls of my room are closing in
 There's a war outside still raging, you say it ain't ours anymore to win,
 I want to sleep beneath the peaceful skies in my lover's bed
 With that wild open country in our eyes and those romantic dreams in my head

;Chorus</lyrics>

.D E9     G   E9
 You fool  no  one
.D E9                      G E9
 waiting to see If I'm gone
.D E9    G   E9
 so hard  to  see
.D        E9                           G E9
  You are  taking your chances with me 

.     Am                            Em
 If I  find you with some other man 
.    D              Am        Em
 you  know what I'm  gonna do 
.       Am                    Em
 better  run If you see me comin

.D   E9        G     E9
  ah  soon you  will  fall
.D E9                         G E9
  making mistakes like before 
.D E9          G   E9
 when you tell  me  lies
.D     E9                           G E9
 I can  see by the look in your eyes

.       Am                                   E9
 If you  think you're gonna take me for granted
.D                   Am           Em
  chasin 'round with  all you see 
.Am                             Em
  gonna make you live to regret  it

.D  C B
 ah   
.E9        G   E9
  You fool  no  one
.DE9                          G E9
   waiting to see if I'm gone 
.DE9        G   E9
   so clear  to  see
.D       E9                            G E9
  you've  had all your chances with me 

.   Am                                        Em
 Youthought it had you could take me for granted
.    D           Am               Em
 but  I couldn't  take it no more 
.       Am                      Em
 better  run when you see me comin'

 She was sick and tired of country life
.                  Em
 A little country home, a little country home
.                     B Bsus4 B Bsus4 B
 Made her blood run cold
.          Am
 Now her mother pines her heart away
.                  G           D         Em
 Looking for her child in the big black smoke
. G       D        Em  Em/D# Em/D Em/Db
 In the big black smoke

 Frailest, purest girl the world has seen
 According to her ma, according to her pa
 And everybody said
 That she knew no sin and did no wrong
 Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke
 Of the big black smoke

 Well she slept in cafes and coffee bars and bowling alleys
.                     EmG D
 And every penny she had
.      G                             B
 Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes

 Ah, she took all her pretty coloured clothes
 Ran away from home, the boy next door
 For a boy named Joe
 And he took the money for the rent
 Tried to drag her down in the big black smoke
 In the big black smoke

.  G      D          Em
 (In the big black smoke) In the big black smoke
.G        D          Em                      D C D
 (In the big black smoke) In the big black smoooooke
. D  C  D     D  C  D    D  C  D   D C D  D C D
 Smoooooke, smoooooke, smoooooke, oh oh, oh oh</lyrics>

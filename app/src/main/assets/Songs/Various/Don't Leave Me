.               B  AEB
 I'll go for miles   
.              B AEB
 Till I find you   
.            A        E
 You say you  want to  leave me
.              B
 But you can't choose

 I've gone through pain
 Every day and night
 I feel my mind is going insane
 Something I can't fight

.A            B
  Don't leave  me

 A blank expression
 Covering your face
 I'm looking for directions
 For out of this place

 I start to wonder
 If you'll come back
 I feel the rain storming after thunder
 I can't hold back

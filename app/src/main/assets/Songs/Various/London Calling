[Intro]
.Em       Am7        G       Am
                             
.Em                    Am7
 London calling to the faraway towns
.         Em                  G
 Now that war is declared and battle come down
.Em                    Am7
 London calling to the underworld
.     Em                           G
 Come out of the cupboard, all you boys and girls
.Em                  Am7
 London calling, now don't look to us
.Em                    G
 Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
.Em                     Am7
 London calling, see we ain't got no swing
.Em                        G
 Except for the ring of that truncheon thing
.Em                         G
 The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
.Em                    G
 Meltdown expected the wheat is growing thin
.Em                       G
 Engines stop running but I have no fear
.Em            Em7           D
 Cuz London is drowning and I live by the river

.Em              Am7
                 
 London calling to the imitation zone
 Forget it brother, you can got it alone
 London calling to the zombies of death
 Quit holding out and draw another breath
 London calling and I don't wanna shout
 But while we were talking I saw you noddin' out
 London calling, see we ain't got no highs
 Except for that one with the yellowy eyes

 The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
 Engines stop running the wheat is growing thin
 A nuclear error but I have no fear
 Cuz London is drowning and I live by the river

 Now get this

 London calling, yes I was there too
 An' you know what they said - well some of it was true!
 London calling at the top of the dial
 An' after all this, won't you give me a smile?

.Em
 I never felt so much a' like...</lyrics>

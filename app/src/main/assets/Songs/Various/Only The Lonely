 They're gone forever

 So far apart

 I cry
.          F
 Only the lonely

;repeat intro

 Only the lonely
 Know the heartaches I've been through
 Only the lonely
 Know I cried and cried for you

 Maybe tomorrow
 A new romance
 No more sorrow
 But that's the chance - You gotta take
.         Bb            C7
 Is your lonely heart breaks
.           F
 Only the lonely

.D                          G                 A
 In my rear view mirror the sun is going down,
.D                             G   A D
 Sinking behind bridges in the road
.      G                     A
 And I think of all the good things
.     D       A      G
 That we have left undone
.D/F#  Em
 And I suffer premonitions,
.Bm
 Confirm suspicions,
.Em                  A    D A G A
 Of the holocaust to come.

.D
 The wire that holds the cork
.     G                  A
 That keeps the anger in,
.D
 Gives way
.                  G         A D
 And suddenly it's day again.
.    G                A
 The sun is in the east
.     D          A      G    D/F#
 Even though the day is done.
.Em
 Two suns in the sunset
.Bm
 Hmmmmmmmmmm
.Em                         A
 Could be the human race is run.

.A  D  A  G  A  D  A  G  A  D
                            

.Bm                              A
 Like the moment when the brakes lock
.Bm
 And you slide towards the big truck
.    G                  A                 D
 You stretch the frozen moments with your fear.
.Bm                              A
 And you'll never hear their voices,
.Bm
 And you'll never see their faces,
.G           A                   D    A
 You have no recourse to the law anymore.

.G  A  D  A  G  A  D
                   

.D
 And as the windshield melts
.G                   A
 My tears eveaporate,
.D                          G    A D
 Leaving only charcoal to defend.
.G           A            D        A      G   D/F#
 Finally I understand the feelings of the few.
.Em
 Ashes and diamonds,
.Bm
 Foe and friend,
.Em                       A
 We were all equal in the end.

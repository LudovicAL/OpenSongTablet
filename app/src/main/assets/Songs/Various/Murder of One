;Counting Crows

.F#  F#  B   B  F#  F#  B  B
                           

.C#m
 Blue morning  Blue morning
.B
 Wrapped in strands of fist and bone
.C#m
 Curiosity, Kitten,
.B
 Doesn't have to mean you're on your own
.C#m
 You can look outside your window
.B
 He doesn't have to know
.C#m
 We can talk awhile, baby
.B
 We can take it nice and slow

.         F#                                B
 All your life is such a shame, shame, shame
.         F#                                B
 All your love is just a dream, dream, dream

 Are you happy when you're sleeping?
 Does he keep you safe and warm?
 Does he tell you when you're sorry?
 Does he tell you when you're wrong?
 I've been watching you for hours
 It's been years since we were born
 We were perfect when we started
 I've been wondering where we've gone

 All your life is such a shame
 All your love is just a dream

.                   C#m                         B
 I dreamt I saw you walking up a hillside in the snow
.                       C#m                                    B
 Casting shadows on the winter sky as you stood there counting crows
.         C#m           B
 One for sorrow Two for joy
 Three for girls and four for boys
 Five for silver Six for gold and
 Seven for a secret never to be told
 There's a bird that nests inside you
 Sleeping underneath your skin
 When you open up your wings to speak
 I wish you'd let me in

.         F#m                 B
 All your life is such a shame
 All your love is just a dream
 Open up your eyes
 You can see the flames of your wasted life
 You should be ashamed
 You don't want to waste your life

.F#
 I walk along these hillsides In the summer 'neath the sunshine
.B
 I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me

.F#                    B
 Change, chane, change</lyrics>

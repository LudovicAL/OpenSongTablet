 INTRO: Em F#m(w/Ebass) G(w/Ebass)

.Em    F#m7  G    D                  C
 Eight miles high and when you touch down
.G                     D             C    C6 C C6
 You'll find that it's stranger than known
.Em    F#m7   G     D                      C
 Signs in the street that say where you're going
.G             D                C  C6 C C6
 Are somewhere just being their own

.Em F#m7 Em F#m7
            
.Em F#m7  G  D           C
 No-where is there to be found
.G            D                     C     C6 C C6
 Among those afraid of losing their ground
.Em    F#m7 G    D             C
 Mean grey town known for its sound
.G         D               C   C6 C C6
 In places small places un-bound

 Lead  |: Em F#m(w/Ebass) G(w/Ebass) :|

.Em  F#m7 G       D         C
 Now the  squares of moving storms
.G             D                   C    C6 C C6
 Some laughing some just shapeless forms
.Em   F#m7 G      D                C
 Sidewalk scenes and black limosouines
.G           D              C   C6 C C6
 Some living some standing alone</lyrics>

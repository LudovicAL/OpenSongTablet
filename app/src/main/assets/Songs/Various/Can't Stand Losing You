;The Police
;Intro
.Dm Gm Dm Gm Dm Gm Dm Gm
        

.     Dm          Am       Gm
 I've  called you  so many  times today
.      Dm              Am              Gm
 And I  guess it's all  true what your  girlfriends say
.     Dm         Am            Gm
 That  you don't  ever want to  see me again
.         Dm               Am                Gm
 And your  brother's gonna  kill me and he's  six feet ten
.  Bb           F        Bb      F
 I  guess you'd  call it  cowar-  dice
.        C         G               C     Asus4
 But I'm  not pre-  pared to go on  like  this

;Chorus
.  Bb
 I  can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
.  Gm
 I  can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
.  Asus4                                 Dm   Gm
 I  can't, I can't, I can't stand losing  you 
.Dm       Gm          Dm       Gm
  I can't  stand los-  ing you 
.Dm       Gm          Dm       Gm
  I can't  stand los-  ing you 
.Dm       Gm          Dm       Gm
  I can't  stand los-  ing you 
.Dm Gm
 

.  Dm          Am       Gm
 I  see you've  sent my  letters back
.       Dm  Am                   Gm
 And my  LP  records and they're  all scratched
.  Dm             Am           Gm
 I  can't see the  point in a-  nother day
.     Dm      Am            Gm
 When  nobody  listens to a  word I say
.        Bb       F        Bb      F
 You can  call it  lack of  confi-  dence
.       C          G               C        Asus4
 But to  carry on   living doesn't  make no  sense

;Chorus

.Bb9 C9 Bb9 C9
    
.  Dm
 I  guess this is our last goodbye
 And you don't care so I won't cry
 But you'll be sorry when I'm dead
 And all this guilt will be on your head
.  Bb           F        Bb    F
 I  guess you'd  call it  sui-  cide
.    C         G                C   Asus4
 But  I'm too   full to swallow  my  pride

;Chorus

;Repeat chorus - modulate to C
.  C
 I  can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
.  Asus4
 I  can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
.  Bb
 I  can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
.  C
 I  can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
.  Asus4
 I  can't, I can't, I can't stand losing
.  Bb
 I  can't, I can't, I can't stand losing

.Dm       Gm          Dm       Gm
  I can't  stand los-  ing you 
.Dm       Gm          Dm       Gm
  I can't  stand los-  ing you 
.Dm       Gm          Dm       Gm
  I can't  stand los-  ing you</lyrics>

.G                                                 D7
 When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now,
.                                                              G
 will you still be senting me a Valentine, birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
.                                        G7                 C
 If I'd been out 'till quarter to three, would you lock the door?
.               Eb7      G              E7       A7
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when
.    D7    G
 I'm sixty-four?

[C
.Em       D        Em
 Hmm------mmm------mmmh.
.Em               B7
 You'll be older, too.
.Em               Am            C       D7        G
 Aaah, and if you say the word, I could stay with you.
[

 I could be handy, mending a fuse, when your lights have gone.
 You can knit a sweater by the fireside, sunday mornings, go for a ride.
 Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?

[C
 Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight if it's not to dear.
 We shall scrimp and save.
 Ah, grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck, and Dave.
[

 Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view.
 Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away.
 Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more.
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm sixty four?

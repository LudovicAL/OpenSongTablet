;intro: Dm  Am  Dm G

. G    Am            Em
 Oh, life it's bigger,
.Em                       Am
 it's bigger that you and you are not me
.                        Em
 The lengths that I will go to,
.                      Am
 the distance in your eyes
.Em                  Dm
 Oh no I've said too much,
.              G
 I've said it all
.                  Am
 That's me in the corner,
.                  Em
 that's me in the spotlight,
.           Am
 losing my religion
.           Em
 Trying to keep up with you
.      Am                      Em
 and I don't know if I can do it
.                    Dm
 Oh no I've said too much,
.                 G
 I haven't said enough

.                           F
 I thought that I heard you laughing,
.                           Am  Am/B Am/C Am/E
 I thought that I heard you sing
.  F                 Dm       Am
 I think I thought I saw you try

 Every whisper of every waking hour
 I'm choosing my confessions
 Trying to keep an eye on you
 Like a hurt lost and blinded foal, oh
 Oh no I've said too much, I said it all
 Consider this, consider this
 a hint of the century,
 Consider this, a slip that brought me to my knees, pale
 What if all these fantasies come flailing around
 Now I've said too much
 I thought that I heard you laughing,
 I thought that I heard you sing
 I think I thought I saw you try

.    Am
 But That was just a dream
.C               G
 That was just a dream

 That's me in the corner,
 that's me in the spotlight,
 losing my religion
 Trying to keep up with you
 and I don't know if I can do it
 Oh no I've said too much,
 I haven't said enough
 I thought that I heard you laughing,
 I thought that I heard you sing
 I think I thought I saw you try
 But That was just a dream
 Try, cry, fly, and try
 That was just a dream
 Just a dream
 Just a dream

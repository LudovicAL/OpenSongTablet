.E   D    A       E   D    A
                           
.         E                                    D          A
 When the sun comes up on a sleepy little town down around San Antone
.E                                        D       A
 And the folks are risin' for another day 'round about their homes.
.E   C#m                    B        Bsus4       B           A             Bb7      B7   C7
 The people of the town are strange              and they're proud of where         they came.

;Chorus
.            E                          D   A     E   D   A           E    D   A   E
 Well you're talkin' 'bout China Grove,      Oh oh        China Grove              

.          E                                                  D            A
 Well, the preacher and the teacher, Lord, they're a caution, they are the talk of the town
.E                                                            D        A
 When the gossip gets to flyin' and they ain't lyin' when the sun goes fallin' down
.E    C#m                     B     Bsus4            B   A              Bb7   B7  C7
 They say that the father's insane                   and dear Missus Perkin's a   game

;Chorus

.G#m

.B   C#m7                                     F#m7                C#m7
 But ev'ry day there's a new thing comin' the ways of an oriental view
.                                                       F#                    F#sus4  F#        F#sus4       F#
 The sheriff and his buddies with their samuari swords, you can even hear the music   at night.              
.G#m

.B   C#m7                                      F#m7                        C#m7
 And though it's a part of the Lone Star State people don't seem to care,  
.A                 Asus4   A
 They just keep on lookin' to the East.

.C   D   E     C   D   E

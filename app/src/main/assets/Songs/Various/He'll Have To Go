. F                             A#            F
 Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
.                           Dm          C     C7
 Let's pretend that we're together all alone  
.               F                F7               A#   F       A#
 I'll tell the man to turn the juke-box way down low           
.             F                      C7                    F
 And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

 Whisper to me tell me do you love me true
 Or is he holding you the way I do?
 Tho' love is blind, make your mind
 I've got to know
 Should I hang up or will tou tell him he'll have to go

.           A#                                         F    A#     F
 You can't say the words I want to hear while you're with another man
.        A#                                   F          C7
 If you want me answer "Yes" or "No" darling I will understand

 Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
 Let's pretend that we're together all alone
 I'll tell the man to turn the juke-box way down low
 And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go</lyrics>

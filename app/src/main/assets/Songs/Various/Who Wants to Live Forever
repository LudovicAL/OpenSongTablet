.           Amadd9                   Em
 There's no time for us,  There's no place for us
.Em/D Em/C#    G/D                    A                 Dsus4     D
 What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us

.     C        G/B     Am        C        G/B     Am
 Who wants to live forever  who wants to live forever
. Dsus4     Dsus2
 Oooooo.... 

 There's no chance for us, its all decided for us
 This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us

 Who wants to live forever, who wants to live forever
 Who wants to live forever, who dares to love forever?
.Dsus4D                         Em
 Oooooooo        when love must die

;solo:

.              Em                C
 But touch my tears   with your lips
.          Em                      C
 Touch my world   with your fingertips

.    G       D/F#   Em       G      D/F#    Em   Em/D
 And we can have forever and we can love forever 
.Em/C#  A/C#Dsus2  Bb/D
 Forever is our today
 Who wants to live forever,
 Who wants to live forever,
 Forever is our today,
 Who waits forever anyway?</lyrics>

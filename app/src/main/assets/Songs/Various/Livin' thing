. C                                              Am
 Sailin' away on the crest of a wave, it's like magic
. Ab                                              Fm
 Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' &amp; slidin', it's magic

.     Em                    Dm
 And you, and your sweet desire,
.         Em     Dm  Em          F       G
 You took me, oh-oh, higher and higher, baby

.C C C        Am             F
       It's a livin' thing,  
.        D7        G+       C
 It's a terrible thing to lose
.        Am        F
 It's a given thing
.        D7        G+       C
 What a terrible thing to lose.

.Bbm               F               G
 (Taking a dive) (halt the slide)  

 Making believe this is what you've conceived
 From your worst day,
 Moving in line then you look back in time
 To your first day

 Takin' a dive 'cos you can't halt the slide
 Floating downstream,
 So let her go don't start spoiling the show
 It's a bad dream</lyrics>

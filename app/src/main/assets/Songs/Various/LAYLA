 || Am  F G  Am ||	Am  F G  Abm

.Abm                            Ebm
 What will you do when you get lonely
.Abm          G       A        B
 With nobody waiting by your side
.C#          F#          B               E
 You've been running and hiding much too long,
.C#            F#                B
 You know it's just your foolish pride.

[C
.EAm   F      G            Am
 	Layla,  you got me on my knees.
.Am    F     G               Am
 Layla,  I'm begging darling please.
.Am    F   G                 Am              F     G
 Layla,    darling won't you ease my worried mind. 
[

.Abm                   Ebm
 Tried to give you consolation,
.Abm       G         A        B
 Your old man won't let you down
.C#m    F#      B                 E
 Like a fool, I fell in love with you,
.C#m        F#                 B
 Turned the whole world upside down

;CHORUS

.Abm                          Ebm
 Let's make the best of the situation
.Abm      G       A    B
 Before I fin'lly go insane.
.C#m          F#        B            E
 Please don't say we'll never find a way
.C#m         F#              B
 And tell me all my loves in vain

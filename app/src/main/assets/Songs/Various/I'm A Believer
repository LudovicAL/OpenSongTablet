. G                  D            G
 I thought love was only true in fairy tales.
. G                 D               G
 Meant for someone else but not for me.
. C               G
 Love was out to get me;
. C                 G
 That's the way it seemed;
. C              G              D
 Disappointment haunted all my dreams

[C]
.                G   C     G
 Then I saw her face       
.              G    C     G
 Now I'm a believer       
.        G   C    G                G   C     G
 Not a trace       of doubt in my mind       
.        G   C             G                  F             D7
 I'm in lo---ve; I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried.

 I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
 It seems the more I gave the less I got
 What's the use in tryin'
 All you get is pain
 When I needed sunshine I got rain.

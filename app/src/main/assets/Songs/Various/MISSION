. Bm
 For many days we travelled from a distant place and time,
.            F#m
 To reach a place they call the planet Earth,
.             G          F#m
 There was to be a celebration,
.        Bm             A A    G
 On the mission of the sacred heart.

 The planet Earth from way up there is beautiful and blue
 And floating softly through a rainbow,
 But when you touch down things look different here,
 At the mission of the sacred heart.

;CHORUS:
. A                G         F#7
 Watching all the days roll by
. Bm                    Gm6
 Who are you and who am I?

 How's life on earth?

.Eb7 D7
        When all the stars above
.Eb7 D7                          A7
        Rain icy fingers down on me

 On a dirty worn-out sidewalk, sits a mother with a baby,
 In her vale of tears she sees no rainbow
 And someone's singing from a window
 In the mission of the sacred heart.

;CHORUS

 There's a building on a corner, in a city, in a land,
 On a place they call the planet Earth,
 My orders are to sit here and watch the world go by,
 From the mission of the sacred heart.

.F
 They disembarked in 45,
.Bb
 And no-one spoke and no-one smiled
.C                                  F
 There were to many spaces in the line.
 Gathered at the cenotaph
.Bb
 All agreed with the hand on heart,
.C                              F
 To sheath the sacrificial knives.
.            F
 But now she stands upon Southampton dock
.         Bb
 With her handkerchief
.                     C
 And her summer frock clings
.                          F
 To her wet body in the rain.
 In quiet desperation knuckles
.Bb
 White upon the slippery reins
.    C                                 F
 She bravely waves the boys goodbye again.
.    Bb         Bbm   F
 Mm______.            

.Bb
 And still the dark stain spreads between
.    F
 His shoulder blades.
.Bb                     F                       F7 Gm7
 A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves.
.F7  Bb                 C   Dm7 C7/E
 And when the fight was over
.   F          Am7      Dm
 We spent what they had made.
.    Gm7
 But in the bottom of our hearts
.                  F
 We felt the final cut.</lyrics>

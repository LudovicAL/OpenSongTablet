.             A
 I saw her today, I saw her face
.                   F#m
 It was the face I loved, and I knew
.               A                               F#m
 I had to run away and get down on my knees and pray
 That they'd go away
.                    A
 But still they'd begin
.                   F#m
 Those needles and pins
.                    D
 Because of all my pride
.                   E
 The tears I gotta hide

 Hey, I though I was smart, I'd won her heart
 Didn't think I'd do, but now I see
 She's worse to him than me, let her go ahead
 Take his love instead, and one day she will see
 Just how to say please
 And get down on her knees
 Hey, that's how it begins
 She'll feel those needles and pins, hurtin' her, hurtin' her

.E    D#   D    C#
                
.                                     B
 Why can't I stop and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong
. A                                         G#
 Why can't I stand up and tell myself I'm strong

.                     C#
 Because I saw her today, I saw her face
.                   A#m
 It was the face I loved, and I knew
.              C#                               A#m
 I had to run away and get down on my knees and pray
 That they'd go away
.                   C#
 But still they'd begin
.            A#m
 Needles and pins
.                   F#
 Because of all my pride
.                   G#
 The tears I gotta hide

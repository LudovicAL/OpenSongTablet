 Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun.

 If the sun don't come you get a tan from standing in the English rain

;Verse 1
 Expert texpert choking smokers don't you think the joker laughs at you?
 See how they smile like pigs in a sty, see how they snied
 I'm crying

;Verse 2
 Semolina pilchards climbing up the Eiffel Tower
 Element'ry penguin singing Hare Krishna. Man
 you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

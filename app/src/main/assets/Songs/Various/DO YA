.D         A            G                      A
 In this life I've seen everything I can see woman,
.D          A               G                      A
 I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
 I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun,
 And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
 I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
 And I've seen pigs all sitting watching, picture slides
.    G
 But I never seen nothing like you.

;CHORUS
[C]
.D A G G A
         
.D            A       G    G A
 Do ya do ya want my love    
 Do ya do ya want my face
 Do ya do ya want my mind
 Do ya do ya want my love

 Well I, heard the crowd singin' out of tune,
 As they, sat and sang Auld Lang Syne by the light of the moon
 I heard the preachers bangin' on the drums,
 And I heard the police playin' with their guns
 But I never heard nothin' like you.

.D                         A
 In the country where the sky touches down
.        G4                  G
 On the field, she lay her down to rest
.        D             FdGd
 In the morning sun,     
 They come a'runnin' just to get a look, just to
 Feel to touch her long black hair they don't give a damn

;CHORUS

 Well I think you know what I'm trying to say woman,
 That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day,
 I've seen enough of the world to know,
 That I've got to get it all to get it all to grow.
 Look out!
. D                    Fd    Gd                     Fd   D
 Do you do you want my love, Do you do you want my love,</lyrics>

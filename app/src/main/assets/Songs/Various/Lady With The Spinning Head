 Here she comes, lady luck again,
 figure of eight, six and nine again.
. A      D        E
 Aaaah, aaah, my lady with the spinning head.

 Whatever the deal, she won't let me down
 Wherever I go, she's always hanging 'round
 Aaaah, aaah, my lady with the spinning head.

 Lady with the spinning head

 She's been gone, but I knew she'd back
 She's got the rent, she'll put me in the black
 Aaaah, aaah, my lady with the spinning head.
 Aaaah, aaah, my lady with the spinning head.

 I don't mind, she took the weight back off
 Those pretty dice were rolling off
 I'm on top when she's around
 She's been taking me out of town</lyrics>

.A     A4    A     A4
                   
.A                     G                A               G
 Early one morning the sun was shinin', I was layin' in bed.
.A                G               D
 Wonderin' if she changed at all, if her hair was still red.
.A                  G              A                 G
 Her folks said our lives together sure was gonna be rough.
.A                          G               D
 They never did like mama's homemade dress; Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.

.E                     F#m
 I was standin' on the side of the road
.A                  D
 Rain fallin' on my shoes.
.E                   F#m
 Headin' out for the east coast
.     A                                 E
 Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through
.G       D     A          A4    A     A4
 Tangled up in blue.                  

.A                    G             A            G
 She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced
.A                     G                 D
 I helped her out of a jam I guess but I used a little too much force.
.   A                 G                  A              G
 We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west.
.A                G                      D
 Split up up on a dark sad night both agreein' it was best.

.E                    F#m
 She turned around to look at me
.   A             D
 As I was walkin' away.
.  E              F#m
 I heard her say over my shoulder
.       A                              E
 "We'll meet again some day on the avenue"
.G       D     A          A4    A     A4
 Tangled up in blue.                  

.A                  G                 A                     G
 I had a job in the Great North Woods workin' as a cook for spell
.      A                 G                     D
 But I never did like it all that much and one day the axe just fell.
.     A               G                       A                    G
 So I drifted down to New Orleans where I was lucky 'nough to be employed
.A                        G                     D
 Workin' for a while on a fishing boat right outside Delacroix.

.    E               F#m
 But all the while I was alone
.    A                D
 The past was close behind
.E              F#m
 I met a lot of women
.        A                                E
 But she never escaped my mind and I just grew
.G       D     A          A4    A     A4
 Tangled up in blue.                  

.A                    G                    A                G
 She was workin' in a topless place when I stopped in for a beer.
.  A                        G                       D
 I just kept lookin' at the side of her face in the spot light so clear.
.A               G                       A                    G
 Later on as the crowd thinned out I was just about to do the same.
.        A                 G                        D
 She was standin' there in back of my chair sayin' "Tell me, don`t I know your na
 me?"

.E                         F#m
 I muttered something underneath my breath.
.    A                       D
 She studied the lines on my face.
.  E                  F#m
 I must admit I was a little uneasy
.         A                                E
 When she bent down to tie the laces on my shoe.
.G       D     A          A4    A     A4
 Tangled up in blue.                  

.A                G                A            G
 She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
.   A                       G                     D
 "I thought you'd never say hello" she said; "You look like the silent type."
.A                    G                 A            G
 Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me.
.A              G                    D
 Written by an Italian poet from the 13th century.

.    E                 F#m
 And everyone of those words rang true
.    A                     D
 And glowed like a burnin' coal.
.E              F#m
 Flowing off of every page
.            A                             E
 Like it was written in my soul from me to you.
.G       D     A          A4    A     A4
 Tangled up in blue.                  

.A                   G                    A                 G
 I lived with him on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs.
.          A               G                   D
 There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air.
.A                    G                     A                       G
 Then he started into dealing in slaves and somethin' inside of him died.
.    A                G                        D
 She had to sell everything she owned and just froze up inside.

.E                     F#m
 Then at last when the bottom fell out
.A            D
 I became withdrawn.
.    E                 F#m
 The only thing I knew how to do
.       A                                   E
 Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
.G       D     A          A4    A     A4
 Tangled up in blue.                  

.A             G                       A              G
 Now I'm going back again, I've got to get to her somehow.
.A                 G                          D
 All the people we used to know they're an illusion to me now.
.A               G        A                    G
 Some are mathemeticians, some are carpenter's wives.
.A                 G                             D
 Don't know how it all got started; I don't know what they're doin' with their li
 ves.

.    E            F#m
 But me I'm still on the road
.A                   D
 Headin' for another joint.
.A             F#m
 We always did feel the same
.        A                                E
 We just saw it from a different point of view.
.G       D     A          A4    A     A4

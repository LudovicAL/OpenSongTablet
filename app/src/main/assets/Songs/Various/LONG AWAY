.    A                E         D                    A E
 You might believe in heaven, I would not care to say
.    A                 E             D                 A
 For every star in heaven, there's a sad soul here today
.     D                        Bm
 Wake up in the morning with a good face
.E                     A
 stare at the moon all day
.D                        Bm
 Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
.     E                E7sus4
 does anyone care anyway?
.    A                    E
 For all the prayers in heaven
.   D                   F  A E D E7sus4 A
 so much of life's this way

;Chorus:
.A
 Did we leave our way behind us?
 Such a long, long way behind us?
.D
 Who knows when, now who knows where?
.A
 Where the light of day might find us?
.D7               A
 Look for the day.

 Take heart, my friend, we love you
 though it seems like you're alone
 A million lights above you
 smile down upon your home
 Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
 Come let the new child play
 Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
 I'm leaving here, I'm gone away
 For all the stars in heaven
.  D                 F                    A
 I would not live, I could not live, this way

.A
 Did we leave our way behind us?
 Such a long, long time behind us?
.D
 Leave it for some hopeless lane
.A
 Such a long, long way
 Such a long, long way
.                     A7
 Such a long, long way
.A   D            F                      A
 I'm looking for, still looking for that day</lyrics>

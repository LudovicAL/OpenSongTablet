;Crash Test Dummies

.F  C   F        C
 Tarzan wasn't a ladies man
.F         C              F              C       Am
 He'd just come along and swoop 'em up under his arm like
.G
 that
.Am         G          Dm     G
 Quick as a cat in the jungle 
.    F     C         F           C
 But Clark Kent, now there was a real gent
.F        C             F          C         Am    G
 He would not be caught sittin' around in no junglescape
.Am         G         Dm       G
 Dumb as an ape doing nothing  

;Chorus
.F              G              C                     F
 Superman never made any money saving the world from Solomon
 Grundy
.    C           F           C                F
 And sometimes I despair the world will never see another
.G
 man like him

.F   C    F          C
 Hey Bob, Supe had a straight job
.F    F                    F                   C
 Even though he could have smashed through any bank in the
.Am     G
 United States
.Am         G               Dm         G
 He had the strength but he would not  
.F     C        F           C
 Folks said his family were all dead
.F            C            F           C                 Am
 Their planet crumbled but Superman he forced himself to carry
.G
 on
.Am        G             Dm      G
 Forget Krypton and keep going   

;Chorus

.Am G       Am          G          F                 C
 Tarzan was king of the jungle and lord over all the apes
.G

.Am  G        Am     G               F      C      F
 But he could hardly string together four words: " I
.   C        G
 Tarzan, you Jane"

.F   C          F        C
 Sometimes when Supe was stopping crimes
.F    C               F               C                 Am
 I'll bet that he was tempted to just quit and turn his back on
.G
 man
.Am      G          Dm      G
 Join Tarzan in the forest  
.F   C  F             C        F    C
 But he stayed in the city and kept changing clothes in
.F         C
 dirty old phonebooths
.        Am       G           Am         G         Dm      G
 Til his work was through and nothing to do but go on home

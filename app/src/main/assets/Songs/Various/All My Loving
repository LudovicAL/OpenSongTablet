.           Dm            G7
 Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
.  C           Am
 tomorrow I'll miss you,
.  F            Dm       Bb    G
 remember I'll always be true. 
.         Dm        G               C          Am
 And then while I'm away I'll write home every day,
.         F           G7        C
 and I'll send all my loving to you.

;Chorus
[C]
.       Am       C+                C
 All my loving - I will send to you
.       Am      C+              C
 all my loving, Darling I'll be true.

 I'll pretend that I'm kissing
 the lips I am missing
 and hope that my dreams will come true.
 And then while I'm away I'll write home every day,
 and I'll send all my loving to you.

;Chorus

 Close your eyes and I'll kiss you,
 tomorrow I'll miss you,
 remember I'll always be true
 And then while I'm away I'll write home every day,
 and I'll send all my loving to you.

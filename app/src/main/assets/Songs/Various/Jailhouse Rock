.F#  G
 The warden threw a party at the county jail
.F#  G
 The prison band was there and they began to wail
.F#  G
 The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
.F#  G                                 G   A     Bb   B
 You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing 

;Chorus
.C               G
 Lets rock  lets rock
.     D                      C
 Everybody in the whole cell block
.      G             C7        G
 was a-dancin to the jailhouse rock

 Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
 Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
 The drummer boy from Illinois went crash boom bang
 the whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

;Chorus

 Number forty-seven said to number three
 You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
 I sure would be delighted with your company
 Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me

;Chorus

 The sad sack was a-sittin' on a block of stone
 Way over in the corner weeping all alone
 The warden said, "Hey buddy don't you be no square
 if you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"

;Chorus

 Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For heaven's sake
 no ones lookin nows our chance to make a break"
 Bugsy turned to sSifty and he said nix nix
 I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks

;Chorus</lyrics>

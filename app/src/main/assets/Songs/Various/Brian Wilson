;CAPO ON 3RD FRET

.G     D               Am7                     G
 Drove downtown in the rain, 9:30 on a Tuesday night
.        D                        Bm7    Am7
 Just to check out the late night record shop
.G         D                   Am7
 Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, call it insane
.G               D                    Bm7  Am7
 But when I'm surrounded I just can't stah-op

 It's a matter of instinct, it's a matter of conditioning, a matter of fact
 You can call me Pavlov's dog
 Ring a bell and I'll salivate, well how'd you like that
 Dr. Landy tell me you're not just a pedagogue, 'cause right now I'm

;CHORUS:

.G        D             Am7
 Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
.         G         D                   Em        Em/C Em/C# Em/C
 Well I'm, lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

 Well I'm lying here, just staring at the ceiling tiles
 And I'm thinking about, whoa what to think about
 Just listening and relistening to smiley smile
 And I'm wondering if this is some kind of creative doubt, because I'm

;CHORUS

.Am7              D               F            Em
 And if you wanna find me I'll be   out in the sandbox
.Am7            D                      G        F      Am7
 Just wondering where the hell all the love has gah-ah-ahn
.              D                F              Em             Am7
 Playing my guitar and building castles in the sun, whoa-whoa-oh-oh
.    D                 G
 And singing fun, fun, fun

;CHORUS

.Am    E7    Am               E7            Am
         I had a dream that I was three hundred pounds
 And though I was very heavy I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
 I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
 Somebody help me (I couldn't see the ground)
 Somebody help me (I couldn't see the ground)
 Somebody help meeeeee, because I'm

;CHORUS

;REPEAT VERSE 1

 Em  Em/C  Em/C#   Em/C  (Repeat and end on strong Em)</lyrics>

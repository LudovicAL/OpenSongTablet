.              F                     C               F
 Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good
.        C              F                   C
 They'll stone you just like they said they would
.        Bb                    F            Bb
 They'll stone you when you're trying to go home
.            F                     C          F
 And they'll stone you when you're there all alone
.      C
 But I would not feel so all alone
.F         C        F
 Everybody must get stoned

 Well, they'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
 They'll stone you when you are young and able
 They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
 And they'll stone you when you're playing your guitar
 But I would not feel so all alone
 Everybody must get stoned

 Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street
 They'll stone you when you're tryin' to keep your seat
 They'll stone you when you're tryin' to make a buck
 Then they'll stone you and then they'll say "good luck"
 But I would not feel so all alone
 Everybody must get stoned

 Well, they'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
 They'll stone you when you are young and able
 They'll stone you and they'll say that you are brave
 They'll stone you when you're sent down in your grave
 But I would not feel so all alone
 Everybody must get stoned</lyrics>

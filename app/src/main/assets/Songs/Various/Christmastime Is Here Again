.D                                              D7
 Christmastime is here again,  Christmastime is here again,
.G                             D
 Christmastime is here again,  Christmastime is here again,
.A7
 It's been 'round since you know when.
.D
 Christmastime is here again,
.              A7
 O-U-T spells "out".

 Christmastime is here again,  Christmastime is here again,
 Christmastime is here again,  Christmastime is here again,
 It's been 'round since you know when.
 Christmastime is here again,
 O-U-T spells "out".</lyrics>

;Verse 1
.C       G      Dm      Am           G
 Take my hand - tell me what you are feeling
.C      G     Dm      Am          G
 Understand - this is just the beginning
.C          G
 Although I have to go
.Dm          F
 It makes me feel like crying
.C             G                  A
 I don't know when I'll see you again...

[C
;Chorus
.              D             D
 Honey leave a light on for me
.                  Bm                 F#m
 I'll be there before you close the door
.     Bm             F#m           G
 To give you all the love that you need
.                 D              D
 Darling leave a light on for me 
.             Bm              F#m
 Cos when the world takes me away
.Bm                F#m         G
 You are still the air that I breathe
[

.  G              A
 I can't explain, I don't know
.D              Gm
 Just how far I have to go...
.            D
 But darling I'll keep the peace
.A            G
 Just leave a light on for me

;Verse 2
 Yes I know what I'm asking is crazy
 You could go, just get tired of waiting
 But if I lose your love
 Put off by my desire
 That would be the one regret of my life

;Chorus

;Bridge
.A           G                   A
 Just like a spark lights up the dark
.     G
 Baby that's your heart
.     G
 Baby that's your heart
.     G
 Baby that's your heart

;From their 2nd album 'No need to argue'

.A           E
 Lying in my bed again,
.      F#m                  D
 And I cry cause you're not here.
.A            E
 Crying in my head again,
.      F#m                D
 And I know that it's not clear.
.         A
 Put your hands, put your hands
.          E        F#m                D
 Inside my face and see that it's just you.
.         A
 But it's bad, and it's mad,
.         E
 And it's making me sad
.        F#m             D
 Because I can't be with you

;Chorus:
.        A            E            F#m          D
 Be with you, Be with you, Be with you, Be with you,
.        A            E
 Be with you, Be with you,
.     F#m             D
 Babe I can't be with you.

 Thinking back on how things were
 And how we loved so well
 I wanted to be the mother
 of your child
 And now it's just farewell

 Put your hands inside my hands
 And come with me,
 We'll find another end
 And my head, and my head
 On anyone's shoulder
 Cause I can't be with you.

;Chorus

 Cause you're not here, you're not here
 Baby I can't be with you
 Cause you're not here, you're not here
 And back I'm still in love with you.

; Again, this sounds good on an electric-acoustic, using a Passac or
; DI and a bit of reverb - but don't go overboard!
;
; The best way to get the 'muffled' acoustic sound is to cut your
; fingernails and use no pick. Use your thumb and index finger on
; the strings, quickly raking, and your palm to slightly deaden the
; strings.. still, if you find a better way... ;)
;
; Use )5th barres for the chords (A == E @ 5th, E == A @ 7th,
; F#m == Am @ 7th, D == A @ 5th) when it starts getting going.
; Open chords sound good at the start, but once the rest of the
; band kicks in, the rapid raking of the barres sounds better.</lyrics>

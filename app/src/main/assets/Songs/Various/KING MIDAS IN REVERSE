; NOTE:  This Graham Nash song was a hit for the Hollies, but I know it as
; a bonus track on the CD version of CSNY's Four Way Street.

.G                  C
 If you could only see me
.G                       C  CaddF C CaddA
 And know exactly who I am          
.G                     C
 You wouldn't want to be me
.      B7
 Why I can assure you of that
.G                   C
 I'm not the guy to run with
.G                            C
 Cos I'll throw you off the line
.G                       C
 I'll break you and destroy you
.      B7
 Given time

;CHORUS:
.G                      Fmaj7   FaddG
 He's King Midas with a curse   
.C                     G    G/C  G
 He's King Midas in reverse      
.G                      Fmaj7  FaddG
 He's King Midas with a curse  
.C                     G
 He's King Midas in reverse

 It's plain to see it's hopeless
 Going on the way we are
 So even though I lose you
 We'd be better off by far

;BRIDGE:
.     Bm
 He's not the man to hold your trust
.BmaddBb                         Bm7          E
 Everything he touches turns to dust in his hands
.Bm
 Nothing he can do is right
.BmaddBb                     Bm7         E
 He'd even like to sleep at night, but he can't

;CHORUS

 I wish someone would find me
 And help me gain control
 Before I lose my reason and my soul

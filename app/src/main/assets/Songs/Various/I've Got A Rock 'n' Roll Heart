.A F#m A F#m
       

.A                   D                     A      F#m E A
  I've got a feeling  we could be serious,  girl;   
.A                      D                        A       F#m E A
  Right at this moment,  I could promise you the  world.   
.  D                   A
 Before we go crazy, before we explode,
.D                                                              E
  There's something 'bout me, baby, you got to know, you got to  know.

.A      F#m     D   E
  I get  off on  57  Chevys,
.A      F#m     D             E
  I get  off on  screaming guitar.
.A                F#m      D              E
  Like the way it  hits me  every time it  hits me.
.D                          E                         A
  I've got a rock and roll,  I've got a rock and roll  heart.

.A F#m A F#m
       

.A                         D                     A       F#m E A
  Feels like we're falling  into the arms of the  night,   
.   A                     D                       A       F#m E A
 So  if you're not ready,  don't be holdin' me so  tight.   
.D                                 A
  I guess there's nothing left for  me to explain;
.D                                                         E
  Here's what you're gettin' and I don't want to change, I  don't
 want to change.

;Chorus

.A F#m D E
       
.A D A E
       

.E
  I don't need to glitter, no Hollywood,
 All you got to do is lay it down and you lay it down good.

;Chorus

.A F#m A F#m

[Intro]  D   G   D  G

.A           D          Bm                G              A  D A G
 "What's the frequency, Kenneth?" is your Benzedrine, uh-huh    
.A     D           Bm          G               A    D BmE
 I was brain-dead, locked out, numb, not up to speed    
.G                           A
 I thought I'd pegged you an idiot's dream
.G                      A
 Tunnel vision from the outsider's screen
.D       A          D      G         A   A G A
 I never understood the frequency, uh-huh    
.D            A                    D       G        A  A G A D
 You wore our expectations like an armored suit, uh-huh      

.A                D         Bm            G           A        D A G
 I'd studied your cartoons, radio, music, tv, movies, magazines    
.A       D                    Bm                 G          A   D BmE
 Richard said, "Withdrawal in disgust is not the same as apathy"    
.G                         A
 A smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth
.G                           A
 You said that irony was the shackles of youth
.D          A        D       G         A  A G A
 You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh    
.D       A          D      G          A  A G A
 I never understood the frequency, uh-huh    

 (guitar solo):  Bm    A   (x3)
.A A G A
       

.A           D          Bm                G              A  D A G
 "What's the frequency, Kenneth?" is your Benzedrine, uh-huh    
.A         D      Bm               G           A    D BmE
 Butterfly decal, rearview mirror, dogging the scene    
.G                           A
 You smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth
.G                           A
 You said that irony was the shackles of youth
.D          A        D       G         A  A G A
 You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh    
.D       A          D      G          A  A G A
 I never understood the frequency, uh-huh    
.D            A                    D       G        A  A
 You wore our expectations like an armored suit, uh-huh
.G          A
 I couldn't understand
.D             A             D           G         A  A
 You said that irony was the shackles of youth, uh-huh
.G          A
 I couldn't understand
.D          A        D       G         A  A
 You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh
.G          A
 I couldn't understand
.D       A          D       G         A  A G A
 I never understood the frequency, uh-huh

.A                 Am
   I'm not in love,   so don't forget it.
.E/G#          G#7             C#m            C#m7
   It's just a silly phase I'm going through. 
.A                 Am
   And just because    I call you up,
.E/G#           G#7                       C#m          C#m7
   Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made. 
.A                     B9sus4     E        A/E G/E A/E
   I'm not in love, no no, it's because...   

.A                   Am
   I like to see you,   but then again,
.E/G#           G#7                C#m         C#m7
   That doesn't mean you mean that much to me. 
.A                  Am
   So if I call you,   don't make a fuzz;
.E/G#              G#7               C#m        C#m7
   Don't tell your friends about the two of us. 
.A                     B9sus4     E
   I'm not in love, no no, it's because...

.A                    Am
   I keep your picture   upon the wall.
.E/G#               G#7          C#m          C#m7
   It hides a nasty stain that's lying there. 
.A                    Am
   So don't you ask me   to give it back.
.E/G#                 G#7               C#m         C#m7
   I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me. 
.A                     B9sus4     E
   I'm not in love, no no, it's because...

.Am          D7                   G   Em
 Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me. 
.Am          D7                  D/E E D/E E
 Ooh, you'll wait a long time.         
.Am          D7                   G   Em
 Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me. 
.Am          D7                  D/E E D/E E
 Ooh, you'll wait a long time.         

.A                 Am
   I'm not in love,   so don't forget it.
.E/G#          G#7             C#m            C#m7
   It's just a silly phase I'm going through. 
.A                 Am
   And just because    I call you up,
.E/G#           G#7                       C#m          C#m7
   Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made. 
.A                 Am            B9sus4  B A/B B
   I'm not in love,   I'm not in love...

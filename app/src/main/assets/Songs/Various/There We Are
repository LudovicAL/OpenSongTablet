.C6\9
 Listen to me and I'll sing you a song
.                                                       F/G
 and the time will go by till you never know where it's gone
.Bbmaj7              F/Bb             E/A
 Talk to me and I'll tell you my life story
.Dmaj7                 F/G                   G/C
 Walk with me and I'll tell you my dreams of glory
.Eb
 There we are
.Gm7      F/Bb   Csus4 C  Gm7      F/Bb    G/C
 Walking hand in hand,    somewhere on the sand
.       Fmaj7                   Em7         A7-9    F/Bb F#/B
 at the end of the land and the edge of the shining sea

.C6\9
 Drifting through time and space on the face of
.                                      F/G
 a little blue ball falling around the sun
.Bbmaj7   F/Bb             E/A                             Dmaj7
 One in a million billion twinkling lights shining out for no one
.F/G          G/C
       in the middle of the night
.Eb
 Here we are
.Gm7      F/Bb   Csus4 C  Gm7      F/Bb    G/C
 sparks in the darkness, speaking of our love
.Fmaj7          Em7   A7-9    F/Bb F#/B G/C G#/C#
 burning down forever and forever

.A/D                  G/A              Dmaj7                 F/G
 Oh I don't know if I told you but you hold my heart in your hand
.Cmaj7        G/C                  F/G
        And I found out something about you;
.             Bbmaj7      F/Bb     E/A F/Bb F#/B
 baby, without you, I'm a lonely man

.C6\9
 So though I never say that I love you,
.                                          F/G
 I love you, darling I do, Carly I do love you
.    Bbmaj7           F/Bb           E/A
 And though we are as nothing to the stars that shine above
.           Dmaj7     F/G        G/C
 You are my universe; you are my love
.Eb
 Here we are
.     Gm7    F/Bb Csus4 C          Gm7     F/Bb  G/C
 like children forever,     taking care of one another
.          Fmaj7             Em7    A7-9   F/Bb
 While the world goes on without us all around us

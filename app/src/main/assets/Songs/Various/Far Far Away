.              Am               E             Am     Em
 I've seen the yellow lights go down the mississippi 
.              Am             E                     Am
 I've seen the bridges of the world and they're for real
.         F                        G
 I've had a red light on (of?) thr wrist
.           C
 without me even gettin' kissed
.F   G
... 

 I've seen the mornin' in the mountains of Alaska
 I've seen the sunset in the east and in the west
 I've sang the glories ... and passed(?)
 It still seems for the best

[C]
.        C   G        Am
 And I'm far far away 
.        F              G
 With my head up in the clouds
.        C   G        Am
 And I'm far far away 
.        F                G
 With my feet down in the crouds(?)
.       C      G         Am
 Let it loose around the world
.        F               E              Am
 But the call of home is loud, still as loud
[]

 I've seen the parish lights ...
 And felt the silence hangin' low in noman's land
...
 It still seems all in hand

;chorus

 I've seen the yellow lights go down the mississipi
... stories carry on
 And all the ... and these smiles
 stay in your memory for a while
 There still seems more to come

;chorus
;chorus, substitute 'sound' for 'call'</lyrics>

;Intro
.Am       F        C        G         C
                                      

.C
 Someone told me long ago,  there's a calm before the storm,
.  G                        C
 I know and its been coming for some time.
.C
 When its over so they say it'll rain a sunny day,
.  G                      C
 I know shinin' down like water

;Chorus
.F         G               C    C/B      Am           Am/G
 I want to know,  have you ever seen the rain         
.F         G               C    C/B      Am           Am/G
 I want to know,  have you ever seen the rain         
.F      G               C
 Coming down on a sunny day

.C
 Yesterday and days before, sun is cold and rain is hot
.  G                       C
 I know, been that way for all my time.
.C
 'Til forever on it goes through the circle fast and slow,
.  G                         C
 I know, and I can't stop, I wonder

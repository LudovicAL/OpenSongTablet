.Hm                      G
 Help!  I need somebody  Help!   not just anybody
.E7                               A
 Help!  You know i need someone   HELP!

;First verse:
.A                           C#m
 When I was young oh so much younger than today
.F#m                      D       G   A
 I never needed anybody's help in any way
.                                    C#m
 But now these day have gone and I'm not so self assured
.F#m                                 D     G      A
 And now I find I need you like I've never done before

[C]
.Hm
 Help me if you can I'm feeling down
.      G
 And I do appreciate your being 'round
.E7
 Help me get my feet back on the ground
.          A                  A
 Won't you please please help me?
;         ^(riff)

;Second Verse:
.A                              C#m
 And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
.F#m                      D         G   A
 My independence seems to vanish in the haze
.                         C#m
 But every now and then I feel so insecure
.F#m                                 D     G      A
 And now I find I need you like I've never done before

;Repeat Chorus

;Repeat first verse

;Repeat Chorus until last line, then:
.          A                  F#m
 Won't you please please help me
;	  ^(riff)
.               A     A6
 Help me   Help me.  Oohm.

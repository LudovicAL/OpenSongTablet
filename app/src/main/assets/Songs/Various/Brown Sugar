.Eb        C        Ab     Bb   C              Eb        C        Ab     Bb   C
                                                                              

.C                                              F
 Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields, sold in a market down in New Orleans
.C                                           Bb                      C
 Scarred old slaver know he's doin' alright, hear him whip the women just around midnight

;Chorus
.G           C                              G
 Brown Sugar - how come you taste so good   
.G           C
 Brown Sugar - just like a young girl should

.Eb        C        Ab     Bb   C              Eb        C        Ab     Bb   C
                                                                              
.C                                           F
 Drums beating, cold English blood runs hot, lady of the house wond'ring where it's gonna stop
.C                                       Bb
 Houseboy knows that he's doin' alright, you should have heard him just around midnight

;Chorus
;Solo

.C                                         F
 I bet your mama was a tent show queen and all her boyfriends were sweet sixteen
.C                                        Bb                       C
 I'm no schoolboy but I know what I like, you should have heard me just around midnight

 INTRO:  

.D                            D2
 Readying to bury your father and your mother
.D                           D2
 What did you think when you lost another
.D                    D2
 I used to wonder why did you bother
.D                      D2
 Distance from one, one to the other

.D                     D2
 Listen here my sister and my brother
.D                          D2
 What would you care if you lost the other
.D                     D2
 I always wondered why did we bother
.D                      D2
 Distance from one, one to the other
.Bb  C   Bb  C               D D
 Oh, oh, oh sweetness follows

.D                                  D2
 It's these little things, they can pull you under
.D                          D2
 Live your life filled with joy and wonder
.D                  D2
 I always knew this all together with thunder
.D                   D2
 It's lost to now or never lives
.Bb  C   Bb  C               D D
 Oh, oh, oh sweetness follows
.Bb  C   Bb  C               D D
 Oh, oh, oh sweetness follows

.D                                  D2
 It's these little things, they can pull you under
.D                          D2
 Live your life filled with joy and thunder
.D                D2
 Yea, yea we were all together
.D              D2
 Lost to now or never lives
.Bb  C   Bb  C               D D
 Oh, oh, oh sweetness follows
.Bb  C   Bb  C               D D

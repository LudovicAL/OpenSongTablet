 Dance Dance         Dance  (All night long)

 I'm a hard workin man/I'm a sun of a gun/
 I been workin all week in the noonday sun/
 the wood's in the kitchen/ the cow's in the barn/
 I'm all cleaned up and my chores are all done/
 Take my hand/come along/let's go out and have some fun/
 Come on darlin' put a pretty dress on/
 we're gonna go out tonight/

;Chorus

 Well come on darlin'/don't you look that way/
 don't know when you smile I've got to say/
 You're my honey-pumpkin-lover/you're my heart's delight/
 don't you want to go out tonight/
 You're such a pretty lady/ you're such a sweet girl/
 when you dance it brightens up my world/
 Come on darlin put a pretty dress on/
 we're gonna go out tonight

;Chorus</lyrics>

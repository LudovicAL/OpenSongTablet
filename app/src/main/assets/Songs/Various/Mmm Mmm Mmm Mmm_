;Crash Test Dummies
;Intro
.Gm   Dm   Gm   Dm
                
.G#   A#   G#   A#
                

.Cm   A#             D#  A#
 Once there was this kid who
.G#          D#           A#               D#
 got into an accident and couldn't come to school, but
.G#              A#   D#
 when he finally came back
.A#  D#   G#              D#       A#
 his hair had turned from black into bright white
.   B                D#            B                A#     G#
 He said that it was from when the cars had smashed soooo hard...

;Chorus
[C
.Gm      Dm
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm         (x2)
.G#   A#   G#   A#
                
[

 Once there was this girl who
 wouldn't go and change with the girls in the changeroom
 and when they finally made her,
 they saw birthmarks all over her body
 She couldn't quite explain it they'd always just been there

;Chorus (2x)

.Fm                D#      A#
 But both girl and boy where glad,
.Fm                  D#       A#     G#
 this one kid had it worse than that 

 Cause then, there was this boy whose
 parents made him come directly home right after school,
 and then when they went to their church,
 their shock had leashed all over the churchfloor
 He couldn't quite explain that they'd always just gone there...

;Chorus (2x)

.Fm            D#   A#
                    
.Fm            D#   A#
                    
.G#            D#</lyrics>

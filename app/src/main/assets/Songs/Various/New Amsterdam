.       G          Em         C         G
 You're sending me tulips, mistaken for lilies,
.    G            Em        F           D
 You give me your lip after punching me silly,
.G             Em           C               G
 You turned my head till it rolled down the brain drain,
.     G       Em           F                D
 If I had any sense now, I wouldn't want it back again.

.G         Bb          Am            G
 New Amsterdam, it's become much too much,
.       G            Bb        Am             G
 Will I have the possession of everything she touches,
.       G           Bb           Am         G
 Till I step on the brake to get out of her clutches?
.      G            Bb        Am           G
 Can I speak Double Dutch to a real double duchess?

.G           Em          C             G
 Down on the mainspring, listen to the tick tock,
.G             Em         F          D
 Clock all the faces that move in on your block,
.G             Em          C                 G
 Twice shy and dog tired because you've been bitten,
.G              Em      F                  D
 Everything you say now sounds like it was ghost written.

.G         Bb          Am            G
 New Amsterdam, it's become much too much,
.       G            Bb        Am             G
 Will I have the possession of everything she touches,
.       G           Bb           Am         G
 Till I step on the brake to get out of her clutches?
.      G            Bb         Am          G
 Can I speak Double Dutch to a real double duchess?

.         E               E           A             E
 Like, in London, they'll take you to heart after a little while,
.         E             E             C            D     C G D
 Though I look right at home, I still feel like an exile.

.G         Em           C           G
 Somehow I found myself down at the dockside,
.G                  Em          F             D
 Thinking about the old days of Liverpool and Rotherhithe,
.G           Em         C           G
 Transparent people who live on the other side,
.G        Em           F           D
 Living a life that is almost like suicide,

.G         Bb          Am            G
 New Amsterdam, it's become much too much,
.       G            Bb        Am             G
 Will I have the possession of everything she touches,
.       G           Bb           Am         G
 Till I step on the brake to get out of her clutches?
.      G            Bb         Am          G
 Can I speak Double Dutch to a real double duchess?</lyrics>

.         Bm                 A
 Love is blindness, I don't want to see
.           G               Em
 Won't you wrap the night around me
.Bm          F#          Bm
 Take my heart, love is blindness

 In a parked car, in a crowded street
 You see your love made complete
 Thread is ripping, the knot is slipping, love is blindness

 Love is clockworks, and cold steel
 Fingers too numb to feel
 Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle, love is blindness

 Love is blindness, I don't want to see
 Won't you wrap the night around me
 Oh my love, blindness

.          C               G/B
 A little death, without mourning
.    F#           Bm
 No call, and no warning
.           C          G/B
 Baby... a dangerous idea
.        F#
 That almost makes sense

.      Bm A G Em Bm F# Bm
 Solo:            

 Love is drowning in a deep well
 All the secrets and no one to tell
 Take the money, honey, blindness

 Love is blindness, I don't want to see
 Won't you wrap the night around me
 Oh my love, blindness

.     Bm A G Em Bm F# Bm

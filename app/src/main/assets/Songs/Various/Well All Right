.F#E F#  F#E F#
             

.         F#        E         F#
 Well all right, so I'm being foolish.
.         F#         E      F#
 Well all right, let people know
.          F#         E      F#
 About the dreams and wishes you wish
.       F#             E          F#
 In the night when the lights are low.

.         B               C#
 Well all right, well all right,
.      F#       E         F#
 We'll live and love with all our might.
.         B               C#
 Well all right, well all right,
.    F#       E         F#
 Our lifetime love will be all right.

 Well all right, so I'm going steady.
.         F#         E      F#
 It's all right when people say
.           F#      E             F#
 That those foolish kids can't be ready
.        F#        E           F#
 For the love that comes their way.

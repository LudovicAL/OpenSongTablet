;Intro
.Em C  Am7C    Em C  Am7C
                        
 Wow!
.Em                  C                 Am7         C
 Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise.
.Em               C          A              C
 Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice
.       Em                      C                      Am7                       C
 With a step to your left and a flick to the right You catch that mirror way out west
.Em              C                     A                        C      Em
 You know you're something special and you look like you're the best.  

;Chorus
.E           B           D             A
 Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand.
.E              B              D               A
 Just like that river twisting through a dusty land.
.E            B                 D                 A
 And when she shines she really shows you all she can
.E      B          D             A
 Oh Rio Rio dance across the Rio Grande.

 I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on T.V.
 Two, of a billion stars, it means so much to me
 Like a birthday or a pretty view
 But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

;Chorus

;Saxsolo over ||: C#m  A   F#  A :||

.Em             C                    Am7            C
 Hey now (wow), look at that. Did he really run you down?
.       Em                    C             A                      C                Em
 At the end of the drive, the lawmen arrive you make me feel  alive   alive   alive 

.C            Am7           C             Em
 I'll take my chance 'cause luck is on my side
.                       C
 I tell you something I know what you're thinking
.  A                     C                       E
 I tell you something, I know what you're thinking

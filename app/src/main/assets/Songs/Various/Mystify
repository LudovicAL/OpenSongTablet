.              Dm     Am
 All veils and misty  
.           G     F
 Streets of blue  
.       Dm     Am
 Almond looks  
.             G     F
 That chill divine  
.            Dm      Am
 Some silken moment  
.           G     F
 Goes on forever  
.          Dm             Am       G     F
 And we're leaving broken hearts behind  

;Chorus
.     Am
 Mystify
.C       G
 Mystify me
.     Am
 Mystify
.C       G
 Mystify me

 I need perfection
 Some twisted selection
 That tangles me
 To keep me alive

 In all that exists
 None have your beauty
 I see your face
 I will survive

;Bridge
.Em                      G
 Eternally wild with the power
.   Em                     G
 To make every moment come alive
.          Em                    G
 All those stars that shine upon you
.     Em             G
 Will kiss you every night

 All veils and misty
 Streets of blue
 Almond looks
 That chill divine

 Some silken moment
 Goes on forever
 And we're leaving
 Yeah we're leaving broken hearts behind

;Intro
.A         F#m        D        A          F#m          E
                                                       
.             A                                   F#m
 So you're in love with someone else, someone who burns within your soul
.       D            E              A
 And it looks like I am the last to know
.              A                              F#m
 I hear you've never felt so alive, so much desire beyond control
.       D       E              A
 And as usual I am the last to know

.            A                                    F#m
 The last to know how you're feeling, the last to know where you are
.            D                              E
 The last to know if you're happy, or if he treating you like I treated you
.           D/A                        A
 Or if he's cruel, I'll be the last to know

.             A                                  F#m
 We spent the summer out beyond the bay, and you said these are such perfect days
.           D                                        A
 But if the bomb drops baby I want to be the last to know
.               A                                        F#m
 But now you're living up behind the hill, and though we share the same city and feel the same sun
.          D           E                    A
 When your winter comes I'll be the last to know

.            A                                    F#m
 The last to know how you're feeling, the last to know where you are
.            D                                    E
 The last to know if you're happy now, or if he's pleading with you like I pleaded with you
.                    D/A            A
 Don't let me be the last to know   

;Bridge
.Bm             E                        Bm        A
 Creations gone crazy that ain't so bad  TV's gone mad that ain't so crazy
.Bm                                    A
 Now you're the only sane thing that I have

;Instrumental - same as intro

.               A                                    F#m
 Always last to know how you're feeling, the last to know where you are
.            D                                E
 The last to know if you're happy, or if he's cheating on you like I cheated on you
.            D/A      A
 Oh oh oh oh ohh      you were the last to know</lyrics>

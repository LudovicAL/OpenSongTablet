. C          F     C    Dm   C G
 any's the time I've been mistaken
.    Am     E       Am
 and many times confused
.C       F  C    Dm  C  G  E
 Yes and often felt forsaken
.     Am    E    Am
 and certainly misused
.     F   G              F    C
 But I'm all right, I'm all right
.          F  C G      Am
 I'm just weary to my bones
.D            G     G7
 Still, you don't expect to be
.C      G   D     G
 bright and bon vivant
.C  F   C  G   G7 G  Am
 So far away from home
.F   C    G         C
 So far away from home

 And I don't know a soul
 who's not been battered
 I don't have a friend who
 feels at ease
 I don't know a dream that's
 not been shattered
 or driven to its knees
 But it's all right, it's all right
 We've lived so well so long
 Still when I think of the road
 We're travelling on
 I wonder what went wrong
 I can't help it, I wonder
 what went wrong

.C
 And I dreamed I was dying
.                       G
 And I dreamed that my soul
.           Am
 rose unexpectedly
.       D           G
 And looking back down at me
.   F           C  G
 Smiled reassuringly
.                      C
 And I dreamed I was flying
.           G        G
 And high above my eyes
.        Am
 could clearly see
.      D7          G
 The statue of liberty
.    F     C     G
 Sailing away to sea
.                     C
 And I dreamed I was Flying

 We come on the ship they call
 The Mayflower
 We come on the ship that
 sailed the moon
 We come in the age's most
 uncertain hour
 And sing an american tune
 But it's all right, it's all right
 You can't be forever blessed
 Still tomorrow's going to be
 another working day
 And I'm trying to get some rest
 That's all I'm trying to get
 some rest.</lyrics>

.       A/D           D                C/F
 Now if all my golden moments could be rolled into one
.           D                   A/D      C/D
 they would shine just like the sun on a summer day
.D   G     Em7    A7sus4 A#dim7    Bm              C/D
 And after it was over    we could have it back again
.D    G      Em7    A7sus4 A#dim7     Bm               D/E E      D/E E
 with credit to the editor        for striking out the rain, very clean
.    G      Em7    A7sus4 A#dim7          Bm              Csus2
 And all it really needed         was the proper point of view
.C/F                     A/D   C/F                    C/D
 No one's gonna bring me down. No one's gonna stop me now

.       A/D           D             C/F
 Now I gathered up my sorrows and I sold them all for gold
.      D               A/D        C/D              D
 and I gathered up the gold and I threw it all away
.D  G        Em7   A7sus4 A#dim7   Bm           C/D D
 It all went for a good time and a song, come on
.D    G      Em7    A7sus4 A#dim7     Bm             D/E E      D/E E
 But laughter was like music;  it did float my soul along for a while
.    G      Em7    A7sus4 A#dim7          Bm          Csus2
 And all it really needed was the proper point of view
.C/F                     A/D   C/F                    C/D
 No one's gonna reach me here. No one's gonna know I'm gone

.         A/D             D           C/F
 You may think I might be crazy and I guess you might be right
.      D              A/D           C/D
 but I know the way I feel today is out of sight
.D G      Em7        A7sus4 A#dim7    Bm              C/D D
 I do not trust your senses        to remember your name
.    G      Em7     A7sus4 A#dim7            Bm              D/E E D/E E
 Without corrective lenses        things are never twice the same
.    G      Em7    A7sus4 A#dim7          Bm          Csus2
 And all it really needed was the proper point of view
.C/F                     A/D   C/F                    A/D
 No one's gonna bring me down. No one's gonna stop me now.
.C/F                     A/D   C/F                    A/D
 No one's gonna reach me here. No one's gonna know I'm gone.

.G                 D/F#       Em        D/F#
 Lately I've been  running on faith     
.G               D/F#     Em     G7
 What else can a poor boy do     
.       C                           D
 But my world will be right         
.                     G     C     D    D7
 When Love comes over me               

.G                D/F#          Em         D/F#
 Lately I've been talking in my sleep      
.G                        D/F#    Em        G7
 I can't imaging what I'd have to say       
.          C                          D
 Except my world wouldn't be right    
.                          G     C   G       G7
 When Love comes back your way               

 chorus
.C           B7
 I've always been
.Em     G7                 C       C/B
 One to take each and everyday     
.A
 seems like by now
.                  C                     D      D7
 I find a love who cares, cares just for me     

 Then we'd  go running on faith
 All of our dreams would come true
 And our world will be right
 When Love comes over me and you

 Solo: chords as in verse 2

 Chorus

.G            D/F#       Em        D/F#
 Then we'd go running on faith     
.G          D/F#              Em      G7
 All of our dreams would come true    
.        C                            D
 And our world will be right          
.                             F          C      break
 When Love comes over me with you

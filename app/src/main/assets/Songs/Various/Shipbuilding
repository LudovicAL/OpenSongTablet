.Am C D D
      
.Em      Em/D#
 Is it worth it
.Em/D         C#dim                  D
 A new winter coat and shoes for the wife
.Dm            Cm7                 D
 And a bicycle on the boy's birthday
.                            G
 It's just a rumour that was spread around town
.C                D
 By the women and children
.              G
 Soon we'll be shipbuilding

.Em     Em/D#
 Well I ask you
.Em/D          C#dim                        D
 The boy said "Dad they're going to make me to task
.Dm          Cm7             D
 But I'll be back by christmas"
.                            G
 It's just a rumour that was spread around town
.Cmaj7              D
 Somebody said that someone got filled in
.Cmaj7           D
 For saying that people get killed in
.Cmaj7         D                G
 The result of this shipbuilding
 nc           G7
 With all the will in the world
.           Eb6
 Diving for dear life
.D                G
 When we could be diving for pearls

.Em Em/D# Em/D C#dim

.D Dm Cm7

.D                           G
 It's just a rumour that was spread around town
.Cmaj7           D
 A telegram or a picture postcard
.Cmaj7                      D
 Within weeks they'll be re-opening the shipyards
.Cmaj7             D
 And notifying the next of kin
.G
 Once again
.               G7
 It's all we're skilled in
.           Eb6         D G
 We will be shipbuilding
.             Gm
 With all the will in the world
.           Eb6      D D D
 Diving for dear life
.D                Em
 When we could be diving for pearls
.Em/D# Em/D C#dim

.               G7
 It's all we're skilled in

 We will be shipbuilding
.             Gm
 With all the will in the world
.           Eb6      D D D
 Diving for dear life
.D                D                D D
 When we could be diving for pearls
.D                D                D D
 When we could be diving for pearls
.D                   Em

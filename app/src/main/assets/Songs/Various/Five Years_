.G                                  Em
 Pushing through the market square, so many mothers sighing
.A                               C
 News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in
.G                          Em
 News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying
.A                                      C
 Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying
.        G
 I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
.      Em
 I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TV's
.   A
 My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
.         C
 I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
.                       Am         C                      Am
 And all the fat-skinny people,    and all the tall-short people
.C                  G       C                    D
 And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
.                                 C
 I never thought I'd need so many people

.G                                Em
 A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children
.A                                       C
 If the black hadn't a pulled her off, I think she would have killed them
.G                            Em
 A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
.A                                                  C
 A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer threw up at the sight of that
.G                                         Em
 I think I saw you in an ice cream parlor, drinking  milk shakes cold and long
.A                                       C
 Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think you knew you were in this song
.G
 And it was cold, and it rained, so I felt like an actor
.      Em
 And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
.     A
 Your face, your race, the way that you talk
.  C
 I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

.       G                              Em
 We got five years, stuck on my eyes - Five years, what a suprise
.       A                                 C
 We got five years, my brain hurts alot - Five years, that's all we got
.       G
 We got five years...</lyrics>

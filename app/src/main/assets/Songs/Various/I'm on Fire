;INTRO: (repeat once)    E  E  E  E  C#m7  C#m7  C#m7

.E
 Hey little girl is your daddy home
.                                      A
 Did he go away and leave you all alone
.              C#m7      A       B          E
 I got a bad desire      Ohhhhhhhhh, I'm on fire

.E
 Tell me now baby is he good to you
.                                      A
 Can he do to you the things that I do 
.               C#m7     A        B          E
 I can take you higher   Ohhhhhhhhhh, I'm on fire

;Repeat intro

.                    A
 Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby edgy and dull and cut a
.E                           C#m7
 six-inch valley through the middle of my soul

.E
 At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet and a
 Freight train running through the middle of my head

.        A                C#m7        A       B          E
 Only you     can cool my desire      Ohhhhhhhhh, I'm on fire

.    Am     F     C     G 
 Go on and close the curtains
.    Am     F     C     G 
 &#39;Cause all we need is candlelight
.    Am     F     C     G
 You and me and the bottle of wine
.    Am     F     C     G
 And hold you tonight... oh eee
.    Am     F     C     G
 Well we know I&#39;m going away
.    Am     F     C     G
 And how I wish I wish it weren&#39;t so
.    Am     F     C     G
 So take this wine and drink with me
.    Am     F     C     G
 Let&#39;s delay our misery...
 
[2x]
.    Am     F
 Save tonight
.    C      G
 Fight the break of dawn
.    Am     F
 Come tomorrow
.    C      G
 Tomorrow I&#39;ll be gone
 
 There&#39;s a log on the fire
 And it burns like me for you
 Tomorrow comes with one desire..
 To take me away
 It ain&#39;t easy to say goodbye
 Darling please don&#39;t start to cry
 &#39;Cause girl you know I&#39;ve got to go
 And Lord I wish it wasn&#39;t so
 
[2x]
 Save tonight
 Fight the break of dawn
 Come tomorrow
 Tomorrow I&#39;ll be gone
 
.Am     F     C     G 
 Tomorrow comes to take me away
.Am     F     C     G 
 I wish that I, that I could stay
.Am     F     C     G 
 But girl you know I&#39;ve got to go, oh
.Am     F     C     G 
 And Lord I wish it wasn&#39;t so
 
[2x]
 Save tonight
 Fight the break of dawn
 Come tomorrow
 Tomorrow I&#39;ll be gone

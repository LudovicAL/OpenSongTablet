.        A           E             A                   D
 Like a bird on the wire, like a drunk in a midnight choir
.         A          E             Asus4         A
 I have tried in my way to be free               
.        A         E             A                             D
 Like a worm on a hook, like a knight from some old-fashioned book
.        A            E               Asus4         A
 I have saved all my ribbons for thee               
.D                         A
   If I, if I have been unkind
.Bm                                    A
   I hope that you can just let it go by
.D                          A
   If I, if I have been untrue,
.Bm                                 E
   I hope you know it was never to you.

 Like a baby stillborn, like a beast with his horn
 I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
 But I swear by this song and by all that I have done wrong
 I will make it all up to thee.
 I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
 He said to me, "You must not ask for so much."
 And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
 She cried to me, "Hey, why not ask for more?"

.        A           E             A                   D
 Like a bird on the wire, like a drunk in a midnight choir
.         A          E            D  A
 I have tried in my way to be free</lyrics>

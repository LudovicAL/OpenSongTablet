.Dm                            Gm                              F

 There ain't no reason for you to declare

 war on the one that loves you so.
.                                 A7
 So forget the other boys because my love is real.
.     Bb       C7    F
 Come off your battlefield.

[C
 Lay down your arms (Soldier of Love) and love me peacefully (Shala la)
 Lay down your arms (Soldier of Love) and love me tenderly (Shala la) Yeah.
 Use your arms to hold me tight.  Baby, I don't wanna fight no more (ooh-)
[

 The weapons you're using are hurtin' me bad.
 But someday you're gonna see.
 That my love for you baby, is the truest you've ever had.
 A Soldier of Love, that's hard to be.

[C
 Lay down your arms (Soldier of Love) and love me peacefully (Shala la)
 Lay down your arms (Soldier of Love) and surrender to me (Shala la) Yeah.
 Use your arms to squeeze and please 'cause I'm the one that loves you so.

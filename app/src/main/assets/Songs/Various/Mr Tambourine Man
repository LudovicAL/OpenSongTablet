.C         D               G              C
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
.          G              C        Am         C
 I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to.
.C         D               G              C
 Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
.        G             C      Am         D         G
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.

.          C                  D           G            C
 Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand,
.   G              C
 Vanished from my hand,
.          G               C       Am           D
 Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
.      C        D              G            C
 My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
.   G              C
 I have no one to meet,
.          G              C         Am         D
 And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.</lyrics>

.A     Asus4     A     Asus4
                       
.             A
 We call them cool
.                  Asus4            A
 Those hearts that have no scars to show
.              C#m          D
 The ones that never do let go
.             Bm           E      E7     E6     E
 And risk the tables being turned               

 We call them fools
 Who have to dance within the flame
 Who chance the sorrow and the shame
 That always comes with getting burned

.        F#m       E
 But you got to be tough
.     D             A
 When consumed by desire
.      F#m       E            D        E        A     Asus4     A     Asus4
 Cause its not enough just to stand outside the fire                  

 We call them strong
 Those who can face this world alone
 Who seem to get by on their own
 Those who will never take the fall

 We call them weak
 Who are unable to resist
 The slightest chance love might exist
 And for that forsake it all

.           F#m          E
 They're so hell bent on giving
.D         A
 Walking a wire
.   F#m             E               D        E        A
 Convinced it's not living when you stand outside the fire

.D           E        A
 Standing outside the fire
.D           E        A
 Standing outside the fire
.F#m         E            A         D
 Life is not tried, it is merely survived
.          Bm          E        A
 If you're standing outside the fire

.             D
 There's this love that is burning
.C#m
 Deep in my soul
.Bm                         A
 Constantly yearning to get out of control
.D
 Wanting to fly
.C#m
 Higher and higher
.Bm       C#m  D        E             N.C.
 I can't abide standing outside...    the fire

;Nice percussion solo (or just play A) then back to the chorus</lyrics>

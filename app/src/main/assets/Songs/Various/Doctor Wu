.Em          D/E        C              D/E      C              Em7        Am7      Bm7       Am7
 Katy tried, I was half way crucified, I was on the other side of no tomorrow                
.G             Am7    Cmaj7           Bm7
 You walked in and my life began again
.Am7           Em7                            D11
 Just when I'd spent the last piaster I could borrow
.Gmaj7     Dm7                Cmaj7           Bm7
 All night long we would sing that stupid song
.Am7               Em7             Cmaj7       Bm7
 And every word we sang I knew was true        

.D11     Gmaj7
 Are you with me Doctor Wu?
.        Bbmaj7                          Ebmaj7           Gm7
 Are you really just a shadow of the man that I once knew?
.        Cm7                 F11        Gmaj7        Bm7
 Are you crazy, are you high or just an ordinary guy?
.              Cmaj7       Gmaj7       C/F              D/E
 Have you done all you can do? Are you with me, Doctor? 

.Em         D/E                     C
 Don't seem right, I've been strung out here all night
.D/E           C                 Em7                  Am7      Bm7       Am7
 I've been waiting for the taste you said you'd bring to me              
.G             Am7         Cmaj7               Bm7
 Biscayne Bay, where the Cuban gentlemen sleep all day
.Am7    Em7                                D11
 I went searching for the song you used to sing to me
.Gmaj7      Dm7         Cmaj7         Bm7
 Katy lies, you can see it in her eyes
.Am7               Em7              Cmaj7       Bm7
 But imagine my surprise when I saw you         

.D11     Gmaj7
 Are you with me Doctor Wu?
.        Bbmaj7                          Ebmaj7           Gm7
 Are you really just a shadow of the man that I once knew?
.       Cm7                     F11           Gmaj7        Bm7
 She is lovely, yes, she's sly, and you're an ordinary guy 
.          Cmaj7             Gmaj7   C/F              D/E
 Has she finally got to you? Can you hear me, Doctor? 
.        C/F             D/E         C/F              D/E
 Are you with me, Doctor?    Can you hear me, Doctor?</lyrics>

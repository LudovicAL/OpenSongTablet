;Intro
.G    D    C
           
.G    D    C
           
.        G                 D                C
 Well, I heard some people talking just the other day
.         G                   D            C
 And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf
.          G                 D              C
 Well I've got some news for you and you'll soon find out it's true
.                G                D                C
 And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself

;Chorus
.        G D     C             G D     C
 Coz I'm already gone, and I'm feeling strong
.       G D               C             G      D          C
 I will sing this victory song,  woo-oo-oo, my my, woo-oo-oo

.    G               D                C
 The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why
.      G                       D                 C
 But I guess you felt like you had to set things right
.     G        D                     C
 Just remember this my girl when you look up in the sky
.        G                 D                 C
 You can see the stars and still not see the light, that's right

;Chorus
;Solo

.        G              D               C
 Well, I know it wasn't you who held me down
.       G               D              C
 Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free
.   G             D               C
 So oftentimes it happens that we live our lives in chains
.        G          D                C
 That we never even know we have the key

;Chorus
;Chorus tag
.        C G     F             C G     F
 Cuz I'm already gone, and I'm feeling strong
.       C G               F              C G     F
 I will sing this victory song,  cuz I'm already gone</lyrics>

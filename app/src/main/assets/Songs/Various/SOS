;Intro

;Verse 1:
.Dmin                  A7                           Dmin
 Where are those happy times - they seem so hard to find.
.Dmin               A7                           Dmin
 I try to reach for you but you have closed your mind.
.F                 C
 Whatever happened to our love ?
.Gmin          Dmin
 I wish I understood.
.Dmin             A7                     Dmin
 It used to be so nice, it used to be so good.

;Chorus:
.F              C        Gmin              Bb       F Fsus4 F Fsus4
 So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me, SOS
.F            C        Gmin             Bb       F Fsus4 F Fsus4
 The love you gave me, nothing less can save me, SOS

.Bb                        Db     Eb        F
 When you're gone, how can I even try to go on ?
.Bb                         Db          Eb      F
 When you're gone, though I try how can I carry on ?

;Verse 2:
 You seem so far away though you are standing near.
 You make me feel alive but something died, I fear.
 I really tried to make it up - I wish I understood.
 What happened to our love, it used to be so good.</lyrics>

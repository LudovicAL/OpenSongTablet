.       EbC#G#
[Intro]     

;Verse:
.Eb           C#              Eb
 Dear Mother, Can you hear me whining?
.                C#                 G#             C#
 It's been three whole weeks since, I have left your home.
.Eb          C#               Eb
 This sudden fear has left me trembling.
.             C#               G#           C#
 Cause now it seems that I am, out here on my own,
.        G#         C#
 And I'm feeling so alone!

;Chorus:
.E                D                   C              Bb
 Pay Attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
.E            D                  C#
 Some call it slums some call it nice
.E                D                   C                 Bb
 I wanna take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
.G#                  Eb      C#   G#
         Welcome to Paradise!     

;Interlude:
;Bass
.C EbD C#
        (12x)

;Other Verses:
 A gunshot rings out at the station
 Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
 It makes me wonder why I'm still here
 For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home,
 And I'm never gonna go!

 Dear Mother, can you hear me laughing?
 Its been six whole months since I have left your home
 It makes me wonder why I'm still here
 For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
 And I'm never gonna go!</lyrics>

;once again, there's a melody line played on the E string with
;the chords, it just alternates between D Dsus2 and Dsus4;
;with the Bm chord, its easier to play a "cheater" chord (no barre)
;then pick out the notes. Or I guess you could play straight chords if
;you're a weenie

.D                Bm               D                   Bm
 Could it be that one small voice doesn't count in the world
.Em                   A    Em              A
 Yellow like a geisha dawn deny it all the way

 Could this be three beaten
 Autumn marches on
 Yellow like a geisha dawn deny it all the way

.D A     G    A   D   A  G
 Shaking through all the day

 Or have we gone way too far
 Taking after rain
 Yellow like a geisha dawn deny it all the way
 Shaking through all the day
 Shaking through opportune
.Em     A         Em     A
 In my life              

 Is that a steal
 Children of today on parade
 Yellow like a geisha dawn deny it all the way
 Shaking through all the day

;At the end, the chorus gets played a key up for a while, so it's
;E     B    A ....    then end on a big 'ol B</lyrics>

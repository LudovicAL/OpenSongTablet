.         G          D
 You need good timing
.  G7            A
 Good good timing

.D      A                  Em       A
 All us people                      
.D              A          Em       A
 Now we're just living              
.G               D         Em       A
 The world keeps turning            
.G             D           Em       A7
 And we're all learning

 Good good timing
.           G        D
 You need good timing

 It takes good timing

 You need good timing

 Good good timing

 We're all going places             
.D              A          Em       A
 Sharing each other                 
.G      D                  Em       A
 A celebration                      
.   G     D                Em       A7
 Of being together

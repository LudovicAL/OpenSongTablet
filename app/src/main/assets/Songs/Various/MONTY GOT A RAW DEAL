[Intro]         

.Em               G                 Em              G
 Monty this seems strange to me, the movies had that movie thing
.Em                 G                D     C          Em
 But nonsense has a welcome ring and heros don't come easy

.Em                 G          Em              G
 Now nonsense isn't new to me, I know my head I know my feet
.Em                      G                D   C   Em  D    C   Em
 But mischief knocked me in the knees so just let go, just let go

.Em              G             Em               G
 I saw the ocean meet the man, I saw you buried in the sand
.Em                    G                D    C  Em
 A friend was there to hold my hand, so walk on by

.Em                G                   Em                  G
 So I went walking through the stream, I saw you strung up in a tree
.Em                G                D    C    Em      D    C    Em
 A woman out there said to me, said hold your tongue, hold your tongue

.G         D      C   Em    G         D         C   Em
 you Don't owe me anything, you don't want this sympathy (waste your breath)
.G         D          C                          D       C      Em
 Don't you waste your breath (waste your breath) for the silver screen

.Em                    G             Em                     G
 That nonsense doesn't mean a thing, they tried to bust you in a sting
.Em               G             D     C     Em
 But virtue isn't everything so don't waste time

.Em                      G              Em               G
 Now Here's a rhyme that you must hear, put this on your reel to reel
.Em                 G            D       C      Em   D     C      Em
 Mischief through a rotten deal, Monty's laying low, he is laying low
.D    C   Em  D    C   Em
 Just let go, just let go

.G         D      C   Em    G         D         C   Em
 you Don't owe me anything, you don't want this sympathy (waste your breath)
.G         D          C                          G          D     C       Em
 Don't you waste your breath (waste your breath) Monty this seems strange to me</lyrics>

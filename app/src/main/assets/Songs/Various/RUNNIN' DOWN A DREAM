.         E
 It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down
.          D                   E
 I had the radio on. I was drivin'
.                                             D
 Trees flew by, me and Del was singin' little runaway
.      E
 I was flyin'

;CHORUS
[C
.         A       G      E
 Yeah I'm runnin' down a dream
.     E           G       A
 That never would come to me
.A            G    E   E          G      A
 Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
.A       G      E
 Runnin' down a dream
[

 I felt so good like anything was possible
 I hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes
 The last tree days the rain was un-stoppable
 It was always cold, no sunshine

 CHORUS

 I rolled on as the sky grew dark
 I put the pedal down to make some time
 There's something good waitin' down this road
 I'm pickin' up whatever's mine

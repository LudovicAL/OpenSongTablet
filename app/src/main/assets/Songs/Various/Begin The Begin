.F#                      A
 A birdy and a hand for life's rich demand
.       E                     F#
 The insurgency began and you missed it   (Intro)
.F#                     A
 I looked for it and I found it
.                E                  F# F#7
 Miles Standish proud congratulate me
.     D
 When the land and sky murders you    (???)

 Life's rich demand creates supply and demand
 Of the powers the only book that matters
 Silence means security silence means approval
 We have Zenith on the TV tiger run around the tree
 Follow the leader run the churn into butter

.D
 Let's begin again begin the begin
.F#                       A
 Let's begin again like Martin Luther Zen
.      E               F#
 The mythology begins the begin     (Intro)
.F#
 Answer me a question I can't itemize
.                 A
 I can't think clearly look to me for reason
.                             E                  F# F#7
 It's not there I can't even rhyme begin the begin

.F                             G  C#
 Example the finest example is you
.F            G      F        G
 Let's begin again begin the begin
.F           G    F G
 Let's begin again</lyrics>

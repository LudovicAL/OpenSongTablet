.Am        C     F   G              C
 She would never say where she came from
.Am        C     F      C       G
 Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
.Am        D7     G
 While the sun is bright
.Am        D7      G
 Or in the darkest night
.       C                    G
 No one knows  she comes and goes

;Chorus
.C   G   C
 Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
.          G          C
 Who could hang a name on you
.C        G           Bb    F
 When you change with ev'ry new day
.G               C       G
 Still I'm gonna miss you

 Don't question why she needs to be so free
 She'll tell you it's the only way to be
 She just can can't be chained
 To a life where nothing's gained
 And nothing's lost  at such a cost

;Chorus

 There's no time to loose I heard her say
 Cash your dream before they slip away
 Dying all the time
 Lose your dreams and you
 will loose your mind  ain't life unkind

;Chorus</lyrics>

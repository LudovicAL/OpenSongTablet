.D         Am
 Desert Sky
.                D         Am
 Dream beneath a desert sky
.                   D           Am
 The rivers run but soon run dry
.                  D      Am
 We need new dreams tonight

 Desert rose
 Dreamed I saw a desert rose
 Dress torn in ribbons and in bows
 Like a siren she calls to me

.Em           G      D    Em        G    D
 Sleep comes like a drug... In God's Country
.Em       G           D    Em        G    D
 Sad eyes crooked crosses... In God's Country

 Set me alight
 We'll punch a hole right through the night
 Everyday the dreamers die
 To see what's on the other side

 She is Liberty
 And she comes to rescue me
 Hope faith, her vanity
 The greatest gift is gold

 Sleep comes like a drug... In God's Country
 Sad eyes crooked crosses... In God's Country

 Naked flame
 She stands with a naked flame
 I stand with the sons of Cain
 Burned by the fire of love
.              D           Am
 Burned by the fire of love
.D   Am

.          D                     G        C         G
 This thing,  called love, I just  can't  handle it,
.           D                    G          C       G
 this, thing,  called love, I must, get round to it,
.        D       Bb            C            D
 I anit ready,  Crazy little thing called love.
.          D                     G       C              G
 This thing, called love, it cries, in craddle at night,
.     D                     G                    C       G
 it swings, it jives, it shakes, all overlike a jelly-fish,
.           D      Bb            C             D
 I kinda like it, Crazy little thing called love.
.              G          C                        G
 There goes my baby, she knows how to rock and roll,
.                D                  G            A
 She drives me crazy, she gives me hot and cold fever,
.           F                             E A
 then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat.
.             D                  G       C       G          D
 I gotta be cool, relax, get hip, get on my tracks, take a back seat, hitch-hike
.      G                     C      G               D
 And take a long ride on my motor bike until I'm ready,
.Bb              C            D
 Crazy Little thing called love.

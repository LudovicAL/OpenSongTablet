 She's the top, she's got the world on a string
 She makes me boogie, makes me do anything, yeah, yeah
.F#m
 Hey now, touch the sky
 You've got a certain kind of look in your eyes

 Well, she's a miracle, she's all that I need
 Like the water and the air that I breathe, yeah yeah
 Hey now, reach the sky
 There's a certain kond of look in your smile

.      D         A        E
 And I know what love can do
.       Bm        F#m        E
 Yes, I know what hearts can do

.B
 The big love - is taking the wheel
.E
 The big love - goes head ove heels
.C#m                           F#
 The big lust bring it into the small world
 the bigger the better
.    B                               E
 Big love, wainting to catch the big one
.                        C#m
 Head over heels the big one
.                        F#
 Bring it into the small world
.                         E
 I'm building the big big love
.    B       F#     E    F#
 I'm building the big big love
[

 It's kinda strange, a bit mysterious
 I goota take it oh so, so serious
 Hey now, touch the sky
 You've got a certain kind of look in yuor eyes

 It used to be so hard, so lonely at night
 Well, she's my baby and I'm feeling alright
 Hey now, move the sky
 There's a certain kind of look in that smile

 When I'm making love with her
 When I'm making love to her, yeah

             It has to be a big thing     
.     B                            A   E
 It's bringing me down to my knees     
.B                     A   E
 Has to be a big thing        big thing

.F                        Dm7
 What do you get when you fall in love?
.  Bb
 A girl with a pin to burst your bubble
.Am7                     D11      D7
 That's what you get for all your troubble
.Gm7                     C7 Bb7F
 I'll never fall in love again 
.Bbmaj7 C7                    F
 I'll never fall in love again

.F                        Dm7
 What do you get when you kiss a girl
.    Bb
 You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
.Am7                  D11   D7
 After you do, she'll never phone ya
.Gm7                     C7 Bb7F
 I'll never fall in love again 
.Bbmaj7 C7                    F
 I'll never fall in love again

.F                       C11  F
 Don't tell me what it's all about
.       C11                     F
 'cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm not
.Am
 Out of those chains those chains that bind you
.G7              C7
 That is why I'm here to remind you

.F                        Dm7
 What do you get when you fall in love?
.    Bb
 You only get lies and pain and sorrow
.Am7               D11   D7
 So far at least until tomorrow
.Gm7                     C7 Bb7F
 I'll never fall in love again 
.Bbmaj7 C7          C11  C7-9 F
 I'll never fall in love again</lyrics>

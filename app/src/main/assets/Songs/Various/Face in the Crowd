;Intro
.Em               C                Em                C
                                                     
.              Em             C
 Before all of this ever went down
.           Em             C
 In another place, another town

;Chorus
.         D                  Am
 You were just a face in the crowd
.         D                  Am
 You were just a face in the crowd
.           Bm             Am                   Em
 Out in the street walking around a face in the crowd

.         Em                C
 Out of a dream, out of the sky
.        Em             C
 Into my heart, into my life

;Chorus
.             D                  Am
 And you were just a face in the crowd
.             D                  Am
 And you were just a face in the crowd
.           Bm                   Am                 Em
 Out in the street, thinking out loud a face in the crowd</lyrics>

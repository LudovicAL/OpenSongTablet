 It's all the same

 only the names will change

 Everyday it seems we're wasting away
 Another place where the faces are so cold
 I'd drive all night
 Just to get back home

 I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride    
.    C     G              D
 I'm wanted dead or alive

 Wanted  dead or alive

 Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
 And people I meet always go their separate ways
 Sometimes you tell the day
 By the bottle that you drink
 And times when you're all alone all you do is think

;chorus - solo - chorus

 I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
 I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
 I been everywhere, still I'm standing tall
 I've seen a million faces
 And I've rocked them all

;chorus
 I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side
 I'm wanted dead or alive
 Wanted dead or alive</lyrics>

. C                            Dm
 They say everything can be replaced,
. Em          Dm              C
 That every distance is not near,
.                      Dm
 So I remember every face,
.Em       Dm                C
 Of every man who's put me here.

;Chorus:
.   C                   Dm
 I see my light come shining,
.  Em      Dm    G       C
 From the west unto the east.
.             Dm
 Any day now, any way now,
.Em   Dm       C
 I shall be released.

 They say every man needs protection,
 That every man must rise and fall.
 Yet I swear I see my reflection,
 Somewhere so high above this wall.

;Chorus.

 Yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
 A man who swears he's not to blame.
 All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
 He's crying out that he was framed.

;Chorus.

 Any day now, any way now,
 I shall be released.

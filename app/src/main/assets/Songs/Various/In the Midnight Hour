 |E  A  |E   A  |

.           E             A         E     A
 I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,   
.                E          A        E
 That's when my love comes tumbling down.
.           E             A        E
 I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,
.             E       A       E
 When there's no one else around.
.           B                   A
 I'm gonna take you, girl, and hold you.
.     B                   A
 And do all the things I told you,
.                 E
 In the midnight hour.
 Yes I am.  Oh yes I am.
 |D    |B    |
 I'm gonna wait till the stars come out
 And see the twinkle in your eye.
 I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour.
 That's when my love begins to shine.
 You're the only girl I know
 That really loves me so,
 In the midnight hour.
 Oh yeah, in the midnight hour.

 |D   |B   |
 (horn break)
 |:E   A   |E   A   |E  D   |B     :|

 I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,
 That's when my love comes tumbling down.
 I'm gonna wait till the midnight hour,
 That's when my love begins to shine.
 Just you you and I.
 Oh baby, Ha, just you and I.
 Nobody around, baby, just you and I.</lyrics>

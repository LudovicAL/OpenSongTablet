;Intro:
.Bsus           A
                

.    Am          C        G          Fmaj7   E7            A     Bsus     A
 You know if you break my heart I'll go, but I'll be back again           
.    Am         C      G        Fmaj7    E7            A     Bsus           A
 Cos I told you once before goodbye, but I came back again                  

.           F#m                 Bm                             E7
 I love you so, I'm the one who wants you, yes I'm the one who wants you.
.Bm E7  Bm E7
 Oh ho, Oh ho

.   Am             C      G         Fmaj7      E7             A       Bsus     A
 Oh you could find better things to do than to break my heart again            
.     Am          C      G         Fmaj7   E7           A      Bsus      A
 This time I will try to show that I'm not trying to pretend             

;Bridge
.Bm                       C#m               F#m
 I thought that you would realise that if I ran away from you
.     B7                        Bm              E7
 That you would want me too but I got a big surprise

 Oh ho, Oh ho

.     Am          C      G         Fmaj7   E7           A      Bsus      A
 This time I will try to show that I'm not trying to pretend             

.        F#m               Bm                           E7
 I wanna go, but I hate to leave you you know I hate to leave you

 Oh ho, oh ho

.E                        A                                E
 I never thought it would happen with me and the girl from Clapham
.                 C#m                           E
 Out on the windy common, that night I ain't forgotten
.                        A                          E
 Where she dealt out the rations with some or other passions
.                 C#m                      E
 I said you are a lady, perhaps she said I may be

[V2]
 We moved into a basement with talks of our engagement
 We stayed in by the telly although the room was smelly
 We spent our time just kissin', the Railway Arms we're missin'
 But love had got us hooked up and all the time it took off

[V3]
 I got a job with Stanley, he said I'd come in handy
 And he started me on Monday so I had a bath on Sunday
 I worked eleven hours and bought the girl some flowers
 She said she'd seen a doctor and nothing now could stop her

[Bridge]
.C#m                      G#m                           F#m
 I worked all through the winter, the weather brass and bitter
.             B                            D
 I put away a tenner each week to make her better
.                      Am                       Gm
 And when the time was ready we had to sell the telly
.                     F                       A
 Late evenings by the fire and little kicks inside her

[V4]
.D                    G                        D
 This morning at four fifty, I took her rather nifty
.               Bm                         D
 Down to an incubator where thirty minutes later
.                    G                         D
 She gave birth to a daughter, within a year a walker
.                         Bm                          D     D  A  E
 She looked just like her mother, if there could be another        

[Verse 5](chords as verse 1)
 And now she's two years older, her mother's with a soldier
 She left me with my drinkin' became a proper stingin'
 The devil came and took me from bar to street to bookie
 No more nights by the telly, no more nights nappies smelling

[V6]
 Alone here in the kitchen I feel there's somethin' missin'
 I beg for some forgiveness, but beggin's not my business
 And she won't write a letter, although I always tell her
 And so it's my assumption, I'm really up the junction</lyrics>

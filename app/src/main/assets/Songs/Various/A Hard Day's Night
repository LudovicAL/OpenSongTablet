[C]
.            G    C9    G                   F              G
 It's been A Hard Day's Night and I've been working like a dog
.                 C9    G                 F               G
 It's been A Hard Day's Night I should be sleeping like a log
.           C                          D
 But when I get home to you I find the things that you do will
.        G    C9   G
 make me feel al---right
[]

 You know I work all day to get you money to buy things
 And It's worth it just to hear you say you're gonna give me ev'rything
 So why I love to come home 'Cause when I get you alone you know I'll be O.K.

;Bridge:
.       Bm   Em                       Bm
 When I home ev'rything seems to be alright
.         G    Em                     C      D
 When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight,yeah

;Chorus

;Solo

 So why I love to come home 'Cause when I get you alone you know I'll be O.K.

;Bridge

;Chorus

.           G    C9   G
 You know I feel al---right</lyrics>

.E    F#m
 Oh, life
.           C#m
 is bigger, is bigger than you
.             F#m
 and you are not me.
.                        C#m
 The length that I will go to,
.                     F#m
 the distance in your eyes.
.C#m                   Bm
 Oh, no I've said too much,
.         E
 I set it up.

.                  F#m
 That's me in the corner,
.                   C#m
 that's me in the spotlight,
.             F#m
 losing my religion,
.           C#m
 trying to keep up with you.
.       F#m
 And I don't know if I can do it,
.C#m                   Bm
 oh, no I've said too much,
.                 E
 I haven't said enough

[C
.                            D
 I thought that I heard you laughing
.    Bm            E         F#m   E A Bm
 I thought that I heard you sing.      
.    D                Bm  E    F#mE
 I think I thought I saw you try.

.        F#m                    C#m
 Every whisper of every waking hour
.                   F#m
 I'm chosing my confessions.
.           C#m
 Trying to keep an eye on you
.        F#m
 like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
.C#m                    Bm
 oh, no, I've said too much,
.         E
 I set it up

.           F#m
 Consider this, consider this,
.     C#m
 the hint of the century.
.           F#m
 consider this, the slip that
.  C#m
 brought me to my knees failed
.  F#m
 What if all these fantasies come
.C#m
 flailing around.
.          Bm       Em
 Now I've said too much.

;chorus

.      A               Hm
 But that was just a dream,
.  A               Hm
 that was just a dream.
.                  F#m    E A BmA
 That's me in the corner</lyrics>

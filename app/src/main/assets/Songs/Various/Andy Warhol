.Am                                           F
 Like to take a cement fix, be a standing cinema,
.                    Dm             F                Dm     Am
 Dress my friends up just for show, see them as they really are
.Am                                                  F
 Put a peephole in my brain, two new pence to have a go,
.             Dm               F      Dm     Am
 Like to be a gallery, put you all inside my show,

;Chorus
.G    C       Dm      Am      Dm       Am    C    G
 Andy Warhol, looks a scream, hang him on my wa-a-a-all
.G    C       Dm      Am           Dm         Am      C   G   D
 Andy Warhol, silver screen, can't tell them apart at a-a-a-a-all

.Am                                           F
 Andy walking, Andy tired, Andy take a little snooze,
.                   Dm           F             Dm       Am
 Tie him up when he fast asleep, send him on a pleasure cruise
.Am                                                        F
 When he wake up, on the beach, be sure to think of me and you.
.                            Dm                       F            Dm       Am
 To think about paint and to think about glue, what a jolly boring thing to do.

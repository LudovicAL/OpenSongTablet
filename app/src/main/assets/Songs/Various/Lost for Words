;Pink Floyd

.      F                       C
 I was spending my time in the doldrums
.      F                       C
 I was caught in a cauldron of hate
.       F              C   Am
 I felt persecuted and paralysed
.  G                                       F
 I thought that everything else would just wait

 While you are wasting your time on your enemies
 Engulfed in a fever of spite
 Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
 Like shadows into the night

 To martyr yourself to caution
 Is not going to help at all
 Because there'll be no safety in numbers
 When the Right One walks out of the door

;break

.        C                         G
 Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
.      C                               G
 Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
.C                   G  Em
 Stuck in a world of isolation
.          D                  C
 While the ivy grows over the door

 So I open my doors to my enemies
 And I ask could we wipe the slate clean
 But the tell me please go fuck myself
 You know you just can't win</lyrics>

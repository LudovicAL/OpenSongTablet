.  G            D
 1  I bless the  day I found you
.Em         Bm
  I want to  stay around you
.C         G
  And so I  beg you
.C          G
  Let it be  me

.  G                D
 2  Don't take this  heaven from one
.Em           Bm
  If you must  cling to someone
.C        G
  Now and  forever
.C          G
  Let it be  me

.  C             Bm
 R  Each time we  meet love
.C       G
  I find  complete love
.Am            Bm
  Without your  sweet love
.C                   BD
  What would life be  

.  G         D
 3  So never  leave me lonely
.Em           Bm
  Tell me you  love me only
.C                G
  And that you'll  allways
.C          G
  Let it be  me

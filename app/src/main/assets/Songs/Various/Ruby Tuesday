.Bm        A     G         A        D
 She would never say where she came from
.Bm    A         G      A
 Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
.Bm        E      A         Bm      E       A
 While the sun is bright or in your darkest night
.       D                    A
 No one knows, she comes and goes

;Chorus
.D    A   D                      A      D
 Good bye Ruby Tuesday who could hang a name on you
.         A           G
 When you change with every new day
.A               D    A
 Still I'm gonna miss you

.      Bm       A       G        A     D
 Don't question why she needs to be so free
.       Bm       A        G    A
 She'll tell you it's the only way to be
.Bm       E        A            Bm         E        A
 She just can't be chained to a life where nothings gained
.             D               A
 And nothings lost, at such a cost

;Chorus

.Bm          A       G        A         D
 "There's no time to lose," I heard her say
.Bm         A        G         A
 "Cash your dreams before they slip away"
.Bm    E       A     Bm        E          A
 Dying all the time, lose your dreams and you
.               D                D
 Will lose your mind, ain't life unkind

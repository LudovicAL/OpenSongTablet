.C                    Dm
 That's when Wendell Gee takes a tug
.  G         G7         Em               G
 Upon the string that held the line of trees
.C                    Dm
 Behind the house he lived in
.          G             G7
 He was reared to give respect
.      Em                 G        F
 But somewhere down the line he chose
.                    C Em F
 To whistle as the wind  blows
. F              C      G                 C
 Whistle as the wind   blows through the leaves

 He had a dream one night
 That the tree had lost its middle
 So he built a trunk of chicken wire
 To try to hold it up but the wire the wire turned to lizard skin
 And when he climbed it sagged

. F                  C        Em F
 There wasn't even time to say
. F                  C G F
 Goodbye to Wendell Gee
.                    C       Em F
 So whistle as the wind blows
.                  C    G                    C
 Whistle as the wind blows through the leaves (2nd time, play F)

.                  C    Em F
 If the wind were colors
.                       C  G F
 And if the air could speak
.                      C      Em F
 Then whistle as the wind blows
.                C     G  C
 Whistle as the wind blows</lyrics>

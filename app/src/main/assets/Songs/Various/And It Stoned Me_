.G                     D                   C                 G
  Half a mile from the county fair and the rain came pourin' down
.             D                     C                 G
 Me and Billy standin' there with a silver half a crown
.                    D                   C                 G
 Hands are full of a fishin' rod and the tackle on our backs
.                    D                    C                 G
 We just stood there gettin' wet with our backs against the fence
.Am     D      Am     D      Am     D
 Oh the water, oh the water, oh the water
.Em                       D
   Hope it don't rain all day

[C]
.       G         C
 And it stoned me to my soul
.G                     D
   Stoned me just like jelly-roll
.       C      G
 And it stoned me
.       G         C
 And it stoned me to my soul
.G                     D
   Stoned me just like goin' home
.       C      G
 And it stoned me

 Then the rain let up and the sun came up and we were gettin' dry
 Almost glad a pick-up truck nearly passed us by
 So we jumped right in and the driver grinned and he dropped us up
 the road
 We looked at the swim and we jumped right in not to mention fishin'
 poles
 Oh the water, oh the water, oh the water
 Let it run all over me

;Chorus

 On the way back home we sang a song but our throats were gettin' dry
 Then we saw the man from across the road with the sunshine in his eye
 Well he lived all alone in his own little home with a great big
 gallon jar
 There were bottles too, one for me and you, and he said, "Hey! there you are!"
 Oh the water, oh the water, oh the water
 Get it myself from the mountain stream

;Chorus</lyrics>

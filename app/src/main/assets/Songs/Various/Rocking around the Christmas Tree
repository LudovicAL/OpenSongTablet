[Intro]                

;Verse1
.Ab                                        Eb
 Rocking around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop
.Eb                                      Ab
 Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop
.Ab                                          Eb
 Rocking around the Christmas tree, let the Christmas spirit ring
.Eb                                                       Ab
 Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling

;Bridge:
.Db                          Cm
 You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
.Fm                              Bb                  Eb
 Voices singing let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly
.Ab                                         Eb
 Rocking around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday
.Eb                                                Ab
 Everyone dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way

;Verse2    inst.

;Bridge (with last line:)
.Eb                                 Eb     Eb   Eb        Ab Db Ab
 Everyone dancing merrily in the new   old - fa - shioned way

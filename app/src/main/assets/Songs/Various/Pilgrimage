 Take a turn take a turn
 Take off marching take off marching

 They called the club a two-headed cow
 Your hate clipped and distant your luck with pilgrimage
 Rest assured this will not last take a turn for the worst
 Your hate clipped and distant your luck a two-headed cow

.C C C    F         G
          Pilgrimage has gained momentum
.F      G
 Take a turn take a turn
.F        G        F        G
 Take off marching take off marching
 Pilgrimage

 C / / /  C(Bbass) / / /  Bb / / / G (of course repeated some)

 Speaking in tongues it's with a broken lip
 Your hate clipped and distant your luck with pilgrimage
 Rest assured this will not last take a turn for the worst
 Your hate clipped and distant your luck a two-headed cow

 Your hate clipped and distant your luck
 Rest assured this will not last take a turn for the worst
 Your hate clipped and distant your luck two-headed</lyrics>

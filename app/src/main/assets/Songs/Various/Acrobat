.       Em7 Am
[Intro]  

. Am                     G    Fmaj7                  Em/D
 Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see
. Am                     G          Fmaj7        Em/D
 If you just close your eyes you can feel the enemy

 When I first met you girl, you had fire in your soul
 What happened your face of melting snow?

.        C
 Now it looks like this
.    Am7
 and you can swallow or you can spit
.         F              G
 You can throw it up or choke on it

 And you can dream, so dream out loud
.     F              G                Am7
 You know that your time is coming 'round
.        F          G                   Am
... Don't let the bastards grind you down

 No nothing makes sense, nothing seems to fit
 I know you'd hit out if you only knew who to hit
 And I'd join the movement if there was one I could believe in
 Yeah I'd break bread and wine if there was a church I could receive in

 'Cos I need it now
 To take the cup, to fill it up
 To drink it slow, I can't let you go
 And I must be an Acrobat to talk like this and act like that
 And you can dream, so dream out loud
... Don't let the bastards grind you down

 What are we going to do now it's all been said?
 No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read

 And I must be an acrobat
 To talk like this and act like that
 And you can dream, so dream out loud
 And you can find your own way out
 You can build and I can will
 And you can call I can't wait until
 You can stash and you can seize
 In dreams begin responsibilities
 And I can love, and I can love
 I know that the tide is turning 'round
...Don't let the bastards grind you down</lyrics>

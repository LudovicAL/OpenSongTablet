.AmAm7/G Am6/F# Fmaj7
       
.AmG D E7
       

.  Am           Am7/G         Am6/F#             Fmaj7
 I  look at you  all, see the  love there that's 
 sleeping
.Am           G          D      E7
  While my guitar gently  weeps 
.  Am           Am7/G        Am6/F#        Fmaj7
 I  look at the  floor and I  see it needs  sweeping
.Am           G          C      E7
  Still my guitar gently  weeps 

.A             C#m  F#m     C#m
  I don't know  why  nobody  told you
.Bm                  E7
  How to unfold your  love
.A             C#m  F#m          C#m
  I don't know  how  someone controlled you
.Bm                    E7
  They bought and sold  you.

.  Am           Am7/G        Am6/F#       Fmaj7
 I  look at the  world and I  notice it's  turning
.Am           G          D      E7
  While my guitar gently  weeps 
.     Am        Am7/G        Am6/F#     Fmaj7
 With  every mistake we must  surely be  learning
.Am           G          C      E7
  Still my guitar gently  weeps 

;Solo on Verse

.A             C#m  F#m         C#m
  I don't know  how  you were diverted
.Bm                      E7
  You were perverted too 
.A             C#m  F#m         C#m
  I don't know  how  you were inverted
.Bm                   E7
  No one alerted you. 

.  Am           Am7/G        Am6/F#             Fmaj7
 I  look at you  all see the  love there that's 
 sleeping
.Am           G          D      E7
  While my guitar gently  weeps 
.Am           Am7/G       Am6/F# Fmaj7
  Look at you  all . . .    
.Am           G          C       E7
  Still my guitar gently  weeps.

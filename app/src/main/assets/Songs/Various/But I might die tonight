.D          C             D                     C
 Don't want  to work away  doin' just what they all say,
.D             C                D                      C
 Work hard boy  and you'll find  one day you'll have a job like mine,
.A             G         A                 G
 'Cause I know  for sure  nobody should be that poor
.A          G            A                      G
 To say yes  or sink low  because you happen to say so, say so, you say so

.D          C             D                     C
 Don't want  to work away  doin' just what they all say,
.D             C                D                      C                                        D
 Work hard boy  and you'll find  one day you'll have a job like mine, job like mine, a job like mine
.A        G            A              G
 Be wise,  look ahead,  use your eyes  he said
.A            G             A            C       D
 be straight,  think right,  but I might die tonight!

;The Pogues

.       F#m E Bm A
[Intro]    

;Verse:
.    A
 The island it is silent now
.        D
 But the ghosts still haunt the waves
.        A                 F#m
 And the torch lights up a famished man
.    Bm                    E
 Who fortune could not save

.E       A
 Did you work upon the railroad
.        D
 Did you rid the streets of crime
.          A                     F#m
 Were your dollars from the white  house
.     E                          A
 Were they from the five and dime
.        F#m
 Did the old songs taunt or cheer you
.        D                      A
 And did they still make you cry
.        F#m
 Did you count the months and years
.                Bm               E
 Or did your teardrops quickly dry
.    A
 Ah, No, says he 'twas not to be
.     D
 On a coffin ship I came here
.      A          F#m
 And I never even got so far
.     E                        A
 That they could change my mind

;Chorus:
.F#m
 Thousands are still sailing
. E                 Bm
 Across the Western Ocean
.     F#m
 To a land of opportunity
.     E                 Bm
 That some of them will never see
.F#m
 Fortune prevailing
.E                  Bm
 Across the Western Ocean
.      F#m
 Their bellies full

 And their spirits free
.        E                   Bm
 They'll break the chains of poverty
.            D     F#m  E B D F#m E B
 And they'll dance                  

.F#m Bm   F#m D   A E  A E A
                           

;Verse 2
 In Manhattan's desert twilight
 In the death of afternoon
 We stepped hand in hand on Broadway
 Like the first man on the moon
 And "The Blackbird" broke the silence
 As you whistled it so sweet
 And in Brendan Behan's footsteps
 I danced up and down the street

 Then we said goodnight to Broadway
 Giving it our best regards
 Tipped our hats to Mister Cohan
 Dear old Times Square's favourite bard
 Then we raised a glass to J.F.K.
 And a dozen more besides
 When I got back to my empty room
 I suppose I must have cried

;Chorus 2
 Thousands are sailing
 Again across the ocean
 Where the hand of opportunity
 Draws tickets in a lottery
 Postcards we're mailing
 Of sky-blue skies and oceans
 From rooms the daylight never sees
 Where lights don't glow on Christmas trees
 But we dance to the music And we dance

;Chorus 3
 Thousands are sailing
 Across the Western Ocean
 Where the hand of opportunity
 Draws tickets in a lottery
 Where e'er we go, we celebrate
 The land that makes us refugees
 From fear of Priests with empty plates
 From guilt and weeping effigies
 And we dance

.DF#m E B

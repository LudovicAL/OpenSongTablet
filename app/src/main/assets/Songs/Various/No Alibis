 Intro  (5x)

.A          Bm      G     D       G                       A
 I beg your pardon, hello darlin, This is me your talking to......
.A            Bm                G                 D
 Sit down and tell me about it, you don't have to shout it at me,
.G             D              A   D
 tell what you really want to do........

[C
.                 G D A   G         D                      A
 Don't give me no alibis, No untrue stories your trying to justify
.              G D A                D          A            D A G D A G
 Don't want no alibis, Just another reason for another lie            
[

.A             Bm       G                     D
 Mountain gets steeper, The hole you dig gets deeper,
.G          D              A
 you better stop and climb out.....
.A                   Bm                  G                            D
 Cause I'm trying to give it all to you, Baby I can see right through you,
.G             D              A   D
 Sometimes you lose what it's all about.......

 Mountain gets steeper, The hole you dig gets deeper,
.G                D             A    A           Bm
 Better reach and pull yourself out, Nobody ever gonna love you
.G            D           G                   D       A     D
 The way that I love you, And I never want to see you doing without

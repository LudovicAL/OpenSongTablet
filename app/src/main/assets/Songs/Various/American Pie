.  G    D    Em7      Am            C
 A long long time ago I can still remember
.         Em                    D         G      D        Em7
 how that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance
.     Am                 C                Em              C           D     Em
 that I could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for a while.

.             Am             Em               Am
 But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver
.C        G-B    Am          C                D
 Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step
.  G       D           Em           Am7            D
 I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride
.    G         D                          C       D7    G    C-G   G
 But something touched me deep inside The day the Music Died       

 So

 bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my chevy to the levy But the levy was dry
.         G        C                  G           D
 And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye
.        Em                        A7  Em                        D7
 Singin' this'll be the day that I die this'll be the day that I die.

.G                 Am                  C                 Am
 Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above?
.Em             D                 G     D        Em
   If the Bible tells you so.  Do you believe in Rock 'n Roll?
.    Am7             C                Em               A7           D
 Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

.        Em                  D                      Em              D
 Well, I know that you're in love with him 'cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
.    C           G-B      A7           C                 D7
 You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rythmny blues
.        G      D       Em                   Am                   C
 I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck.
.    G      D     Em              C       D7    G   C
 But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died

 I started singin'
;chorus

.G                            Am             C                   Am
 Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
.Em                      D                   G      D            Em
   But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the King and Queen
.     Am7              C                     Em         A7        D
 In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me

.        Em                 D                Em               D
 Oh, and while the King was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown
.    C         G-B   A7         C             D7
 The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned
.          G      D      Em               Am                  C
 And while Lennon read a book of Marx The court kept practice in the park
.    G       D      Em              C       D7    G    C
 And we sang dirges in the dark The day the Music Died.

 We were singing
;chorus

.G                   Am     Am          C                     Am
 Helter-Skelter in a summer swelter The Byrds flew off with a fallout shelter
.Em                   D               G      D        Em
 Eight Miles High and falling fast It landed foul out on the grass
.    Am7           C                          Em       A7               D
 The players tried for a forward pass But the jester's on the sidelines in a cast

.        Em                D                       Em                 D
 Now the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sargeants played a marching tune
.C      G-B       A7           C         D7
 We all got up to dance But we never got the chance
.           G       D        Em                 Am              C
 'cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield
.G      D      Em                    C       D7    G    C  G
 Do you recall what was reveiled the day the Music Died?   

 We stared singing
;chorus

.G                         Am             C          Am
 Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation Lost in Space
.Em                   D                       G
 With no time left to start again So come on, Jack be nimble
.Em                 Am7            C                  Em          A7           D
 Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'cause fire is the Devil's only friend

.        Em               D               Em                     D
 Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage
.C        G       A7         C                  D7
 No angel born in hell Could break that Satan's spell
.           G              D      Em              Am             C
 And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrifical rite
.      G     D        Em               C       D7    G    C  G
 I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the Music Died    

 He was singing
;chorus

.  G                       Am          C                  Am
 I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news
.    Em                         D      G                       D
 But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store
.          Em              Am7                  Em                 A7            D
 Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music woudn't play

.           Em                   D            Em                          D
 And in the streets the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
.C         G        A7         C                     D7
 But not a word was spoken The Church bells all were broken
.    G           D               Em      Am          C
 And three men I admire most The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
.     G          D          Em                C       D7    G    C  G
 They caught the last train for the coast The Day the Music Died.   

 And they were singing
;chorus

 They were singing

;verse1
.G                                 C
 I love to look into your big brown eyes.
.                           G
 They talk to me and seem to hypnotize.
.                                   C
 They say the things nobody dares to say,
.                                D
 and I'm not about to let you fly away.
.                                      C                  D
 My lover with no jet lag, were staying up all night in my sleeping bag.

 You got a heart beat rythym from subterean,
.                F
 I   real-ly   Love   You     Little girl, I dont neeeed to explain.

.G                               C                  F                               G
 I love you cause your deuces are wild, girl, like a double shot of loving so fi--ye-ine
.G                                 C                F                                G    F G
  I been loving you since you was a child, girl, cuz you and me are two of a ki-ye-iiiiiind.

;verse2
.G                                                 C
 Ah----------  Like deja v#  I feel like I been heeeeeere,
.                                           G
 Or somewhere else but you've been always neeeeear.
.                                          C
 It's  you that's in my dreams, I'm begging for
.                                      D
 but I woke up when someone slammed the door
.                                    C                        D
 so hard I fell out of bed, screaming mama's little baby loves shorten bread,
.                                               F
 and the moral of the story I can testify; I get stoned on you girl.
 That's the best reason whyyyyyyy.

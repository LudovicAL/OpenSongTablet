;Intro:
.G     D      C       D
                      

.       G     D       C        D
 In the dark 		of the sun      
.         G     D     C          D
 Will you save 		me a place      
.        G     D/F#     C/E     D
 Give me hope,		Give me comfort 
.        C  D                G     D     C     D
 Get me to 		a better place                    

.        G    D         C      D
 Saw you sail 	across a river  
.     G      D        C       D
 Underneath 		Orion's sword   
.        G     D/F#         C/E         D
 In your eyes 		there was a freedom     
.      C               D
 I had never 		known before

;Chorus:
[C]
.                Em    D      G
 Hey yeah yeah                
.G                       Em    D      G
 In the dark of the sun               
.          Em  D  G              C      Em      D
 We will stand      together                    
.D                     G         D        C
 Yeah we will stand as one                
.    D                   G
 Oh   in the dark of the sun

 (Solo)

.        G     D            C           D
 Past my days 		of great confusion      
.        G     D             C          D
 Past my days 		of wondering why        
.       G     D/F#      C/E            D
 Will I sail 		into the heavens        
.       C               D
 Constellations 		in my eyes

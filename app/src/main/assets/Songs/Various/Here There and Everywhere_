.F Gm7 Am7         Bb         F     Gm7
 Here, making each day of the year  
.Am7         Bb          Em7         A7
 Changing my life with a wave of her hand
.Em7    A7    Dm              Gm          Gm7   C7
 Nobody can deny that there's something there   

.F  Gm7 Am7        Bb               F     Gm7
 There, running my hand through her hair  
.Am7        Bb           Em7         A7
 Both of us thinking how good it can be
.Em7        A7           Dm          Gm        Gm7    Eb
 Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there  

;Bridge
.           Ab         Fm
 I want her everywhere 
.       Bbm             C7            Fm
 And if she's beside me I know I need never care
.Bb              C7
 But to love her is to meet her

.F    Gm7   Am7          Bb         F      Gm7
 Ev'rywhere knowing that love is to share  
.Am7        Bb           Em7        A7
 Each one believing that love never dies
.Em7          A7       Dm         Gm     Gm7    C7
 Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there  

.    Gm7     F  Gm7     Am7  Bb
 And will be there, and everywhere
.F     Gm7        Am7  Bb     F
 here, there, and everywhere</lyrics>

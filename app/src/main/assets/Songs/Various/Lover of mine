;Capo 1st fret

.A                              D
  Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
.A                                  D
  Will it ever recall what I always wanted it to?
.E                D
  Tell me I'm the lucky one,
.E                 D
 - but how you say that
.        E                  F#m                  E
 when it breaks my heart to see another one with you?

[C
.D E            F#m
 Oooh, lover of mine,
.D E            F#m
 Oooh, lover of mine.
.        D        A
 When it hurts so bad
.        E              F#m
 I wanna hold you in my arms.
.     E  D                   E
 Make me feel like you wanna be
.         A
 lover of mine.

 After we've said what there is to say
 Am I stealing your heart or am I just in your way?
 Mighty sigh for you is running wild
 Jalousy, dangerous kind,
 when I see you looking at another one that way.

;Chorus

.D                     A
 Please set me free or give me your reason
.D                  F#m
 - I try to keep it alive.
.D                    A
 There is no need for us to be lonely
.D                                           E
 - give me some kind of hope, I'm walking on fire.

;Chorus

 Make me feel like you wanna be lover of mine...
 Make me feel like you wanna be lover of mine...</lyrics>

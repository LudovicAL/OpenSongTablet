.Dm             Bb
 Ice, your only rivers run cold
.           Dm                    Bb
 These city lights, they shine in silver and gold
.             Dm                  Bb
 Dug from the night, your eyes as black as coal
.Dm        Bb        F
                     

.C                            Eb
 Walk on by, walk on through, walk till you run
.               Bb                Dm         Bb
 And don't look back, for here, I am         

.    Dm                           Bb                       Dm
 Carnival, the wheels fly and the colors spin, through alcohol
.              Bb
 Red wine that punctures the skin
.        Dm                 Bb                F
 Face to face, in a dry and waterless place   

.C                               Eb                          Bb
 Walk on by, walk on thorugh, so sad to besiege your love so head on
.F             C
 Stay tonight, stay tonight in a lie
.Eb                    Bb             F
 I'm only asking but I think you know 
.                C
 Come on take me away
.                Gm
 Come on take me away
.                A           Dm
 Come on take me home, home again

;Instrumental:
.Bb    Dm     Bb    Dm    Bb     Gm     A
                                        
.Dm-Dm-Dm!                  Bb-Bb-Bb!                Dm-Dm-Dm!                  Bb-Bb-Bb!                  F
                                                                                                           

.                           C                Eb
 And if the mountain should crumble, or disappear into the sea
.      Bb              F
 Not a tear nor not I, stay in this time
.C
 Stay tonight, in a lie
.Eb          Bb
 Ever after, there's love in time
.           F                      C
 And if you save it all, save your love
.      Gm                     A                Dm
 Don't push me too far, don't push me too far, tonight, tonight</lyrics>

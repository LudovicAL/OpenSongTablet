.Dmaj7                   D     G6                 G6/A
 Stuck inside these four walls Sent inside forever
.                Dmaj9 G
 Never seeing no one nice again
.A    G    DGm6   G    DGm6  Dm7 Gm6 Am D6 Am D6 Am
 like you,  mama, you,  mama you      

.                          D                        Am
 If I ever get out of here Thought of giving it all away
.                        D
 To a registered charity All i need is a pint of day
.     Am
 if I ever get out of here (if we ever get out of here)
.CD5 C5 D5 C5 C Fmaj7 C Fmaj7
         
.          C                    Fmaj7                            C
 Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash as we fell into the sun
.                              Fmaj7                                Em
 And the first one said to the second on there I hope you're having fun
[C]
.G           C    Em   C      Am
 Band on the run, band on the run
.        F              C               F             Fmaj7
 And the jailer man and Sailor Sam were searchin ev'ryone
.        C
 For the band on the run, band on the run
 Band on the run, band on the run
[]
.          C                 Fmaj7                             C
 Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh Seeing no one else had come
.                          Fmaj7                                 Em
 And a bell was ringing in village square For the rabbits on the run
;Chorus
.         C                        Fmaj7                        C
 Well the night was falling as the desert world Began to settle down
.                                     Fmaj7                           Em
 In the town they're searching for as ev'rywhere But we never will be found

.G           C    Em   C      Am
 Band on the run, band on the run
.        F                C                  F              Fmaj7
 And the county judge who held a grudge will search for evermore
.        C
 For the band on the run, band on the run
.                                 Em G C
 Band on the run, band on the run</lyrics>

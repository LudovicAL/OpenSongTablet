.Em
 Head like a rock spinning round and round
.   C
 I found it in a hole sitting upside down
.     A                   Am                 Em
 You point a finger at me, but i don't believe
.Em
 Paint me a wish on a velvet sky
.    C
 You demand the answers but i don't know why
.        A              Am                  Em
 In my mind...(in my mind), There is no doubt

;Chorus:
.    C                   D             Em
 The little things that make me so happy
.       C           D            Em
 All i wanna do is live by the sea
.     C                 D             Em
 The little things that make me so happy
.          A               Am                     Em
 God it's good, yes it's good, it's good to be free.

.                  GGGGGGG
 Transition chord:       

 What would you say if i said  to you
 It's not the what you say it's the what you do
 You point a finger at me but i don't believe
 Bring it on down where it was found
 Head it's like a rock sitting upside down
 Im my mind, there is no time....

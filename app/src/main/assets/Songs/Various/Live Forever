.G             D
 Baby, did you ever feel the pain
.       Am7
 In the pouring rain
.      C                D
 As it soaks you to the bone?

 (same progression with whatever the words are for the second half of the
 first verse)

.Em                      D
 And maybe I don't wanna die
.                   Am7
 Maybe I just wanna fly
.                    C
 Maybe I don't wanna leave
.                      Em
 Maybe I just don't believe
.                         D
 Maybe you're the same as me
.                            Am7
 We see things they'll never see
.                     Cadd9
 You and I gonna live forever

 etc...

;end alternating between Cadd9 and Em.</lyrics>

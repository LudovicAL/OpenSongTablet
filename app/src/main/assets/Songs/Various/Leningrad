.G            Am   C            D
   Viktor was born in spring of '44
.G              Am  C          D
   And he never saw his father anymore
.G            Am         G            A7
   A child of sacrifice,   a child of war
.G         D             Em          C      D      G
   Another son who never had a father after   Leningrad

.G            Am     C              D
   Went of to school and learned to serve the state
.G              Am    C              D
   Followed the rules  and drank his vodka straight
.G          Am          G              A7
   The only way to live  was drown the hate
.G           D             Em               C       D      G
   A Russian life was very sad and such was life in   Leningrad

.Gm                    Dm
   I was born in '49 a cold war kid in Mc Carthy time
.F                            D7
 Stop 'em a the 38th parallel blast those yellow reds to hell
.    Gm                              Dm
 And Cold War kids were hard to kill under their desk in an air raid drill
.F                                 D7
 Haven't they heard we won the war what do they keep on fighting for?

 Viktor was sent to some Red Army town
 Served out his time, became a circus clown
 The greatest happiness he'd ever found
 Was making russian children glad and children lived in Leningrad

 But children lived in Levitown and hid in the shelters underground
 Until the Soviets turned their ships around and tore all the cuban missles down
 And in that bright Oktober sun we knew our childhood days were done
 And I watched my friends go off to war what do they keep on fighting for?

 And so my child and I come to this place
 To meet him eye to eye and face to face
 He made my daughter laugh, then we embraced
 We never knew what friends we had until we came to Leningrad</lyrics>

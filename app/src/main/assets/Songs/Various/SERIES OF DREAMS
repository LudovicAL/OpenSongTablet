; NOTE: I saw one version of lyrics that had "fly" instead of "drag".  Fly
; would make it rhyme, but Dylan obviously says drag.
; FROM: The Bootleg Series 1-3, this song recorded 1989.

.       C      G               C
 I was thinkin' of a series of dreams
.       C     G                C
 Where nothing comes up to the top
.  C       G                        C
 Everything stays down where it's wounded
.                          F
 And comes to a permanent stop
.         C
 Wasn't thinking of anything specific
.                                            F
 Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams
. C
 Nothing too very scientific
.            G                  C
 Just thinkin' of a series of dreams

 Thinkin' of a series of dreams
 Where the time and the tempo drag   (fly)*
 And there's no exit in any direction
 Except the one that you can't see with your eyes
 Wasn't makin' and great connection
 Wasn't fallin' for any intricate scheme
 Nothing that would pass inspection
 I's just thinkin' of a series of dreams

;CHORUS:
. Am         F                  C
 Dreams where the umbrella is folded
.     Am  F                   C
 And into the path you are hurled
.         Am       F                     C
 And the cards are no good that you're holdin'
.                              G
 Unless they're from another world

 In one, the surface was frozen
 In another, I witnessed a crime
 In one, I was running, and in another
 All I seemed to be doing was climb
 Wasn't lookin' for any special assistance
 Not going through any great extremes
 I'd already gone the distance
 Just thinkin' of a series of dreams

;CHORUS
.C  G  C   C  F
              

.    C
 I'd already gone the distance
.             G                C    C G C
 Just thinkin' of a series of dreams
.C             G               C
 Just thinkin' of a series of dreams
.C            G                C
 Just thinkin' of a series of dreams</lyrics>

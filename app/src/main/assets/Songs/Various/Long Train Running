;Intro  Gm7     Dm7  Gm7    Repeat these chords

;Verse 1
.Gm7                   Dm7
 Down around the corner
.  Gm7                  Dm7
 a half a mile from here
.    Gm7                        Dm7
 You see them old trains runnin'
.        Gm7
 and you watch them disappear
.        Cm7   Cm6
 Without love  
.                   Gm7  Dm7 Gm7
 where would you be now      
.        Eb     Gm7  D7
 Without love        

.Gm7  Dm7Gm7
         
 You know I saw miss Lucy
 down along the tracks
 She lost her home and family
 and she won't be comin' back
 Without love
 where would you be now
 Without love

;Verse 2
.         Gm7
 Well the Illinois Central
.F#m7    Gm7
 and the Southern Central Freight
.F#m7  Gm7
 gotta keep on pushin' mama
.F#m7       Gm7
 'cause you know they're running late
 Without love
 where would you be now
 Without love

;Solo over verse 1 chords

 Well the Illinois Central
 and the Southern Central Freight
 gotta keep on pushin' mama
 'cause you know they're running late
 Without love
 where would you be now
 Without love

;Verse 2 (hold final D7 chord)
 Where the pistons keep on charmin'
 and the wheels go round' and round'
 And the steel rails are cold and hard
 for the miles they go around
 Without love
 where would you be right now
 Without love
 where would you be now?

;Vocals ad lib over intro chords

 Got to get it baby wont you move it down?
 Won't you move it down?
 Baby baby baby baby wont you move it down?
 When the big train run
 and the train is movin' on
 I got to keep on movin'
 Keep on movin'
 Keep on movin'
 Gonna keep on movin'

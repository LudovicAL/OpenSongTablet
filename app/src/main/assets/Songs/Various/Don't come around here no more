  hey  don't come around here no more   

.      C              Am
 cause I've given up  
.C                  GmAmBb
    I've given up       
.     C                Am
 yeah I've given up on waiting any longer
.C                       Gm   Am      Bb
  I've given up all this love getting stronger

 Don't come around here no more   4 times

 I don't feel you any more
 you darken my door
 whatever you're looking for
 hey don't come around here no more

 cause I've given up
 I've given up
 hey I've given up, you tangle my emotions
 I've given up, honey please, yeah but it's over

 don't come around here no more 4x

 stop walking down my street
 don't come around here no more
 who did you expect to meet
 don't come around here no more
 whatever you're looking for
 don't come around here no more</lyrics>

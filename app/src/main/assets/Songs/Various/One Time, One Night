[Intro]  D (11 measures)
 G (1 measure)
 D (4 measures)

;Verse 1

.  D     G
 A wise man was telling stories to me
.    A           G D
 about the places he had been to and the things that had seen

;Chorus

.    D     G
 A quiet voice is singing something to me
.   A         G   D
 An age old song 'bout the brave in this land here of the free,
.        G   A     D
 One time one night in America

;Verse 2
.  D
 A lady dressed in white with the man she loves
.       G
 Standing along the side of their pick up truck
.      D        G
 A shot rang out in the night
.   D    G
 Just when everything seemed right
.   D       A  D
 Another headline written down in America

;Verse 3
.    D
 The guy that lived next door in three o five
.          G
 took the kids to the park and disappeared 'bout half past nine
.   D    G    D   G
 Who will ever know how much she loved them so
.D       A  D
 That dark night alone in America

;Chorus

;Verse 4
.D
 Four small boys playing ball in the parking lot
.       G
 A preacher, a teacher, and the other became a cop
.     D      G
 A car skidded into the rain
.    D     G
 Making the last little one a saint
.D         A   D
 One more light goes out in America

;Verse 5
.  D
 A young girl tosses a coin in the wishing well
.         G
 She hopes for a heaven while for her there's just this hell
. D       G     D   G
 She gave away her life to become somebody's wife
.  D  A    D
 Another wish unanswered in America

;Bridge

.A
 People having so much faith
.        G    D
 Die too soon while all the rest come late
.   A
 We write a song that no one sings
.    G    A
 On a cold black stone where a lasting peace will finally bring

 D (7 measures)
 G (1 measure)
 D (1/2 measure)

;Verse 6
.    D
 The sunlight plays upon my window pane
.       G
 I wake up to a world that's still the same
.   D      G
 My father said to be strong
. D       G
 That a good man could never do wrong
.       D     A       D
 In a dream I had last night in America

;Verse 1
;Chorus

.D         G         A
   One time one night in America
.D   G     A
   One time one night in America

.G
 These old white lines on this highway
.C                 D
 Lord is all I know
.G
 Seems like I�ve been out here all my life
.C                         D
 But I just can�t let it go

;CHORUS:
.C
 Oh, you know I ain�t complaining
.D
 Cause I can�t tell
.G                       Em
 Lord, its just your plan
.C
 So I thank you for what I have
.D
 That�s a song
.               G
 All I have is a song

.G                                         C
 I keep thinking about the friends I�ve had
.                          D
 And all the memories we�ve shared
.G                                        C
 They keep comin� back time and time again
.                 D
 Sometimes I wonder, was it worth the cost

 And all I�ve lost

;CHORUS

.G C D
       (Play twice)

.G                                D
 So I play this song one more time
.G                        Em
 Cause lord its all I know
.C                                          D
 I�ll be standing at your door, following on
.                     G    C
 Cause all I have is a song
.                       D
 And this song will live on
.               G    C
 All I have is a song
.                       D  G
 A piece of me will live on</lyrics>

.D
 It sounds so nice
 What you're proposing
 Just once or twice
 and not disclosing
.           A7
 And not disclosing how were really really feeling
.            D
 What you're proposing

 The other night
 as I was leaving
 A-looks left and right
 and not believing
 And not believing that im finally believing
 What you're proposing

 I'll get it right
 If im composing
 But then I might
 be runny nosing
 I might be runny runny runny runny nosing
 What you're proposing

 Don't be so sure
 And just supposing
 We yell for more
 and compromising
 And compromising leads to really really feeling
 And just supposing

 Don't get me wrong
 I'm only dreaming
 It cant be long
 I must be dreaming
 I must be dreaming dreamin only only dreaming
 Am I just supposing

 It sounds so nice
 What you're proposing
 Just once or twice
 and not disclosing
 And not disclosing how were really really feeling
 What you're proposing

 The other night
 as I was leaving
 A-looks left and right
 and not believing
 And not believing that im finally believing
 What you're proposing</lyrics>

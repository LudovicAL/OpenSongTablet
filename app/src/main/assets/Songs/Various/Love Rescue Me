;INTRO uses verse chords

.A           A7
 Love rescue me
.     D                  A
 Come forth and speak to me
.         A                   E
 Raise me up and don't let me fall
.   A            A7
 No man is my enemy
.       D              A
 My own hands imprison me
.A    E      A
 Love rescue me

 Many strangers have I met
 On the road to my regret
 Many lost who seek to find themselves in me
 They ask me to reveal
 The very thoughts they would conceal
 Love rescue me

.        D                      A
 And the sun in the sky makes a shadow of you and I
.                                       E  A/E E7
 Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea 

.    A              A7
 I'm here without a name
.       D            A
 In the palace of my shame
.          E      A
 Said love rescue me

 In the cold mirror of a glass
 I see my reflection pass
 I see the dark shades of what I used to be
 I see the purple of her eyes
 The scarlet of my lies
 Love rescue me

 And the sun in the sky makes a shadow of you and I
 Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea
 I'm hanging by my thumbs
 I'm ready for whatever comes
 Love rescue me

.E                              A
 Yeah though I walk through the valley of shadow
.E                A
 Yet I will fear no evil
.       A                  A7
 I have cursed thy rod and staff
.        D              A
 They no longer comfort me

.     E      A
 Love rescue me

.     E      A
 Love rescue me

 Sha la la sha la la
 Sha la la sha la la

 I've conquered my past
 The future is here at last
 I stand at the entrance
 To a new world I can see
 The ruins to the right of me
 Will soon have lost sight of me
 Love rescue me</lyrics>

;(If that Em sounds a little too dark to you, try 022x00 (E5?))

.Em                        G
  Are you going to help me  or will you let me down?
.Em                           G
  I'm looking for a true love  but am I lost or found?
.Em                          G
  And will we cry in passion  or will we cry in pain?
.Em                             G
  And will our lonely teardrops  fill the world with rain?

.        Em   Bm                C      Am
 Help me  up,  don't you let me  down. 
.          G           C                Am          G
 I'm gonna  wake up in  heaven, not the  cold, cold  ground.

.EmG EmG
       

.Em                         G
  Can't you hear the lovers  crying in the night?
.Em                                    G
  They spend their whole lives trying;  still can't get it right.
.Em                              G
  I don't know where we're going  but I guess we'll start
.Em                                G
  And just to show that I mean it,  baby here's my heart.

;Chorus

;(Walk it up hard on the bass: G G B B C C D D)

.D             D#dim      Em              G
  Living on my  feelings,  feelings all I  know.
.C             D                C             G
  Baby once we  touch it, we'll  never let it  go.

;(I'm guessing on the D#dim -- he pulls something weird out of his hat,
;and this sounds decent.)

.G                   C      G-D-G
 Screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
.                       Bm                     C
 Like a vision dancing across the porch as the radio plays
.                             D         G                         C
 Roy Orbison singing for the lonely, hey that's me and I want you only
.                               G                     D
 Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again

 Don't run back inside, honey, you know just what I'm here for
 And you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that
 young any more
 show a little faith, there's magic in the night
 You ain't a beauty but eh, you're alright
 Oh and that's alright with me

.G         D                 G                      C
 Ohh come take my hand  We're ridin out tonight to case the Promised Land
.G     Bm           C                D
 Oh Thunder Road, Oh Thunder road, Oh Thunder Road
.G                         Bm
 Lyin' out there like a killer in the dark
.G                         C
 Hey I know it's late, we can make it if we run
.G    Bm              C           D            G
 Oh Thunder Road, sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road
.     C                         D                    G
 So I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
.       Em                                           C    D
 And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
.            C                      D
 From your front porch to my front seat
.       Bm                      Em
 Door's open but the ride ain't free
.     C                  C-           Am7                Am
 Well I know you've been waiting for words that I ain't spoken
.     D                 D+              D-             D7
 Well tonight we'll be free--all the promises will be broken

 There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
 They drive this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of
 burned-out Chevrolets
 They scream your name at night in the street
 Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
 And in the lonely cool before dawn you hear their engines roaring on
 Until you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind so Mary climb in
 It's a town full of losers and we're pulling out of here to win

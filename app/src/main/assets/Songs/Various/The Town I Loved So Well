.      G    D/F#     C/E    G
 In my memory I will always see
.    C         G               D
 The town that I have loved so well
.          G             D/F#        C/E     G
 Where our school played ball by the gasyard wall
.       C                   G     D       G
 And we laughed through the smoke and the smell
.      C           D             G       G/F# G/E  G/D
 Going home in the rain, running  up the dark lane 
.         C    C/B Am7             D
 Past the jail and down behind the fountain
.           G     D/F#       C/E        G
 Those were happy days in so many, many ways
.       C      G     D  G
 In the town I loved so well

.       G     D/F#        C/E           G
 In the early morning the shirt factory horn
.           C          G                         D
 Called the women from Creggan, the Moor and the Bog
.          G          D/F#          C/E     G
 While the men on the dole played a mothers role
.        C            G    D           G
 Fed the children and then trained the dog
.         C         D               G     G/F#  G/E   G/D
 And when times got tough there was just about enough 
.         C   C/BAm7                D
 But they saw it through without complaining
.    G      D/F#       C/E     G
 For deep inside was a burning pride
.       C      G     D  G
 In the town I loved so well

.          G     D/F#         C/E   G
 There was music there in the Derry air
.       C             G                 D
 Like a language that we all could understand
.    G          D/F#       C/E             G
 I remember the day when I earned my first pay
.      C           G     D      G
 And I played in a small pickup band
.        C        D            G        G/F#G/E   G/D
 There I spent my youth and to tell you the truth 
.      C   C/BAm7            D
 I was sad to leave it all behind me
.      G             D/F#         C/E     G
 For I learned about life and I'd found a wife
.       C      G     D  G
 In the town I loved so well

.         G   D/F#          C/E       G
 But when I returned how my eyes have burned
.   C         G                            D
 To see how a town could be brought to its knees
.       G        D/F#         C/E        G
 By the armoured cars and the bombed out bars
.        C              G     D     G
 And the gas that hangs on to every tree
.        C        D               G      G/F# G/E  G/D
 Now the army's installed by that old gasyard wall 
.        C      C/B    Am7                  D
 And the damned barbed wire gets higher and higher
.           G               D/F#        C/E                 G
 With their tanks and their guns, oh my God, what have they done
.       C      G     D  G
 To the town I loved so well

.        G       D/F#          C/E   G
 Now the music's gone but they carry on
.          C             G              D
 For their spirit's been bruised, never broken
.          G      D/F#          C/E        G
 They will not forget but their hearts are set
.     C          G     D     G
 On tomorrow and peace once again
.           C       D               G   G/F# G/E G/D
 For what's done is done and what's won is won 
.           C    C/BAm7              D
 And what's lost is lost and gone forever
.      G    D/F#       C/E               G
 I can only pray for a bright, brand new day
.       C      G     D  G
 In the town I loved so well</lyrics>

. G                                                  D
 When I get older, loosing my hair, many years from now.
.                                                                G
 Will you still be sending me a Valentine, birthday greetings, bottle of
 wine?
.                                                            C
 If I've been out till quarter to three, would you lock the door?
.                Eb7      G              E
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
. A         D7    G
 when I'm sixty-four?

.Em   Em   D   Em
               
.Em        Em     B
 You'll be older too.
.Em  Em         Am           Am
 Ah! And if you say the word 
.C       D7        G   G
 I could stay with you.

.G                                                       D
 I could be handy mending a fuse, when your lights are gone.
.                                                        G
 You can knit a sweater by the fireside. Sunday morning go for a ride.
.                                                       C
 Doing the garden, digging the weeds,who could ask for more?
.                Eb7      G              E
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
. A         D7    G
 when I'm sixty-four?

.E                                         D       E
 Every summer we can rent a cottage in the isle of Wright
.                 Em
 if it's not too dear.
.Em       Em         B   B
 We shall shrimp and save.
.Em            Am          Am
 Grandchildren on our knees
.C     D7        G   G
 Vera, Chuck and Dave.

. G                                                     D
 Send me a postcard, drop me a line, stating point of view.
.                                                           G
 Indicate precisely what you mean to say. Yours sincerely wasting away.
.                                                     C
 Give me your answer, fill in a form, - mine for ever more.
.                Eb7      G              E
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me
. A        D7     G

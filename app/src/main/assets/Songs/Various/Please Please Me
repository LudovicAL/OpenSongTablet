 Last night I said these words to my girl:

 I know you never even try girl.
.     F                   Dm                  Am                  F
 Come on, (come on), come on, (come on), come on, (come on), come on, (come on),
.         C            F         G         C
 Please please me, oh yeah, like I please you.
.                               F    C
 You don't need me to show the way, love.
.                         F     C
 Why do I always have to say, love?

 Please please me, oh yeah, like I please you.

.             F               F7                 Bb
 When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school
.Gm            C7              F    Gm
 It's a wonder I can think at all.  
.C7              F         F7           Bb
 And though my lack of education hasn't hurt me none,
.Gm             C7             F
 I can read the writing on the wall.

;Chorus:
.F7 Bb D7  G7                      Cm            F
 Kodachrome,    They give us those nice   bright colors,
.                 Bb           Eb  Cm
 They give us the greens of summers,
.                 C          F            Bb    D  G
 Makes you think all  the world's a sunny day   Oh yeah,
.         Cm      F                     Bb       Eb
 I got a Nikon camera, I love to take a photograph,
.Eb               C7     F          Bb
 So momma, don't take my Kodachrome away.

.            F               C7              Bb
 If you took all the girls I knew when I was single
.Gm                     C7             F     Gm
 And brought them all together for one night,
.C7                   F        F7        Bb
 I know they'd never match my sweet imagination,
.Gm                   C7                 F
 And ev'rything looks worse in black and white.

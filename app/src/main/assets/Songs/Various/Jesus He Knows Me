;Intro
.B         Em       D       Bm      Em
                                    
.Em                         D         Bm            Em
 Do you see the face on the TV screen coming at you every Sunday
.Em                  D          Bm          Em
 See the face on the billboard, that man is me
.Em                  D         Bm                  Em
 On the cover of the magazine, there's no question why I'm smiling
.Em                 D         Bm                 Em
 You buy a piece of paradise, you buy a piece of me

.D            E
 I'll get you everything you wanted (oohoh)
.D            E
 I'll get you everything you need (oohoh)
.D               E                           D               E
 Don't need to believe in hereafter (oohoh), just believe in me

;Chorus
.     Am       D                G   D/F#  C
 'cos Jezus He knows me, and He knows I'm right
.Am                   D     G      C
 I've been talking to Jezus all my life
.Am         D                G         C
 Oh yes, He knows me, and He knows I'm right
.Am            D          E
 And He's been telling me everything's (gonna be) allright

 I believe in the family with my ever loving wife beside me
 But she don't know about my girlfriend or the man I met last night
 Do you believe in God, 'cos that's what I'm selling
 And if you wanna go to heaven, I'll see you right

 You won't ever have to leave your house (oohoh)Or get out of your chair (oohoh)
 You don't even have to touch that dial (oohoh), 'cos I'm everywhere

;Chorus

;Bridge
.Em

.G#m           B          D#m      G#m
 Won't find me practising what I'm preaching
.G#m           B         D#m  G#m
 Won't find me making no sacrifice
.G#m       B         D#m          G#m
 But I can get you a pocketful of miracles
.G#m                  B     D#m       G#m
 If you promise to be good, try to be nice
.A                          G#m
 God will take good care of you
.     A                          BsusB
 Just do as I say, don't do as I do  

 I'm counting my blessings, I've found true happiness
 'cos I'm getting richer, day by day
 You can find me in the phone book, just call my toll free number
 You can do it anyway you want, just do it right away

 There'll be no doubt in your mind (oohoh)
 You'll believe everything I'm saying (oohoh)
 If you wanna get closer to him (oohoh)
 Get on your knees and start paying

;Chorus

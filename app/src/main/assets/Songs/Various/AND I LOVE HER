.Em         Bm
 I give her all my love
.Em           Bm
 That's all I do
.Em         Bm
 And if you saw my love
.G              A
 You'd love her too
.  D
 I love her

.Em           Bm
 She gives me everything
.Em        Bm
 And tenderly
.Em          Bm
 The kiss my lover brings
.G             A
 She brings to me
.      D
 And I love her

.Bm          D     Bm          A
 A love like ours, could never die
.Bm         A                 A+D
 As long as I have you near me

.Em             Bm
 Bright are the stars that shine
.Em          Bm
 Dark is the sky
.Em          Bm
 I know this love of mine
.G          A
 Will never die
.      D
 And I love her.

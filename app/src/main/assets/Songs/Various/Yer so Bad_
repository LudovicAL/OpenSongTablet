.Am            D      G         Am
 My sister got lucky, married a yuppie
.Am          D           G
 took him for all he was worth
.Am         D         G        Am
 now she's a swinger, dating a singer
.Am        D             G
 I can't decide which is worse

;chorus
[C
.Em      C  D  G           Em  C  D    G
 but not me baby, I've got you to save me
.G      D  C    G            D    C
 oh yer so bad, best thing I ever had
.G          D    C    G   D  C       D
 in a world gone mad, yer so bad

.Am             D       G            Am
 My sister's ex-husband can't get no lovin'
.Am           D             G
 walks around dog-faced and hurt
.Am           D        G           Am
 now he's got nothin', head in the oven
.Am         D            G
 I can't decide which is worse</lyrics>

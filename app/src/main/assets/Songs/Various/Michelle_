;Chorus
[C
.D       Gm7
 Michelle ma belle
.C                     Bdim E7     A
 These are words, that go together well,
.   E7    A
 My Michelle.

 Michelle ma belle,
 sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
 Tres bien ensemble.
[

.Dm
 I love you, I love you, I lo-ve you.
.Cm7          F7          Bb
 That's all I want to say.
.A7      Dm        Gm
 Until I find a way,
.       Dm      Dm/C#Dm/C
 I will say the only words
.Dm/B         Gm       A
 I know, that you understand.

;Chorus

 I need to, I need to, I ne-ed to
 I need to make you see,
 Oh, what you mean to me
 Until I do I'm hoping you will know, what I mean
 (I love you)

 I want you, I want you, I want you
 I think you know by now
 I'll get to you somehow
 Until I do, I'm telling you, so you'll understand.

;Chorus
 Michelle ma belle,
 sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
 Tres bien ensemble
 And I will say the only words
 I know, that you'll understand
 My Michelle.</lyrics>

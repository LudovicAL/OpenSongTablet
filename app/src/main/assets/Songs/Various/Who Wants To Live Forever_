;intro
.Am

.Am
 There's no time for us
.Em
 There's no place for us
.             C          G         A
 What is this thing that fills our dreams
.          C         D
 Yet slips away from us?

.Am
 There's no chance for us
.Em
 It's all decided for us
.               C    G         A
 This world has only one sweet moment
.     C        D
 Set aside for us.

;chorus

 Who wants to live forever?
.    C        G       Am
 Who wants to live forever
.C    D
 Oh_______ when love must die?

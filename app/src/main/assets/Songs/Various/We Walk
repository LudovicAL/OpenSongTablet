;Intro:  F  Fmaj7  Dm  Dm     F Fmaj7 Dm Dm

;On the C to Am stuff, It sounds good to walk the bass note of the C
; chord down to a B before playing Am - just like Mikey Mills

. C             Am             C                Am       C    Am  C    Am
 Up the stairs to the landing up the stairs into the hall              
. C     Am    C        Am     C  Am      Em
 Take oasis more odd spaces              
. F  Fmaj7 Dm              F  G
 We walk through the wood we walk
. C             Am             C               Am         C  Am  C  Am
 Up the stairs to the landing up the stairs into the hall           
. C     Am    C        Am     C  Am    Em
 Take oasis more odd spaces            
. F  Fmaj7 Dm               F   G
 We walk through the woods we walk

. Am    F   Bb  C  Am    F   Bb  C  Am    F    Bb C   Am    F   Bb
 Take oasis       take oasis       take oasis        take oasis 

.Bb B C             Am             C               Am           C  Am   C   Am
     Up the stairs to the landing up the stairs into the hall               
. C     Am    C        Am
 Take oasis more odd spaces

 We walk through the world we walk
 Up the stairs to the landing up the stairs into the hall
 Take oasis more odd spaces
 Up the stairs to the landing up the stairs into the hall
 Take oasis more odd spaces
 Up the stairs to the landing up the stairs into the hall
 Into the hall</lyrics>

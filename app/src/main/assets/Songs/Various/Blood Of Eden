;intro
.Bb Eb
    

.Bb                      Eb
  I caught sight of my reflection
.                   Bb
 I caught it in the window
.                         Eb
 I saw the darkness in my heart
.Bb
 I saw the signs of my undoing
.Eb
 They had been there from the start
.Bb
 And the darkness still has work to do
.Eb
 The knotted chord's untying
.    Bb
 The heated and the holy
.           Eb
 Oh they're sitting there on high
.     Bb                           Eb
 So secure with everything they're buying

;chorus
[C]
.                Ab   Eb          Bb            Cm
 In the blood of Eden     lie the woman and the man
.         Ab         Eb            Bb           Cm
 With the man in the woman and the woman in the man
.                Ab   Eb          Bb            Cm
 In the blood of Eden     lie the woman and the man
.                  Ab    Eb Bb     Ab/Bb        Bb
 We wanted the the union    oh the union of the woman,
[]
.    Fm/Bb         Eb
 the woman and the man

.Bb Eb
 
 My grip is surely slipping
 I think I've lost my hold
 Yes I think I've lost my hold
 I cannot get insurance any more
 They don't take credit, only gold
 Is that a dagger or a crucifix I see
 You hold so tightly in your hand
 And all the while the distance grows between you and me
 I do not understand

;chorus
.    Fm/Bb         Cm
 the woman and the man

;bridge
.Cm Cm/AbBb    Bb/G Cm/Ab
 At my request  you take me in
.Cm      Cm/Ab Bb  Bb/G  Cm/Ab     Cm
 In that tenderness I am floating away
.   Cm/Ab  Bb Bb/G        Cm/Ab
 No certainty, nothing to rely on
.Cm Cm/Ab Bb    Bb/G   Cm/Ab
  Holding still  for a moment
.       F
 What a moment this is
.         Cm/Ab
 Oh for a moment of forgetting
.  F
 A moment of bliss
.Eb     Bb, Eb
 Oh....  

 I can hear the distant thunder
 Of a million unheard souls
 Of a million unheard souls
 Watch each one reach for creature comfort
 For the filling of their holes

;chorus (without last line)
.           Ab         Eb            Bb           Cm
 I feel the man in the woman and the woman in the man
 In the blood of Eden we have done everything we can
 In the blood of Eden, so we end as we began
 With the man in the woman and the woman in the man
.                   Ab    Eb Bb     Ab/Bb        Bb         Fm/Bb         Cm
 It was all for the union,   oh the union of the woman, the woman and the man</lyrics>

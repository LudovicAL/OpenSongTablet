 When I think of heaven   (Deliver me in a black-winged bird)  
.G          Am      G             C               G
 I think of flying    down into a sea of pens and feathers and

 All other other instruments of faith and sex and God in the belly of a black winged bird.

 Don't try to feed me.   'Cause I've been here before and I deserve a little more.

 I belong in the service of the Queen.  I belong   anywhere but in between.

 She's been crying.   I've been thinking.  And I am the Rain King.

 I said Mama, Mama, Mama, why am I so alone?
 I can't go outside.  I'm scared I might not make it home.
 Well, I'm alive, I'm alive, but I'm sinking in.
 If there's anyone at home at your place, darlin', why don't you invite me in?
 Don't try to bleed me.  'Cause I've been there before and I deserve a little more.

   Hey, I only want the same as anyone.  Henderson is waiting for the sun.

 Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends.  After all the dreaming I come home again.

 When I think of heaven (Deliver me in a black-winged bird)
 I think of dying.  Lay me down in a field of flame and heather.
 Render up my body into the burning heart of God in the belly of a black-winged bird.

 Well I said that I am the Rain King.  Well I said, I, I, I, I, I, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 Well I am the Rain King.  Yeeeeaaaah!

.Am      G       Dm      Am
 ------- ------- ------- ---------

.G                                                   Em
 Do you remember a guy that's been In such an early song
.C                                                         D
 I've heard a rumor from ground control Oh no don't say it's true
.F                                                   C             G/B
 They got a message from the action man I'm happy hope you're happy too
.F                                    G    E/G#
 I've loved all I've needed love Sordid details following
.A                                                     E
 The shrieking of nothing is killing me Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
.G                                                             D    C          E
 And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair But the planet is glowing    
.F                      G                       C                        A
 Ashes to Ashes funk to funky We know major Tom's a junky                
.F                                G         Am                      G    Dm
 Strung our in heaven's high Hitting an all time low                     
.A

.G                                   Em
 Time and again I tell myself   I'll stay clean tonight
.C                                                         D
 But the little green wheels are following me Oh no not again
.F                                        C              G/B
 I'm stuck with a valuable friend  I'm happy hope you're happy too

.                           G                     E/G# A
 One flash of light but no smoking pistol I've never done good things
.E                                G
 I've never done bad things I've never done anything out of the blue
.F                                     C
 I want an axe to break the ice  I want to come down right now
.F                      G                  C                        Am
 Ashes to Ashes funk to funky We know major Tom's a junky           
.F                                G     Am
 Strung our in heaven's high  Hitting an all time low
.Am  G  Dm  Am
 My mama said to get things done You'd better not mess with major Tom</lyrics>

 When you get up in the morning and the light is hurt'n your head
.     Gm                            Gm
 The first--- thing you do when you get up out of bed
.   Gm                            Gm
 Is hit that street a-runnin' and try to meet the masses
.   Gm
 And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses

 da-da ta    da-da ta     ta-dud dit dah  (x3)   ( a la Beavis and
 Butt-head )
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

 I spot a little thing and I followed her all night
 In a funky pair of levis and her sweater's kind of tight
 She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molases
 But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses

 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

 Now go out and get yourself some big black frames
 With the glass so dark thay won't even know your name
 And the choice is up to you cause they come in two classes
 Rhinestone shades and cheap sunglasses
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah</lyrics>

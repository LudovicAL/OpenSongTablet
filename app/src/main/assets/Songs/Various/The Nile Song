[Intro] A  G  A  G  A  G  F#

.B                         A
    I was standing by the Nile
.B                       A
    Whe I saw the lady smile.
.B                               A     G#
    I would take her out for a while, for a while.

.C#                           B
    Light tears wept like a child.
.C#                                  B
    How her golden hair was blowing wild.
.C#                                B   A#
    Then she spread her wings to fly, for to fly.

.D#                          C#
    Soaring high above the breezes,
.D#                          C#
    Going always where she pleases.
.D#                          C#    C
    She will make it to the island in the sun.

.F                         D#
    I will follow in her shadow
.F                          D#
    As I watch her from my window.
.F                          D#   D
    One day I will catch her eye.

 Solo:  G  F  G  F  G  F  E
 A  G  A  G  A  G  F#

.B                           A
    She is calling from the deep,
.B                                 A
    Summoning my soul to endless sleep.
.B                           A      G#
    She is bound to drag me down, drag me down.

 Final solo: C# B  C# B  C# B  A#
 D# C# D# C# D# ... (fade out)

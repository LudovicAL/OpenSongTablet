 Note:  This was transcribed from the MTV "plugged" version so it may be
 different from the recorded version.  I've done the intro and the

[V1]  (Keyboard part played over the top)

.Bb                                            F
 Sitting here wasted and wounded with this old piano.

.       Bb                                         F
 Trying hard to capture the moment, this morning I don't know.

.         Am                    Bb                       F
 'cause a bottle of vodka still lies in my head and some blonde

.                                                   Bb
 gave me nightmares, I think that she's still in my bed.

.     Bb                      C                         F
 As I think about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead.

.        Bb                                          F
 With an iron-clad fist I wake up to french-kiss the morning.

.        Bb                                                        F
 While a marching band keeps it's own beat in my head while we're talking

.      Am                  Bb                       F
 about all of the things I longed to believe, about love, the truth,

.                            Bb
 what you mean to me and the truth is...

 Bb          C          (rhythm fig #1)
 Baby you're all that I need.

[C]

 Dm      C         Bb     F   (rhythm fig #3)
 I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses.

 Dm        C          Bb     F    (rhythm fig #2)
 Tonight I sleep on a bed of nails.

.        Bb         F            Bb   F
 I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is.

.Dm  C   Bb                F
 Lay you down, on a bed of roses.

 Verse #2:

 I'm so far away, each step that I take's on my way home.
 A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night to see through this payphone.
 But I'd run out of time or it's hard to get through till the bird on the wire
 flies me back to you. I'll just close my eyes.
 And whisper "baby it probably is true".

[B]

.    Bb                  C
 The hotel bars hangover whiskey's gone dry.

.       F
 The bartender's wig's crooked, she's giving me the eye.

 Bb                       Bb              C         F  (rhythm fig. #1)
 I might've said yes, but I laughed so hard I think I died.

 Solo:
.----

 |&amp;lt;- I made this up because it's |
 |   bloody hard to transcribe   |
 |   from videotape !          -&amp;gt;|

[V3]

 Now as you close your eyes you know I'll be thinking about you.
 My mistress she calls me to stand in her spotlight again.
 I won't be alone, you know that don't mean I'm not lonely.
 I've got nothing to prove, for its you I'd die to defend.</lyrics>

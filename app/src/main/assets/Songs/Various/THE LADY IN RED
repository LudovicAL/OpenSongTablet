[Intro] D  G7+  A4  D  G7+   A4

.      D                      G7+                    A
 I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
.      F#7        F#7/A#       Bm    A7   G
 I've never seen you shine so bright   Mmmm
.      D                   G7+                         A
 I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
.          F#7       F#7/A#     Bm
 They're looking for a little romance
.       D7     G
 Given half a chance
.          Em7
 And I've never seen that dress you're wearing
.         A7
 Or that highlights in your hair
.                  Bm
 That catch your eyes
.             A
 I have been blind

;CHORUS
.     A7/G      D       D/F#     G
 The lady in red                 
.  A         Bm     A/C#
 is dancing with me 
 Cheek to cheek
.                 Em7  A
 There's nobody here   
.                   D
 It's just you and me
.               D7
 It's where I wanna be
.               G   F#7/A#
 But I hardly know  
.      F#7          Bm    Bm/A    E7
 this beauty by my side           
.             Em7   A9
 I'll never forget  
.              A    D
 the way you look tonight

 I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
 I've never seen you shine so bright you were amazing
 I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
 And when you turned to me and smiled it took my breath away
 And I have never had such a feeling such a feeling
 Of complete and utter love, as I do tonight

;CHORUS
.     A             Bm     Bm/A   E7
 The way you look tonight         
.              Em7        A9       A     D
 I never will forget the way you look tonight
.G7+9       A4     D

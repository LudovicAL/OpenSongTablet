.C
 A winter's day-
.     F               C
 in a deep and dark December
.Dm G7  F   C
 I am alone-
.Dm7            Em7    Dm7              Em7
 Gazing from my window to the streets below
.     Dm             F                G
 On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.

.F      C      F       G    C Am
 I am a rock,  I am an island.

 I've built walls,
 A fortress deep and mity
 That none may penetrate
 I have no need of friendship
 friendship causes pain
 It's laughter and loving I disdain

 I am a rock, I am an island

 Don't talk of love
 but I've heard the word before
 It's sleeping in my memory
 I won't disturb the slumber of the feelings that have died
 If I never loved I never would have cried

 I am a rock, I am an island

 I have my books
 and my poetry to protect me
 I am shielded in my armour
 Hiding in my room, safe within my womb,
 I touch no one and no one touches me.

.F      C     F       G    C
 I am a rock, I am an island
.      Dm7  G        C            Dm7    G     C
 And a rock feels no pain, and an island never cries.</lyrics>

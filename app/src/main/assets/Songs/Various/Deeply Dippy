.G                      Em
 Deeply dippy 'bout the curves you got
.F          C
 deeply hot hot for the curves you got
.G                      Em
 Deeply dippy 'bout the fun we had
.F          C
 deeply mad mad for the fun we had
.G     Em
 Oh my love
.  F                   C
 I can't make head nor tail of passion
.G     Em
 Oh my love
.F                      C
 let's set sail for the seas of passion now

.Bb   A    Ab   G
                
 Deeply dippy 'bout the way you walk
 contact sport let the neighbours talk
 Deeply dippy I'm your superman
 I'll explain you're my Lois Lane
 Oh my love
 I can't make head nor tail of passion
 Oh my love
 let's set sail for the seas of passion now

 Deeply dippy 'bout your spanish eyes
 sierra smile legs that go on for miles
 and miles
 Miles and miles

 I said oh my love
 I can't make head nor tail of passion
 Oh my love
 let's set sail for the seas of passion now</lyrics>

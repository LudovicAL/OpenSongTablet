.C                     F               C      C
  People say I'm crazy  doing what I'm  doing 
.          C                              F                C     C
 Well they  give me all kinds of warnings  to save me from  ruin 
.F                                   G
  When I say that I'm o.k. well they  look at me kind of strange
.F                                   Dm               G
  Surely you're not happy now you no  longer play the  game

.C                    F            C          C
  People say I'm lazy  dreaming my  life away 
.          C                            F              C          C
 Well they  give me all kinds of advice  designed to enlighten me 
.       F                                       G
 When I  tell them that I'm doing fine watching  shadows on the wall
.F                                          Dm             G
  Don't you miss the big time boy you're no  longer on the  ball

.F         G                          C                    Am
  I'm just  sitting here watching the  wheels go round and  round
.F         Am/E                Am     Dm Dm7/C
  I really  love to watch them  roll     
.G                        Am              Am/G
  No longer riding on the  merry-go-round 
.F       Ab6
  I just had to let it go

.C F C F
       

.C                        F           C      C
  People asking questions  lost in confusion 
.       C                              F       C       C
 Well I  tell them there's no problem,  only solutions 
.          F                           Dm            G
 Well they  shake their heads and they look at me as  if I've lost my mind
.  F                     Dm                   G
 I  tell them there's no hurry . . . I'm just  sitting here doing time

;Chorus

.F      Ab6           C    F#dim7
 I just had to let it go   
.F      Ab6              C7
 I just had to let it go</lyrics>

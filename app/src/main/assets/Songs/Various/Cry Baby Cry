.G        Am  F                  G
 Cry baby cry make your mother sigh
.      Em7                A7     F
 she's old enough to know better 

.    Em      Em+7                   Em7          Em6                 C7  G
 The king of Marigold was in the kitchen cooking breakfast for the queen.
.    Em               Em+7              Em7             Em6           C7
 The queen was in the parlour playing piano for the children of the king.

.G        Am  F                  G
 Cry baby cry make your mother sigh
.      Em7                   A7       F        G
 she's old enough to know better so cry baby cry.

 The king was in the garden picking flowers for a friend who came to play.
 The queen was in the playroom painting pictures for the childrens holiday.

;chorus

 The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling and arriving late for tea.
 The duke was having problems with a message at the local bird and bee.

;chorus

 At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table for a seance in the dark.
 With voices out of nowhere put on specially by the children for a lark.

;chorus

.G       Am       F
 Cry cry cry baby make ...
.G       Am       F                  G
 Cry cry cry baby make your mother sigh
.      Em7                   A7     F        Em
 she's old enough to know better so cry baby cry.</lyrics>

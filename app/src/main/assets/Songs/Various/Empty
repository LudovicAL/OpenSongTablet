;Intro :
 2 x  Piano :  A  E  B  |  G#  D#  B  | A  C#  B |  A  C#  B

 with Piano &amp; Violin, the guitar plays these broken chords
 2 x        :      Esus4  |  G#m   |   A   |  A   |

 then the guitar plays these Chords normally
 2 x        :      Esus4  | G#m/B  |  A   |   A   |

;Couplet :
.Esus4          G#m/B
  Something has  left my life
.      A                    A
 and i  don't know where it  went to (oh oh ooh)

.Esus4     G#m/B
  Somebody caused me strife
.         A               A
 and it's  not what i was  seeking

.           Esus4               G#m/B
 Didn't you  see me, didn't you  hear me
.           A                A             Esus4
 Didn't you  see me standing  there (oh oh  ooh)

.                 G#m/B
 Why did you turn  of the lights
.        A                A
 Did you  know that i was  sleeping?

;Break :
.Am     C              G
  Say a  prayer for me  (eeeh)
.           Em
 Help me to  feel the strenght i did

.Am  C                     G
  my  identity has it been  taken
.            Em              Am            C
 is my heart  breaking on me  (eeh) all my  plans
.                G                           Em
 fell through my  hands, they fell trough my  hands

.        Am            C
 Only he  (eeh) all my  dreams
.            G                   Em
 it suddenly  seems, it suddenly  seems

;Chorus :
.      Am       C        G        Em
 Empty  hie hie  hie hie  hie hie 
.      Am       C        G        Em
 Empty  hie hie  hie hie  hie hie 

 then it's just the couplet with the violin solo

.                       Am

.             C                          E7
 Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
.                 F                    G                  Am
 You pull on your finger, then another finger, then the cigarette
.G                   F          G                         Am
 The wall to wall is calling it lingers, but still you forget
.G         F                             C
 Oh oh oh, you're a rock 'n roll suicide 

.G                 C                            E7
 You're too old to lose it, you're too young to choose it
.        F              G                 Am
 And the clock waits so patiently on your song
.G               F                   G                         Am
 You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
.G             F                              C
 Oh, no no no, you're a rock 'n roll suicide  

.G               C                        E7
 Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
.        F            G                  Am
 But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
.G             F                 G                  E7                    Am
 Don't let the sun blast your shadow, don't let the milk float blind your mind
.   F         D9              G7
 So natural religiously unkind

.                       C                                         A
 Oh no love you're not alone, you're watching yourself but you're too unfair
.             C                                        A
 You got your head all tangled but but if I could only make you care
.   C#m                 G#m            B                  D#m
 Oh no love you're not alone no matter what or who you've been
.          Bbm                  Db           B                         D#m
 No matter when or where you've seen all the knives that lacerate your brain
.            Bbm                               Db                      Bb
 I've had my share, now I'll help you with the pain, you're not alone  

.Db                     Bb         Db
 Just turn on me you're not alone, let's turn on me and be
.Bb                Db               Bb                Db
 You're not alone, gimme your hands you're wonderful, gimme your hands
.Bb                Db               Bb                Db
 You're not alone, gimme your hands you're wonderful, gimme your hands
.Bb        Fm        Cm        Gb        Db</lyrics>

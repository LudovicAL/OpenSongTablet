.Fm                     C7
 I see a red door and I want it painted black
.Fm                   C7
 No colors any more I want them to turn black
.Fm  Eb      Ab                    Fm
 I   see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
.Fm  Eb      Ab      Eb     Bb               C7
 I   have to turn my head until the darkness goes

.Fm                       C7
 I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
.Fm                            C7
 With flowers and my love both never to come back
.Fm  Eb         Ab                   Fm
 I   see people turn their heads and quickly look away
.Fm     Eb       Ab   E6      Bb            C7
 Like a new born baby it just happens every day

.Fm                       C7
 I look inside myself and see my heart is black
.Fm                      C7
 I see my red door and I want it painted black
.Fm    Eb        Ab            Fm
 Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the fact
.Fm       Eb   Ab     Eb      Bb                  C7
 It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

.Fm                           C7
 No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
.Fm                            C7
 I could not forsee this thing happening to you
.Fm   Eb     Ab   Eb     Fm
 If   I look hard enough into the setting sun
.Fm  Eb        Ab         Eb   Bb               C7
 My  love will laugh with me before the morning comes

;Repeat first verse

.C7                 Fm                   C7
 I want to see your face, painted black, black as night
.      Fm                       C7
 Don't wanna see the sun flying high in the sky
.               Fm                                 C7    Fm
 I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black Yeah</lyrics>

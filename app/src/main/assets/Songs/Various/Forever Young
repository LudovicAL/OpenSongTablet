;I think this is actually in A-flat, capo up one fret.

.   G
 1. May God bless and keep you always
 2. May you grow up to be righteous
 3. May you hands always be busy

.            C               G
 1. May your wishes all come true
 2. May you  grow up to be   true
 3. May your feet always be  swift

.   G
 1. May you always do for others
 2. May you always know the truth
 3. May you have a strong foundation

.            D
 1. And let  others do for you
 2. And see  the light surrounding you
 3. When the winds of changes shift

.   D        G
 1. May you  build a ladder to the stars
 2. May you  always be courageous
 3. May your heart always be joyful

.            C              G
 1. And      climb on every rung
 2. Stand    upright and be strong
 3. May your song always be sung

.       G           G    D         G    C
 1,2,3. And may you stay   forever young

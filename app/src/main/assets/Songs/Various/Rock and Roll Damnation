;verse:
 y' say that that you play too loud
 well baby that's tough
 y'say that you got too much
 can't get enough
 tell you that you look a fool
 baby I'm a fool for you
 say that you're my disease
 well, shake your stuff

[C]
;chorus:
.        G5      D/F#     A5
 It's a Rock and Roll damnation
.G5       D/F#      A5
 ma's own whipping boy
.G5       D/F#     A5
 rock and roll damnation
.D5
 take a chance
.E5
 while you still got a choice
[]

;verse2:
 you say that you want respect
 honey grow up
 everything that you've done for me
 well thanks a lot
 c'mon, get up off your bended knees
 y'can , set your mind at ease
 my temperature's running hot
 and I've been waiting all night for a bite of what
 you've got,and

;Chorus: (Intro section over the lyrics)
[C]
 just a boy with a toy  ( ??? )
 come on and take your choice
 cos you're way out of reach
 living in your sin you gotta practise what you preach
[]
;Chorus:
[C]
.        G5      D/F#     A5
 It's a Rock and Roll damnation
.G5       D/F#      A5
 ma's own whipping boy
.G5       D/F#     A5
 rock and roll damnation
.D5
 take a chance
.D5
 while you still got a choice

.                            A
 I went to work for her that summer
.                          F#m
 A teenage kid so far from home
.                       D
 She was a lonely widow woman
.                            E      Esus4
 Hell bent to make it on her own    

.                               A      Asus2
 We were a thousands miles from nowhere
.                               F#m
 Wheat fields as far as I could see
.                                D     Dsus2   E
 Both needing something from eachother         
.                                A
 Not knowing yet what that might be

 Till she came to me one evening
 Hot cup of coffee and a smile
 In a dress that I was certain
 She hadn't worn in quite a while

 There was a difference in her laughter
 There was a softness in her eyes
 And on the air there was a hunger
 Even a boy could recognize

.                           E          D
 She had a need to feel the thunder    
.                                A     Asus2    A
 To chase the lightning from the sky            
.                                D      Dsus2    D
 To watch the storm and all it's wonders         
.                     E    Esus4   E
 Raging in her lovers eyes         
.                            F#m     E    D
 She had to ride the heat of passion      
.                     A     Asus2   A
 Like a comet burning bright        
.                        D
 Rushing headlong in the wind
.               Dsus2       E
 Out where only dreams have been
.                         A
 Burning both ends of the night

 That summer wind was all around me
 Nothing between us but the night
 And when I told her that I'd never
 She softly whispered that's alright

 And then I watched her hands of leather
 Turn to velvet in a touch
 There's never been another summer
 When I have ever learned so much

 We had a need to feel the thunder
 To chase the lightning from the sky
 To watch the storm and all it's wonders
 Raging in eachothers eyes
 We had to ride the heat of passion
 Like a comet burning bright
 Rushing headlong in the wind
 Out where only dreams have been
 Burning both ends of the night

.A    Asus2    A
               

 I often think about that summer
 The sweat the moonlight and the lace
 And I have rarely held another
 When I haven't seen her face

 And everytime I pass a wheat field
 And watch it dancing in the wind
 Although I know it isn't real
 I just can't help but feel
 Her hungry arms again

 She had a need to feel the thunder...

 Rushing headlong in the wind
 Out where only dreams have been
 Burning both ends of the night

.A     D     E     D  C#m  Bm</lyrics>

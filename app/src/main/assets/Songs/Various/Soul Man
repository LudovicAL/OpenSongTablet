;Intro
.G      F      Bb    C      D

.                GAmG                       G Am G
 Comin' to you              on a dusty road      
 Good good lovin, I got a truckload
 And when you get it you got somethin'
 So don't worry 'cause I'm comin'

;Chorus
[C
.       G        F              G
 I'm a soul man          I'm a soul man
.       G        F              G
 I'm a soul man          I'm a soul man
.C               D
 And that ain't all
[

 Got what I got the hard way
 And I'll make it better each and every day
 I was educated from good stock
 When I start lovin', oh, I can't stop

;Chorus

 I was brought up on a side street
 I learned how to love before I could eat
 So don't worry and don't you fret
 'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet

;Chorus

 Grab a rope and I'll pull you in

 Give you hope and be your only boyfriend, yeah, yeah, yeah

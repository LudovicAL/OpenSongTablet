.G                                                 C
 In the day we  sweat it out  on the streets  of a runaway
.         D
 American dream
.   G                                               C       D7
 At night  we ride  through  mansions of  glory  in suicide machines
.C                    G
 Sprung from cages on highway 9
.       Am                        D                     C
 Chrome wheels, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
.C                        G
 Baby, this town rips the bones from your back
.       Am                 D
 It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
.        C                       Am
 I wanna get out while I'm still young
.       C               D                    G
 'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

.G
 Well, Wendy, let  me in, I  wanna be your  friend, I wanna
.C                     D
 guard your dreams and visions
.     G
 Just wrap your legs  'round these velvet  rims, strap your
.C               D
 hands across my engines
.      C               G
 And together we could break this trap
.      Am                   D                   C
 We'll run til we drop, and baby we'll never go back
.C                G
 Walk with me out on the wire
.Am                          D
 Girl, I'm just a scared and lonely rider
.      C                 Am
 And I gotta know how it feels
.        C                       D                     G
 I wanna know if love is wild, I wanna know if love is real

.D                                         F
 Beyond the  Palace  hemi-powered  drones  scream  down the
 boulevard
.          C
 The girls comb their hair in the rear view mirrors and the
.Am                  G
 boys try to look so hard
.     D                                            F
 The amusement park rises bold and stark, kids are huddled on
 the beach in the mist
.              C
 Well, I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight in
.   Am          D
 an everlasting kiss

.          G                                           C
 Well, the highway's  jammed with  broken heroes  on a last
.             D
 chance power drive
.     G                                              C
 Everybody's out on the run tonight, but there ain't no place
.        D
 left to hide
.  C               G
 Together we could live with the sadness
.     Am                    D              C
 I'll love you with all the maddness in my soul
.                 G
 Someday, baby, I don't know when
.            Am                        D            C
 We're gonna get to that place that we really wanna go
.C                     Am
 And we'll walk in the sun
.          C               D                    G
 Til then, tramps like us, baby we were born to run</lyrics>

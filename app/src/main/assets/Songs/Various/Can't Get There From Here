.Bm7  Bm  C#m        B
 When the world is a monster
.Bm7 Bm   C#m        B
 Bad to swallow you whole
.E                              B     G#
 Kick the clay that holds those teeth in  (G# with open B and E strings)
.G6                          F#
 Throw your troubles out the door (F# with open B and E strings)

.Bm7 Bm   C#m         B
 If you're needing inspiration
.Bm7   C#m             BB7
 Philomath is where I go
.E                        B   G#
 Lawyer Jeff he knows the lowdown
.G6                        F#
 He's mighty glad to visit home

.E         A        F#      B
 I've been there I know the way
 Can't get there from here
.       F#
.......

 When your hands are feeling empty
 Stick heads jumpin off the ground, 'round
 Tris is sure to shirr the deers out
 Run away sing my song

.B           D                  A   B
 Hands down Calechee bound          
.B           D                  A   B
 Landlocked kiss the ground         
 Dirt of seven continents going round and round
 Go on ahead Mr. Citywide hypnotized, suit and tied
 Gentlemen, testify
.     F#
.....

 If your world is a monster
 Bad to swallow you whole
 Philomath they know the lowdown
 Throw your troubles out the door

.          E EE7 E7 E7

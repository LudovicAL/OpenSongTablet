;Men At Work

.Bm              A               Bm   G  A
 Travelling in a friedout combie         
.Bm          A                  Bm     G  A
 on a hippie trail head full of zombie    
.Bm              A    Bm          G      A
 I met a strange lady she made me nervous
.Bm          A              Bm        G       A
 She took me in and gave me breakfast and she said:
;Chorus
.D                   A               Bm   G  A
 "Do you come from a land down under?        
.D           A                Bm  G  A
 Where women glow and men plunder    
.D                        A               Bm   G  A
 can't you hear can't you hear the thunder        
.    D              A                 Bm   G  A
 you better run you better take cover"        

.Bm                       A               Bm   G  A
 Buying bread from from a man in Bruselles        
.       Bm            A           Bm      G  A
 He was six-foot-four and full of muscles    
.Bm              A                  Bm   G  A
 I said: "Do you speak my language?"        
.Bm                 A                  Bm        G     A
 He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich. He said:
;Chorus
.D              A              Bm   G  A
 "I come from a land down under        
.D               A                Bm  G  A
 Where beer does flow and men chunder    
.D                        A               Bm   G  A
 can't you hear can't you hear the thunder        
.    D              A                 Bm   G  A
 you better run you better take cover"        

.Bm         A            Bm   G  A
 Lying in a den in Bombay        
.Bm           A                Bm    G  A
 With a slack jaw and not much to say   
.Bm            A                       Bm       G  A
 I said to the man: "Are you trying to tempt me?   
.Bm             A                Bm            G  A
 Because I come from the land of plenty?"  and he said:
;Chorus
.D                       A              Bm   G  A
 "Oh! do you come from a land down under        
.D           A                Bm  G  A
 Where women glow and men plunder    
.D                        A               Bm   G  A
 can't you hear can't you hear the thunder        
.    D              A                 Bm   G  A
 you better run you better take cover"</lyrics>

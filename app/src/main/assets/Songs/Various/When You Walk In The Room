;intro riff
.       A
 I can feel a new expression on my face
.                                       E
 I can feel a glowing sensation taking place
.       D                E              A    F#m
 I can hear the guitars playing lovely tunes 
. D    C#m        E               A
 Every time that you walk in the room

;repeat intro riff 2x

 I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
 Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
 I see a summer's night with a magic moon
 Every time that you walk in the room

;repeat intro riff 1x

.D     C#m     E
 Maybe it's a dream come true
.D        C#m        E
 Walking right alongside of you
.A                         F#m
 Wish I could tell you how much I care
.B7                            E
 But I only have the nerve to stare

 I can feel-a something pounding in my brain
 Just anytime that someone speaks your name
 Trumpets sound and I hear thunder boom
 Every time that you walk in the room

;outro repeat intro riff 1x, than:

.D     C#m        E               A
 Every time that you walk in the room

;intro riff 2x - second time unaccompanied; end on A</lyrics>

;Chorus:
.                   B
 If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
.                                       F#
 Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me

 If you need me let me know, gonna be around
.                                      B
 If you got no place to go when you're feelin' down
.               B
 If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown
.                                       F#
 Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me

 Gonna do my very best, and it ain't no lie
.                                  B
 If you put me to the test, if you let me try
.       C#m          F#
 Take a chance on me 
;(that's all I ask of you, honey) - 1st time
;(c'mon, give me a break, man)    - 2nd time
.       C#m          F#
 Take a chance on me 

.C#m
 We can go dancing, we can go walking
.   B
 As long as we're together
.C#m
 Listen to some music, maybe just talking
.B
 Get to know me better
.                         G#m
 Cause you know I've got, so much that I wanna do
.E                                     G#m  G#m E F#
 When I dream I'm alone with you, it's magic
.G#m                          E
 You want to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
.            C#m      F#      C#m         F#
 But I think you know, that I can't let go

;Chorus

.           C#m
 Oh you can take your chance baby, I'm in no hurry
.B
 Ooh I'm gonna get you
.C#m
 You're the one that hurt me, baby don't worry
.B
 I ain't gonna let you
.G#m
 My love is strong enough
.E                                   G#m  E F#
 To last when things are rough, it's magic
.G#m                            E
 You say that I waste my time, but I can't get you off my mind
.     C#m         F#        C#m        F#
 Oh I can't let go, cause I love you so

;Chorus

.C       E     F
 Stuck on you, I've got this feeling down deep in my soul
.G                      C                      E      F      G
 That I just can't lose,Guess I'm on my way..................
 Needed a friend, And the way I feel now
 A guess I'll be with you till the end, Guess I'm on my way
 Mighty glad you stayed

 Stuck on you, Been a fool too long
 I guess it's time for me to come home, Guess I'm on my way
 So hard to see, That a woman like you
 Could wait around for a man like me, Guess I'm on my way
 Mighty glad you stayed

.E  F                       G                      C
...Oh! I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
.E  F          G         C
...And I know just where I'm going
.E  F            G                    C
...Packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
.E  F                   E  F
..........................
.F
 'Cause this time , little darling
.                   G
 I'm coming home to stay

 I'm stuck on you, I've got this feeling down deep in my soul
 That I just can't lose, Guess I'm on my way
 Needed a friend, And the way I feel now
 A guess I'll be with you till the end, Guess I'm on my way
 Mighty glad you stayed</lyrics>

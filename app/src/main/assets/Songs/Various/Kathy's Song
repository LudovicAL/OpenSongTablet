.G          C              G     Am     Em  C     Bm7
 I hear the drizzle of the rain_ Like a memory it falls
.G        Bm      G   C    Am      Em    D        G     C   G
 Soft and warm continuing_ Tapping on my roof and walls     

.G            C             G     Am          Em     C     Bm7
 And from the shelter of my mind_ Through the window of my eyes
.G        Bm       G             C        Am         Em       D     G    C   G
 I gaze beyond the rain drenched streets_ To England where my heart lies     

.G            C           G         Am Em                C      Bm7
 My mind's distracted and diffused_ My thoughts are many miles away
.G             Bm       G       C      Am           Em       D          G   C   G
 They lie with you when you're asleep_ And kiss you when you start your day     

.G                C               G       Am           Em    C         Bm7
 And a song I was writing is left undone_ I don't know why I spent the time
.G       Bm     G       C      Am              Em       D         G     C    G
 Writing song I can't believe_ With words that tear and strain to rhyme      

.G          C                  G      Am       Em     C       Bm7
 And so you see I have come to doubt_ All that I once held as true
.G        Bm       G     C      Am       Em      D       G   C   G
 I stand alone without beliefs_ The only truth I know is you     

.G        C                  G    Am          Em    C         Bm7
 And as I watch the drops of rain weave their weary paths and die
.G           Bm   G        C     Am                Em       D      G  C    G
 I know that I am like the rain_ There but for the grace of you go I.</lyrics>

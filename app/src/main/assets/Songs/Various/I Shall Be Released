.E                            F#m     G#m        F#m      B      E
 They say everything can be replaced, that every distance is not near
.E                   F#m   G#m      F#m       B      E
 So I remember every face, of every man who's put me here

;Chorus:
.  E                 F#m      G#m      F#m    B      E
 I see my light come shining, from the west unto the east
.E            F#m          G#m F#m B    E
 Any day now, any way now, I shall be reelased

.E                           F#m      G#m        F#m      B        E
 They say every man needs protection, that every man must rise and fall
.E                      F#m       G#m          F#m   B         E
 Yet I swear I see my reflection, somewhere so high above this wall

;Chorus:

.E                           F#m           G#m       F#m         B      E
 Yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd, a man who swears he's not to blame
.E                       F#m               G#m         F#m      B      E
 All day long I hear him shouting so loud, he's crying out that he was framed</lyrics>

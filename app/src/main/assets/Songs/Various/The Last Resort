;The Eagles, from the album Hotel California

.E             A
 She came from Providence
.B                E
 The one in Rhode Island
.E                   A
 Where the old world shadows hang
.B            E
 Heavy in the air
.E              A
 She packed her hopes and dreams
.B          E
 Like a refugee
.E           A
 Just as her father came
.B          E  Esus4
 Across the sea

 She heard about a place
 People were smiling
 Spoke about the red man's ways
 How they loved the land
 They came from everywhere
 To the Great Divide
 Seeking a place to stand
 Or a place to hide

 Down in the crowded bars
 Out for a good time
 Can't wait to tell you all
 What it's like up there
 They called it paradise
 I don't know why
 Somebody laid the mountains low
 While the town got high

.E Esus4

.C#m C#

.E Esus4

.C#m C#

 When the chilly winds blew down
 Across the canyon
 Through the canyons of the coast
 To the malibus
 Where the pretty people played
 Hungry for power
 To light their neon ways
 Give 'em things to do

 Some rich man came and raped the land
 Nobody caught him
 Put up a bunch of ugly boxes
 And Jesus people bought them
 They called it paradise
 The place to be
 They watched the hazy sun
 Sinking in the sea

;(Key Change:  changes from E to G)

.G               C
 You can leave it all behind
.D          G
 Sail to Lahaina
.G                     C
 Just like the missionaries did
.D              G
 So many years ago
.G                  C
 They even brought a neon sign
.D          G
 Jesus is Coming
.G                      C
 Brought the white man's burden down
.D                       G    Gsus4
 Brought the white man's reign

 And we'll provide the grand design
 What is yours and what is mine
 'Cuz there is no more new frontier
 We have got to make it here
 We satisfied our endlees needs
 And justified our bloody deeds
 In the name of destiny
 And in the name of God

 And you can see them there
 On sunday morning
 Stand up and sing about
 What it's like up there
 They called it paradise
 I don't know why
 To call someplace paradise
 Kiss it goodbye

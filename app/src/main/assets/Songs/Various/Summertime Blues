;Intro riff:

.F                                                  Bb       C7        F
 I'm a gonna raise a fuss I'm a-gonna raise a holler                   
.F                                                        Bb       C7        F
 About a-workin' all summer just a-trying to earn a dollar                   
.      Bb
 Every time I call my baby, try to get a date
.              F
 The boss says "No dice son you gotta work a-late"
.    Bb
 Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
.          F                     C7         F        Bb       C7        F
 But there ain't no cure for the Summertime Blues                       

;repeat Intro riff

 Well my Mom and Pappa told me "Son you gotta earn some money
 If you wanna use the car to go a riding next Sunday"
 Well I didn't got to work told the boss I was sick
 "Now you can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick"
 Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
 But there ain't no cure for the Summertime Blues

;repeat Intro riff

 It's gonna take two weeks for I have my vacation,
 I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations.
 Well I told my congress man and he said, quote:
 "I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote"
 Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do,
 But there ain't no cure for the Summertime Blues.

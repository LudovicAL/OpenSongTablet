;Intro
.A            A7
              
.           A               A
 The reason why, oh I can't say
.                    E                    F#m  B
 I've got to let you go, girl, and right away  
.               A                 F#m   G
 After what you did, I can't stay on    
.                  A                E                  D      E
 And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone

 Baby, for a long time you had me believe
.                      E                                F#m  B
 That you love was all mine and that's the way it would be   
.             A                             F#m  G
 But I didn't know that you were putting me on   
.                  A                E                  D    G
 And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone 
.                A
 Oh, when you're gone.

 The reason why, oh I can't say
.                    E                    F#m  B
 I've got to let you go, girl, and right away  
.               A                 F#m   G
 After what you did, I can't stay on    
.                  A                E                  D      E
 And I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone   
.              A                E                  D      E
 I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone   
.              A                E                  D      E
 I'll probably feel a whole lot better when you're gone</lyrics>

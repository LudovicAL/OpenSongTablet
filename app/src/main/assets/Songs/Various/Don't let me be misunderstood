;The Animals

;Intro x2

 Baby, can you understand me now
 Sometimes I feel a little mad
 Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel
 When things go rough I feel real bad

;Chorus
 I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
 Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

;Intro x2

 Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
 With a joy that's hard to hide
 And othertimes it seems that, all I have to do is worry
 And then I know you're bound to see my other side

;Chorus

 If I seem edgy, I want you to know
 That I never mean to take it out on you
 Life has its problems and I get my share
 But that's one thing that I would never do
 'cos I love you

 Oh... Don't you know I'm human
 I got my thoughts like any other one
 Sometimes I find myself, Lord, regreting
 Some foolish thing - some simple thing I've done

;Chorus

;Intro

;Chorus

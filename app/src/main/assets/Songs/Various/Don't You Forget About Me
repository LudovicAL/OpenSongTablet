.E              D             A              D
 Won't you come see about me, I'll be alone. Dancing you know it baby
.E            D                    D                    D
 Tell me your troubles and doubts, giving me ev'rything inside and out
.E                  D                 A                          D
 Love's strange, so real in the dark, think of the tender things that we were working on
.E               D              A                     D
 Slow change may pull us apart, when the light gets into your heart baby

[C]
.E         D               A
 Don't you forget about me 
.D
 Don't, don't, don't, don't
.E         D               A
 Don't you forget about me 
[]

.C                        G
 Will you stand above me? look my way, never love me
.D                                       A
 Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling, down, down, down
.C                      G
 Will you recognize me? Call my name or walk on by
.D                                       A
 Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling, down, down, down

.E         D                A                        D
 Don't you try and pretend, it's my beginning, we'll win in the end, oh
.E           D                    A              D
 Harm you or touch your defences, vanity, insecurity.
.E            D             A              D
 Don't you forget about me, I'll be alone. Dancing you know it baby
.E        D               A                      D
 Going to take you apart, I'll put us back together at heart baby

;chorus

.D                  E
 As you walk on by, 
.D                A
 Will you call my name
.D                  E
 As you walk on by, 
.D                A
 Will you call my name
.D                  E         D         A
 When you walk away                     
.D
 Oh will you walk away</lyrics>

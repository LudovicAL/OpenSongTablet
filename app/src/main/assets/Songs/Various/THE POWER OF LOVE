;Intro
 C  C/E | F  G | C  C/E | F    G |
 Cm7    | F    | Cm7    | F Bb F |

.    Cm7                F
 The power of love is a curious thing
.Cm7                         F
 make a one man weep, make another man sing
.Cm7                F
 Change a hawk to a little white dove
.Cm7                 F                       F Gm7
 more than a feeling that's the power of love

 Tougher than diamonds, bricks like cream
 Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
 make a bad one good make a wrong one right
 power of love that keeps you home at night

;Chorus 1 :
.C              C/E    F          G
 You don't need money, don't take fame
.C             C/E           F         G
 Don't need no credit card to ride this train
.     C               C/E             F         G
 It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
.       Bb         F         Gsus4
 but it might just save your life
.G                   Cm7
 That's the power of love
.F                   Cm7    F     Bb F
 That's the power of love            

 First time you feel it, it might make you sad
 Next time you feel it it might make you mad
 But you'll be glad baby when you've found
 that's the power makes the world go'round

;Chorus 2 :
 And it don't take money,  don't take fame
 don't need no credit card to ride this train
 It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
 but it might just save your life

.Eb              G7             Cm7
   They say that all in love is fair
.          F9
 yeah, but you don't care
.Ab                Eb/G
   But you'll know what to do
.Fm7             Eb
    when it gets hold of you
.Ab                 Gsus4
   and with a little help from above
.G                       Cm7
  you feel the power of love
.F                       Cm7
  you feel the power of love
.F
  Can you feel it ?
.Cm7    F Cm7 Bb
    Hmmm

;Chorus 3 :
 It don't take money and it don't take fame
 don't need no credit card to ride this train
 Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
.C          C/E         F            G
  you won't feel nothin' till you feel
.C               C/E F           Gsus4
  you feel the power, just the power of love
.C             C/E F             Gsus4      C
  That's the power, that's the power of love
.F             G
  You feel the power of love
.C F             G            C
    you feel the power of love
.F         G            C C/E F Gsus4
  feel the power of love

.            E
 Pretty soon now
.                         A   E
 Y'know I'm gonna make a comeback
.              D             A           E
 And like the birds and the bees in the trees
.                  B   Am
 It's a sure-fire smash
.       E
 I'll speak
.                            A  E
 To the masses throught the media
.                  D         A     E
 And if you got anything to say to me
.                     B
 You can say it with cash
.C#m               A       C#m           A
 'cause I got the trash and you got the cash
.E                           B
 so baby we should get along fine
.C#m                   A            C#m                 A
 so give me all your money 'cause I know you think I'm funny
.B
 Can't you hear me laughing
.  D               A
 Can't you see me smile

;CHORUS
.         E            A            D           A
 I'm the man (I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man)
.         E        A            D    A
 I'm the man that gave you the hula-hoop
.         E            A            D            A
 I'm the man (I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man)
.         E         A           D
 I'm the man that gave you the yo-yo

 Kung fu
 That was one of my good ones
 Well what's a few broken bones
 When we all know it's good clean fun
 Skateboards
 I've almost made them respectable
 You see I can't always get through to you
 So I go for your son
 I had a giant rubber shark and it really made a mark
 Didja looka looka lookit alla blood
 Give me all your money etc.

;CHORUS

 Right Now
 I think I'm gonna plan a new trend
 Because the line on the graph's getting low
 And we can't have that
 And you think you're immune
 But I can sell you anything
 Anything from a thin safety pin
 To a pork pie hat
 'Cause I got the trash etc.

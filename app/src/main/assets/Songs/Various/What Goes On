;Lou Reed

;Verse 1
.D
 What goes on in your mind
.             C    G       D
 I think that I am falling down
.D
 What goes on in your mind
.             C    G      D
 I think that I am upside down

;Chorus
.        C                 G
 Lady be good, do what you should
.               D
 You know it'll work all right
.        C                 G
 Lady be good, do what you should
.               D
 You know it'll be all right

;Verse 2
 I'm goin' up, and I'm goin' down
 I'm gonna fly from side to side
 See the bells up in the sky
 Somebody cut the  string in two

;Verse 3
 One minute one, and one minute two
 One minute up, and one minute down
 What goes on in your mind
 I think that I am falling down

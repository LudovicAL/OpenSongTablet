;Intro
.A             D              A
                              
;Chorus
.   D                                      A
 Oh Carol  don't let him steal your heart away
.    E                          D                      A
 I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

.     A
 Come into my machine so we can cruise on out
 I know a swinging little joint where we can jump and shout
.             D
 It's not too far back on the highway, not too long a ride
.              A
 you park your car in the open, you can walk inside
.         E
 A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'm
.             A
 'cause every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed

;Chorus

.            A
 Well if you wanna hear some music like the boys are playin'
 hold tight, tap your foot, don't let it carry you away
.              D
 Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
.        A
 why the music will treat you when they get a crowd
.     E
 Well you can dance, I know you would, you could
.         A
 I got my eyes on you baby 'cause you dance so good

.A             D             A

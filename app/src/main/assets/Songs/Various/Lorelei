;The Pogues

.    E
 You told me tales of love and glory
.A
 Same old sad song, same old story
.E             C#m
 Sirens sing a lullaby
.    G#m              B
 And no one knows but Lorelei

 Castles out of fairy tales
 Timbers shiver where once there sailed
 A lovesick man who caught her eye
 And no one knew but Lorelei

;CHORUS:
.F#m
 River, river have mercy
.        B
 Take me down to the sea
.    F#m
 For if I perish on these rocks
.   B
 My love no more I'll see

 I've thought of you in far-off places
 Puzzled over lipstick traces
 So help me God, I will not try
 And then I think of Lorelei
 I've traveled far and wandered wide
 An old photograph of you beside me
 Old Man River seems so shy (?)
 And he remembers Lorelei

;CHORUS

 If I should float upon this stream
 And see you in my madman's dream
 I'd sink into your troubled eyes
 And none would know save Lorelei

;CHORUS

 But if my ship which sails tomorrow
 Should crash against these rocks, my sorrows
 I will drown, before I die
 It's you I'll see, not Lorelei
.    E
 I-I-I

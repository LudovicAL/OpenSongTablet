;Intro
.    F      F5+          Dm         F5+
 Our life together is so precious together.
.        F      C7       F
 We have grown,  we have grown.
.C7           F             F5+      Dm      F7
 Although our love is still special,         lets take a
.                 Bb
 chance and fly a way
.    Bbm    F
 somewhere alone.

[C
.     F
 It's been too long since we took the time.
.   F5+                                  Gm      C
 No one's to blame. I know time flies so quickly.
.Gm         C              Am
 But when I see you darlin',
.             D                   Gm
 it's like we both are falling in love again.
.      C                     F     F5+      F
 It'll be just like starting over, starting over.
[

 Every day we used to make it, love.
 Why can't we be makin' love nice and easy?
 It's time to spread our wings and fly;
 don't let another day go by, my love.
 It'll be just like starting over, starting over.

;Bridge
.Cm7                     Fm     Bb7
 why don't we take off alone,   take a trip somewhere far,
.Cm7
 far away?
.Cm                      Fm       Bb7
 We'll be together all alone again, like we used to in the
.Cm7
 early days.
.C           Bb   C
 Well, well, darliin'.

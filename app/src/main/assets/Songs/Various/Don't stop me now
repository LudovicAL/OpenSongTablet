.   F                      Am7           Dm7
 Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time
.        Gm7 C7         F              F7    Bb
 I feel alive, and the world, turning inside out, yeah
.     Gm7               D7           Gm    Dm  Gm Gm7
 and floating around in ecstasy, so don't stop me now
. Gm    Dm  Gm                                C7
 Don't stop me 'cause I'm having a good time, having a good time.

.       F                                Am7           Dm7
 I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky, like a tiger
.              Gm7         C7
 defying the laws of grafity
.       F                  Am                Dm
 I'm a racing car, passing by, like lady Godiva
.         Gm         C7                   F
 I'm gonna go, go, go,there's no stopping me
.     F7                  Bb         Gm7
 I'm burning through the sky, yeah, 200 degrees,
.                D7                   Gm
 that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
.     D7                         Gm7
 I'm travelling at the speed of light.
.                Bb                      C
 I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

. F     Gm  F  Dm                      Gm7           C7
 Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
. F     Gm  F  Dm                       Gm7             D7
 Don't stop me now, if you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
.Gm    Dm   Gm7
 Don't stop me cause I'm having a good time
.Gm    Dm   Gm7                               C7                    Eb
 Don't stop me, yes I'm having a good time, I don't want to stop at all

 I'm a rocket ship, on my way to mars, on a collision course
 I am a satellite, I'm out of control
 I'm a sexmachine, ready to reload, like an atombomb
 about to oh, oh, oh, oh, to explode
 I'm burning through ....

.N.C.
 Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me, hey hey hey
 Don't stop me, don't stop me, oh oh oh
 Don't stop me, don't stop me, have a good time, good time
 Don't stop me, don't stop me, Ahhhhh

;I'm burning through ...

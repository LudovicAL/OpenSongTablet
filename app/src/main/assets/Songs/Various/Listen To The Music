;Capo 8th fret

;Intro

.G                                 C/G
 Don't you feel it growing, day by day
.G                                Em
 People are getting ready for the news
.         D               C
 Some are happy, some are sad
.                              G           C/G
 Oh, we're gonna let the music play        

.G                                               C/G
 What the people need is a way to make them smile
.G                                  Em
 It ain't so hard to do if you know how
.             D                  C
 Got to get a message, get it on through
.                                  G
 Lord, now mamma, don't you ask me why

;Chorus
.     Em7                C
 Oohohooh, listen to the music
.     Em7                C
 Oohohooh, listen to the music
.     Em7                C
 Oohohooh, listen to the music
.        A    C
 All the time 

 Well I know, you know better, everything I say
 Leave me in the country for a day
 We'll be happy and we'll dance
 Oh, we're gonna dance the blues away

 And if I'm feeling good to you and you're feeling good to me
 There ain't nothing we can do or say
 Feeling good, feeling fine,
 Oh baby, let the music play

;Chorus

.G                   F      C/G                        G
 Like a lazy flowing river, surrounding castles in the sky
.G                        F
 And the crowd is growing bigger,
 Listening for the happy sounds
 Gonna have to let them go----

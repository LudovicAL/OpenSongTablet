 County or Arma geddon?
.G                    F                 F     F Em
 Seems like I've been down this road be fore. 
.Dm           Dm                 Am
 Is there any truth in that, Sen or?

.Am      Am      Am       Em      Em
     Sen or,          Sen or,           do you

 How long we gonna be riding?
.G                       F                    F Em
 How long must I keep my eyes ??? to the door?
.Dm                Dm                 Am
 Will there be any comfort there, Sen or?

.Am          C                 C               E
     Is that wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck?
.E           F                F                   Am
     Is that iron cross still hangin' down from a round your neck?
.Am          C                   C               E
     Is that marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot,
.E             F              F                          Am
     where she held me in her arms one time and said for get me not?

.Am      Am      Am       Em      Em
     Sen or,          Sen or,           I can
.F                C
 see that painted wagon, smell the
.Em          Am     Am
 tail of the dragon.
.G                 F            F         F Em
 I can't stand the suspense any more.     Can you
.Dm             Dm                Am
 tell me who to contact here, Sen or?

.E            F                  F                   Am
     Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a ???
.Am        C            C                E
     and a gypsy with a broken bag and a flashing ring
.E        F                F                         Am

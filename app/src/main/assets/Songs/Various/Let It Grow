.Bm              F#7        D                  E     G
 Standing at the crossroads trying to read the signs to tell me
.A                  Bm             F#7        D              E
 Which way I should go to find the answer and all the time I know,
.           G        A      B
 Plant your love and let it grow.

;Chorus
.B                         E      B              A
 Let it grow, let it grow, let it blossom let it flow
.       B                                E       B      A        F#7
 In the sun, the rain, the snow, love is lovely  let it grow     

.Bm            F#7       D               E     G      A
 Looking for a reason to check out an my mind, trying hard to get a
.Bm                F#7                   D               E
 Friend that I can count on, but there's nothing left to show,
.           G        A      B
 Plant your love and let it grow

;Chorus

.Bm              F#7              D               E        G       A
 Time is getting shorter, there's much for you to do, only ask and you will
.Bm               F#7          D             E
 Get what you are needing, the rest is up to you,
.           G        A      B
 Plant your love and let it grow

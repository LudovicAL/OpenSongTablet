.  A         G       D   A       G         D
 You're the real thing, yeah the real thing
.  A         G       D
 You're the real thing
.  A                   G        D A
 Even better than the real thing

 Give me one last chance and I'm gonna make you sing
 Give me half a chance to ride on the waves that you bring
 You're honey child to a swarm of bees
 Gonna blow right through you like a breeze
 Give me one last dance, we'll slide down the surface of things

 You're the real thing, yeah the real thing
 You're the real thing
 Even better than the real thing

.        D               G
 We're free to fly the crimson sky
.     D                  G
 The sun won't melt our wings tonight
. A   G   D
 Oh now, here she comes

 Take me higher, take me higher
 Can you take me higher?
 Will you take me higher?

 You're the real thing, yeah the real thing
 You're the real thing

 Even better than the real thing
 Even better than the real thing
 Even better than the real thing.

;Solo

 Have you come here for forgiveness?
 Have you come to raise the dead?
 Have you come here to play Jesus
 To the lepers in your head?

 Did I ask too much, more than a lot
 You gave me nothing, now it's all I got

 We're one, but we're not the same
 We hurt each other then we do it again</lyrics>

;Use heavy distortion and make the slides heard.

.     A
 I'm ready, ready for the laughing gas
.     G     D                    A
 I'm ready, ready for what's next
 Ready to duck, ready to dive
 Ready to say I'm glad to be alive
.     G     D                    A
 I'm ready, I'm ready for the push
 In the cool of the night, the warmth of the breeze
.        G              D        A
 I'll be crawling around on my hands and knees

.                       Gadd9    D    A
 She's just down the line ... Zoo Station
.                       Gadd9    D    A
 Got to make it on time ... Zoo Station

 I'm ready, I'm ready for the gridlock
 I'm ready to take it to the street
 Ready for the shuffle, ready for the deal
 Ready to let go of the steering wheel
 I'm ready, ready for the crush

 She's just down the line ... Zoo Station
 Got to make it on time ... Zoo Station

 Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
 It's alright...it's alright...it's alright...it's alright
 Hey baby...hey baby...hey baby...hey baby
 it's alright, it's alright

. D/A                        A
 Time is a train, makes the future the past
.             G               D
 Leaves you standing in the station
.       A
 Your face pressed up against the glass

 I'm just down the line from your love...Zoo Station
 Under the sign of your love...Zoo Station
 I'm gonna be there...Zoo Station
 Tracing the line...Zoo Station
 I'm gonna make it on time...make it on time...Zoo Station
 Just two stops down the line...Zoo Station
 Just a stops down the line...Zoo Station</lyrics>

.Gm                          Eb
 How high the gulls fly o'er Islay.
.Gm                           F
 How sad the farm lad deep in play.
.Eb          F             Gm
 Felt like a grain on your sand.

.Gm                              Eb
 How well the sheep's bell music makes.
.Gm                          F
 Rovin' the cliff when fancy takes.
.Eb            F            Gm
 Felt like the tide left me here.

.Gm                               Eb
 How blest the forest with birds' song.
.Gm                            F
 How neat the cut peat laid so long.
.Eb          F             Gm
 Felt like a seed on your land.

.Gm                          Eb
 How high the gulls fly o'er Islay.
.Gm                           F
 How sad the farm lad deep in play.
.Eb            F            Gm
 Felt like the tide left me here.
.Eb          F             Gm
 Felt like a grain on your sand.
.Eb          F             Gm
 Felt like a grain on your sand.</lyrics>

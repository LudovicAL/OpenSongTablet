.G         D               Am
 Mama take this badge from me
.G                 D      C
 'Cause I can't use it anymore
.G                 D            Am
 It's getting dark, too dark to see
.G              D                    C
 feels like I'm knocking on heaven's door

.C
 hay hay  -   hay hay hay
.G             D                    C
 knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
 knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
 knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
 knock, knock, knocking on heaven's do-o-or

 Mama put those guns to the ground
 'Cause I can't shoot them anymore
 That cold black cloud is comin' down
 Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

 hay hay  -  hay hay hay

 knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
 knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
 knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
 knock, knock, knocking on heaven's do-o-or.</lyrics>

;Intro:
.BEBEBEBEG#m D#m G#m D#m E F# E F#
                
.B               E      B                  E
  Nicky's in the corner, with a black coat on
.B               E        B                E
  Running from a bad home, with some cat inside
.B                  E        B                E
  Now where did you find her, among the neon lights
.B                 E                      B          E
  That haunt the streets outside, she says stay with me
.F#         G#m             E
  Beautiful girl (stay with me)
.F#         G#m             E
  Beautiful girl (stay with me)
.C#m           E
  She wanna go home

.B                E       B                 E
  From doorway to doorway, street corner to corner
.B     E                  B        E              B
  Neon ghosts in the city, and she says stay with me
;same chords as intro
 Stay with me
 Stay with me
 Stay with me

;same chords as first stanza and chorus
 She's so scared, so very frightened
 Anything can happen, right here tonight
 Beautiful girl (stay with me)
 Beautiful girl (stay with me)
 She wanna go home

.B          E
  Stay with me (beautiful girl)
.B          E
  Stay with me (beautiful girl)
.B          E
  Stay with me (beautiful girl)
.B         E                  B</lyrics>

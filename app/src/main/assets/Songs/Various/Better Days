.E
 Well my soul checked out missin' as I sat listenin'
.E                                 C#m
 To the hours and minutes tickin' away.
.           F#m
 Yeah, just sittin around waitin' for my life to begin
.F#m                             A
 While it was all just slippin' away
.         E
 Well I'm tired of waitin' for tomorrow to come
.E                                        C#m
 For the train to come rollin' 'round the bend
.        F#m
 I got a new suit of clothes and a pretty red rose
.F#m                   A
 A women I can call my friend

;CHORUS 1:
.A                E
 These are Better Days, baby
.E                                 A
 Yeah, there's Better Days shinin' through
.A                E
 These are Better Days, baby
.       F#m         A         E
 Better Days with a girl like you

.E
 Well I took a piss at fortune's sweet kiss
.E                              C#m
 It's like eatin' cavier in the dirt
.       F#m
 It's a sad funny ending when you find yourself pretending
.F#m                              A
 To be a rich man in a poor man's shirt
.       E
 Now my ass was draggin from a passin' gypsy wagon
.E                         C#m
 Your heart like a diamond shown
.       F#m
 Tryin' to lay it in your arms, count the lucky charms
 Get out of these hard luck bones

;CHORUS 2:
.A                E
 These are Better Days, baby
.E                                 A
 Yeah, there's Better Days shinin' through
.A                E
 These are Better Days, baby
.       A        B       E
 Better Days are shining through

 (Instrumental bridge):   A    C#m        F#m      A    E

.E
 Now a life of leisure, and a pirate's treasure
.E                        C#m
 Don't make much for tragedy.
.       F#m
 It's a sad man, my friend, whose livin' in his own skin,
.F#m                      A
 And can't stand the company.
.      E
 Every fools got a reason to feel sorry for himself
.E                        C#m
 And turning his heart to stone
.          F#m
 Drag this fool half way to heaven, just a mile on to hell
.F#m                        A
 And I feel like I'm comin' home!

.A        D
          
.D                               A
 Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh
.                                      D
 Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
.                                   A
 My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh
.                                         D
 Son of a gun, we'll have good fun on the bayou

;CHORUS
.D                                      A
 Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and-a fillet gumbo
.                                        D
 'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my machez amio
.                                   A
 Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
.                                        D
 Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

;Instrumental Verse (Fiddle solo)

.D                                        A
 Thibay-deaux, Fountaineaux, the place is buzzin'
.                                  D
 Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
.                                   A
 Dress in style, go hog wild, me oh my oh
.                                        D
 Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

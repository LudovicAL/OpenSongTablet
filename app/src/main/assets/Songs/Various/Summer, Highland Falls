;Intro:
.F(no3)   Fmaj7    Gm7    Bb+2
 -------- -------- ------ -------
.Am7      C        Bb+2
 -------- -------- ------

.                 F                 Fmaj7
 They say that these are not the best of times
.    Gm7                Bb+2                FFmaj7 Gm7 Bb+
 But they're the only times I've ever known    
.        F                Fmaj7         Gm7
 And I believe there is a time for meditation
.     Bb+2                CG
 In cathedrals of our own  
.A7       Dm               C            Bb+2
 Now I've seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes
.    G7sus      G7              Csus
 And I can only stand apart and sympathize
.           Bb              F            Gm7
 For we are always what our situations hand us
.            C         Bb+2      Eb B
 It's either sadness or euphoria  

 So we'll argue and we'll compromise
 And realize that nothing's ever changed
 For all our mutual experience
 Out separate conclusions are the same.
 Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
 Our reason coexists with our insanity
 And though we choose between reality and madness
 It's either sadness or euphoria

.    Dm               C             Bb+2
 How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
.   G7sus            G7                Csus
 Perhaps we don't fulfill each other's fantasies
.          Bb             F             Gm7
 And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives
.           C            Bb+2     Eb B
 With our respective similarities  
.            C         F
 It's either sadness or euphoria.</lyrics>

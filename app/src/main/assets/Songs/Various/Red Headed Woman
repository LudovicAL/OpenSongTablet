 Well brunettes are fine man
 And blondes are fun
 But when it comes to getting a dirty job done

.            A
 I'll take a red headed woman
.  E
 A red headed woman
.           B7
 It takes a red headed woman
.                   E
 To get a dirty job done

 Well listen up stud
 Your life's been wasted
 Til you've got down on your knees and tasted

.  A
 A red headed woman
.  E
 A red headed woman
.           B7
 It takes a red headed woman
.                   E
 To get a dirty job done

.A
 Tight skirt, strawberry hair
.E
 Tell me what you've got, baby, waiting under there
.A
 Big green eyes that look like, son
.         E                     B7            E
 They can see every cheap thing that you ever done

 Well, I don't know how many girls you dated, man
 But you ain't lived til you've had your tires rotated

.     A
 By a red headed woman
.  E
 A red headed woman
.           B7
 It takes a red headed woman
.                   E
 To get a dirty job done

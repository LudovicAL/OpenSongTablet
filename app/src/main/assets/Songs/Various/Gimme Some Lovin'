.E        A/E                         E           A/E
 Well, my temperature's rising and my feet on the floor
.E         A/E                       E            A/E
 Twenty people knockin cause they're wanting some more
.E         A/E           E                A/E
 Let me in baby, I don't know what you've got
.          E           A/E      E             A/E
 But you'd better take it easy, this place is hot

;Chorus
.E          G          A          C
 So glad we made it,   so glad we made it
.           E          A/E    E          A/E            E
 You gotta  gimme some lovin, gimme some lovin,         
.           A/E          E
 Gimme some lovin, every day

.E      A/E                     E        A/E
 Well I feel so good everything sounding hot
.E              A/E            E           A/E
 Better take it easy cause the place is on fire
.E           A/E        E                  A/E
 Been a hard day, and I don't know what to do
.E             A/E           E         A/E
 Wait a minute baby it could happen to you

;Chorus

.E      A/E                E             A/E
 Well I feel so good, everybody's gettin high
.E              A/E            E           A/E
 Better take it easy cause the place is on fire
.E           A/E         E        A/E
 Been a hard day, nothin went too good,
.E             A/E           E         A/E
 Now I'm gonna relax, honey, everybody should

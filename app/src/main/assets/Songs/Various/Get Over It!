;Hell Freezes Over (MTV)

.  D
 I turn on the tube
 What do I see
 A whole lotta people
 Cryin' Don't blame me;They point their
 Crooked little fingers
 At everybody else
 Spend all of their time
 Feeling Sorry for themselves
.G
 Victim of this
 Victim of that

.     A
 Your momma's too thin and
 Your daddy's too fat!

.    D
 Get over it (Hit a 10th fret D on the E string)
.    F
 Get over it (Hit a 10th fret D on the E string)

.         G
 All this whinin', cryin'
 Pitchin' a fit

.    D
 Get over it  (Hit a 10th fret D on the E string)
 Get over it!

;Break

.             D
 You said you haven't been the same
 Since you had your little crash
 But you might feel better
 If they gave you some cash
 The more I think about it
 Old Billy was right
 Let's kill all the lawyers
 Kill 'em tonight!

.G
 Don't wanna work
 You want to live like a king

.        A
 But the big bad world
 Doesn't owe you a thing

.    D
 Get over it
.    F
 Get over it

.       G
 If you don't want to play
 Then you might as well split

.    D
 Get over it
 Get over it

;Slide Solo
 D---F---G---D
 Hook

.          C
 It's like goin' to confession

.                      D
 Every time I hear you speak

.       G
 You're makin' the most
 Of your losin' streak

.A
 Some call it sick
 I call it weak
 Yeah, Yeah Yeah!

.       D
 You're draggin' around
 Like a ball and chain
 You wallow in the guilt
 You wallow in the pain
 You wave it like a flag
 You wear it like a crown
 Got your mind in the gutter
 Bringin' everybody down

.    G
 You bitch about the present
 Blame it on the past

.            A
 I'd like to find your inner child
 And kick it's little ass!

.    D
 Get over it
.    F
 Get over it

.         G
 All this bitchin' and moanin'
 And pitchin' a fit

.    D
 Get over it
 Get over it

 Get over it
.    F
 Get over it

.     G
 It's gotta stop sometime
 So why don't you quit

.    D
 Get over it
 Get over it.

;Intro:
.Am   G#+  C    D    Fmaj7G  Am
                             
.          Am         G#+           C           D
 There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
.          Fmaj7                G  Am
 and she's buying a stairway to heaven
.         Am             G#+          C              D
 When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
.       Fmaj7                     G    Am
 with a word she can get what she came for
.C  D  Fmaj7  Am        C        G           D
 Oh___ oh____ and she's buying a stairway to heaven
.          C           D            Fmaj7       Am
 There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
.           C              D              Fmaj7
 'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings

.     Am          G#+             C            D
 In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
.          Fmaj7                   G  Am
 Sometimes all of her thoughts are misgiven

.Am   G#+  C    D    Fmaj7G  Am
                             
.G/B Am7  Dsus4D                 Am7      Em D  C   D
               Oh___ it makes me wonder             
.Am7   Dsus4 D             Am7  Em   D    C    D
 Oh___ it  makes me wonder                     

.          C         G          Am
 There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
.       C         G          F  Am
 and my spirit is crying for leaving
.      C               G             Am
 In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
.        C         G               F  Am
 and the voices of those who stand looking
.Am7  Dsus4    D                  Am7  Em   D    C    D
         Oh___ it makes me wonder                     
.Am7  Dsus4 D                    Am7  Em   D    C    D
 Oh___ it really makes me wonder                     

 And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
 then the piper will lead us to reason
 And the new day will dawn for those who stand long
 and the forest will echo with laughter

 If theres a bristle in your hedgerow dont be alarmed now
 it's just a spring clean for the May queen
 Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run
 there's still time to change the road you're on

 Your head is humming and it wont go in case you dont know
 the pipers calling you to join him
 Dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know
 your stairway lies on the whispering wind

.D    Dsus2D    Dsus4 D    Dsus2D    Dsus4C    Cadd9C    Cadd9C
                                                              

;For the solo and the remaining lyrics use a Am  G  F  G  barre chord sequence

;Solo

 And as we wind on down the road
 Our shadows taller than our soul
 There walks the lady we all know
 Who shines white light and wants to know
 how everything still turns to gold
 And if you listen very hard
 the time will come to you at last
 When all are one and one is all
 To be a rock and not to roll

.          Fmaj7             G  Am
 And she's buying a stairway to heaven</lyrics>

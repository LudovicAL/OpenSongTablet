;Counting Crows
;Unreleased Demo

.E
 In the still water she lies down
.D
 Shaking in the press of sunlight
.A
 We rolled into Lexington
.E
 She shakes off the drop of daylight

.E
 Water beading up her chest
.D
 Bleeding down between her knees
.A
 Rivers in Kentucky flow
.E
 Between the bluegrass wavy seas

.D       E
 But oh, Marjorie
.D                A                   E
 Twists the knife once more inside of me

 Breathless with anticipation
 Baited breathers set their hooks
 Tuck their heads beneath the high grass
 And lie and wait beside the brooks

 (the first two lines run together with the first two words said real rapidly)
 For instance? pushing slowly through
 Frustration leading back along
 The alleys of a childhood
 Will not release us willingly

 But oh, Marjorie
 Sticks the knife in while I heard the sea

;solo
.F#m B?
     (repeat)

 Dust me off and shut me down
 And dream of where I haven't been
 Close the door inside my heart
 Stuck in the south Atlantic wind

 I have hollow eyes
 Haunting only to myself
 Even so, I can't stop calling
 This great big hollows in my self

 I took the train form California
 To the far side of the continent
 Woke up in Kentucky
 Where a wedding was about to end

 I looked up at Anna
 She turned back to look at me
 It's best to kill the ones that matter
 Render blind the ones who see

 But oh, Marjorie
 Takes the blade and walks away from me
 Oh, Marjorie
 Love like blood is pouring out of me
 Oh, Marjorie
 My heart won't stop bleeding over me baby

;solo over F#m and B?

 Oh, I can't shut it in
 It's got far too many doors to block the wind
 Oh, I can't shut it in
 It's got far too many doors to block the wind</lyrics>

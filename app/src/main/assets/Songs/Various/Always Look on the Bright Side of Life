.     Am                 D7
 Some things in life are bad
.         G               Em
 they can really make you mad
. Am                D7                G    Em
 other things just make you swear and curse
.            Am               D7
 when you're chewing on large gristle
.      G                  Em
 don't grumble - give a whistle
.      A7                                  D
 and whistles help things turn out for the best

[C]
.     G      Em           Am    D7      G    Em        Am   D7
 And always look at the bright side of life (fl\370jt..........)
. G      Em          Am    D7      G    Em        Am   D7
 always look on the light side of life (fl\370jt..........)

.   Am               D7
 If life seems jolly rotten
.        G                   Em
 there's something you've forgotten
.    Am                  D7                  G   Em
 and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
.              Am            D7
 when you are feeling in the dumps
.G                Em
 don't be silly chumsï¿½
.     A7                                     D
 just purse your lips and whistle that's the thing

;Chorus

.    Am              D7
 For life is quite absurd
.    G                 Em
 and death's the final word
.         Am              D7             G  Em
 you must always face the curtain with a bow
.   Am             D7
 forget about your sin
.         G          Em
 give the audience a grin
.  A7                           D
 enjoy it's your last chance anyhow

[C]
.    G      Em           Am    D7      G      Em        Am   D7
 So always look on the bright side of death  (fl\370jt..........)
. G     Em       Am        D7        G       Em        Am   D7
 just before you draw your terminal breath. (fl\370jt..........)

. Am                 D7
 Life's a piece of shit
.G                Em
 when you look at it
. Am                D7                    G   Em
 life's a laugh and death's a joke - it's true
.Am                 D7
 you see it's all a show
.          G               Em
 keep them laughing as you go
.       A7                               D7
 just remember that the last laugh is on you

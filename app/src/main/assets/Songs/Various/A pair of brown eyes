.      G                             Am               C
 One summer evening drunk to hell I sat there nearly lifeless
.     G                                    C           Am
 An old man in the corner sang where the waterlilies grow
.     G                           Am                  C
 And on the jukebox Johnny sang about a thing called love
.          G           Am
 and it's how are you kid
.      C          G
 and whats your name
.     C                    Am
 and how would you bloody know

 In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky
 I lay down on the ground
 And the arms and legs of other men
 Were scattered all around
 Some cursed some prayed some prayed then cursed
 Then prayed and bled some more
 And the only thing that I could see
.        G             Am             C        G
 Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
.     G             Am             C        G
 But when we got back labelled parts one to three
.        G             Am             C        G
 There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me
.        G       Am       C           G
 And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
.        G       Am       C           G
 And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
.        G       Am       C           G
 And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
.        C             Am
 For a pair of brown eyes
.        C      D      G
 For a pair of brown eyes

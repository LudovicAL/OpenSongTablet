;From "Burn", 1974

;Key: B flat

;Intro:  Gm

.    Gm
 The sky is red, I don't understand;
.F/G
 past midnight I still see the land.
.  Gm
 People are sayin' the woman is damned,
. C                                         Gm
 she makes you burn with a wave of her hand.___

 The city's ablaze, the town's on fire;
.     F/G
 the woman's flames are reachin' higher.
.Gm
 We were fools, we called her "liar";
.Bb  F  C       Gm     Eb   C    Gm
 All I hear is "Burn!"_____________

 I didn't believe she was devil's sperm;
 she said, "Curse you all, you'll never learn!
 When I leave there's no return!"
 The people laughed till she said, "Burn!"___
 Warning came, no one cared;
 earth was shakin', we stood and stared.
 When it came no one was spared;
 Still I hear "Burn!"______________

.Dm                       Bb
       You know we had no time,
.                 Am         Bb
 we could not even try,______
.                   Dm   Bb/D C/D Gm
 You know we had no time.

 The sky is red, I don't understand;
 past midnight, I still see the land.
 People are sayin' the woman is damned;
 she makes you burn with a wave of her hand.
 Warning came, no one cared;
 earth was shakin, we stood and stared.
 When it came no one was spared.
 Still I hear "Burn!"</lyrics>

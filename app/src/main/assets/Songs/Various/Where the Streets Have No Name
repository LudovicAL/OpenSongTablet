.D
 I want to run, I want to hide
.                                           G
 I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside
.                Bm                A
 I want to reach out and touch the flame
.          Csus9
 Where the streets have no name

.D
 I want to feel, sunlight on my face
.                                        G
 See that dust cloud disappear without a trace
.               Bm                      A
 I want to take shelter from the poison rain
.          Csus9
 Where the streets have no name

;chorus
[C
 Where the streets have no name
 Where the streets have no name
 We're still building
 Then burning down love - burning down love
 And when I go there, I go there with you...
 It's all I can do
[

 The city's a flood and our love turns to rust
 We're beaten and blown by the wind - Trampled in dust
 I'll show you a place high on the desert plain
 Where the streets have no name

;chorus

.D
 Our love turns to rust
.                     G
 And we're beaten and blown by the wind
 Blown by the wind
.             D
 Oh and I see love
 See our love turn to rust
 And we're beaten and blown by the wind
.    G
 Blown by the wind
.         Bm                     A
 Oh when I go there, I go there with you
.               D
 It's all I can do</lyrics>

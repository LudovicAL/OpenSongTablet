;chorus
[C
.      D
 Well, that'll be the day, when you say goodbye.
.     A
 Yes, that'll be the day, when you make me cry.
.    D
 You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
.       A                  E7     A
 'Cause that'll be the day when I die.
[

.          D                                A
 Well, you give me all your loving and your turtle doving,
.D                                 A
 All your hugs and kisses and your money too,
.      D                          A
 Well, you know you love me baby, until you tell me, maybe,
.Bm                  E7
 That some day, well I'll be through.

.      D                        A
 Well, when Cupid shot his dart he shot it at your heart
.D                      A
 So if we ever part and I leave you.
.D                           A
 You sit and hold me and you tell me boldly
 That some day, well I'll be blue.

 That'll be the day, woo hoo.

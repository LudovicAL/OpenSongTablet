;note this derives from two sources who differed in the chords;
;I decided to give them here both, devided by a bar (|)

;Intro (same as chorus)
 A - Em - G6/C -  G - D    (2x)

.Bm
 Came in from a rainy thursday
.A|D       Em|A
 on the avenue
.Bm                          A|D       Em|A
 thought I heard you talking softly    
.Bm
 I turned on the lights, the tv
.A|D         Em|A
 and the radio
.Bm                                A|D   Em|A
 still I can't escape the ghost of you   

.Bm                          F#m
 What is happened to it all? Crazy, some say
.C#m7|A                         G|D
 Where is the life that I recognize? (Gone away)

;chorus
[C
.A                         Em
 But I won't cry for yesterday
.                     G6/C|G
 there's an ordinary world
.        G|D         D|A
 somehow I have to find
.A                        Em
 And as I try to make my way
.                 G6/C|G
 to the ordinary world
.        G|D         D
 I will learn to survive
[

;Break (Bm)

 Passion or coincidence
 once prompted you to say
 "Pride will tear us both apart"
 Well now pride's gone out the window
 cross the rooftops, runaway
 left me in the vacuum of my heart

 What is happening to me? Crazy, some say
 Where is my friend when I need you most? (Gone away)

;chorus

 Papers in the roadside
 tell of suffering and greed
 feared today, forgot tomorrow
 ooh, here beside the news
 of holy war and holy need
 ours is just a little sorrowed talk

 (Just blowing away)

;chorus

 every world is my world (I will learn to survive)
 any world is my world (I will learn to survive)
 any world is my world
 every world is my world</lyrics>

.E                                A                                      F#
 Sitting in a park in Paris France  reading the news and it sure looks bad
.                           B
 They won't give peace a chance, that was just a dream some of us had
.E                A                                  F#
 Stole a lot of lines to sing but I wouldn't want to stay here
.                            B                     A
 It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here
. Asus4      A            E        C#
 Ah but California, California I'm coming home
.A                            E                         B Bsus2
 I'm gonna see the folks I dig I'll even kiss a sunset pig
. A              E
 California I'm coming home

.  E
 I met a redneck on a Grecian isle, we did the goat dance very well
 He gave me back my smile but he kept my camera to sell
 Oh the rogue, the red red rogue, he cooked good omelettes and stews
 And I might have stayed on with him there, but my heart cried out for you
 California, Oh California I'm coming home
 Oh make me feel good rock and roll band, I'm your biggest fan
 California I'm coming home

;BRIDGE:
.E            F#       A                     E
 Oh it gets so lonely     When you're walking
.                             B
 And the streets are full of strangers
.                 F#           A                  D
 All the news of home you read just give you the blues
.B                 B7   Asus4 A Asus2 A
 Just give you the blues

 So I bought me a ticket I caught a plane to Spain
 Went to a party down a red dirt road
 There were lots of pretty people there, reading Rolling Stone reading Vogue
 They said how long can you hang around, I said a week maybe two
 Just until my skin turns brown and then I'm going home
 To California, California, I'm coming home
 Oh, will you take me as I am, strung out on another man
 California I'm coming home

;BRIDGE #2:
.E              F#    A                     E
 Oh it gets so lonely    when you're walking
.                             B
 And the streets are full of strangers
.                F#        A                    E                  B
 All the news of home you read, more about the war and the bloody changes
. F#                      A                         E
 Oh will you take me as I am, will you take me as I am
.        B                      F# A
 Will you, will you take me as I am
.             E            B               F#    A   E   B
 Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm, take me as I am ......

; NOTE: Perhaps this song really goes like the F tuning in an earlier
; posting, but I tend to break strings trying to get there.  I prefer
; this version most of the time.  The riffs are just rough approximations
; seeing how they are actually played in another tuning anyways.

.      D              A       G            F#m
 There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range,
.     Bm            G              D       F#m
 His horse and his cattle are his only companions,
.    Bm           G              D            F#m
 He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons,
. G            D          A           Em7   A7
 Waiting for summer, his pastures to change.
.    G                 A7sus           D
 And as the moon rises he sits by his fire,
.  Bm             G         D         A
 Thinking about women and glasses of beer,
.      G                     A7sus      D
 And closing his eyes as the doggies retire,
.    Bm          G             D
 He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear,
. E7sus       E7          Asus    A
 As if maybe someone could hear.  

;Chorus:
.         D             G        A7sus     D      Bm           G          D
 He says goodnight you moonlight ladies,          rock-a-bye sweet baby James,
. Bm               G             D                        E7sus                 Asus
 Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose, won't you let me go down in my dreams,
.     G        A7sus       D
 And rock-a-by sweet baby James.

 Well the first of December was covered with snow,
 And so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston,
 The Birkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frostin',
 With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go.
 There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway,
 A song that they sing when they take to the sea,
 A song that they sing of their home in the sky,
 Maybe you can believe it, if it helps you to sleep,
 But singing works just fine for me.

;Chorus.</lyrics>

;Intro

.E           B           C#m          B   A
 Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
.E          B         C#m    A
 Sometimes Ifeel like my only friend
.      E      B           C#m     B  A
 Is the city I live in the City of Angels
.E        B
 Lonely as I am
.  C#m      A    Emaj7
 Together we cry 

 I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
 I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
 She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
 I never worry
 Now that is a lie.

[C
;chorus 1
.            F#m..    E
 I don't ever want to feel

 It's hard to believe there's nobody out there
 It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
 At least I got her love the city she loves me
 Lonely as I am
 Together we cry

.A.                   C
 Under the bridge downtown
.G6        Fmaj7
 Is where I drew some blood
.A.                   C
 Under the bridge downtown
.G6         Fmaj7
 I could not get enough
.A.                   C
 Under the bridge downtown
.G6      Fmaj7
 Forgot about my love
.A.                   C
 Under the bridge downtown
.G6       Fmaj7
 I gave my life away

 Ay___Ay___Ya Ya
.A.   C              G6   Fmaj7
 Oh,    no__ no no__   yea yea!__

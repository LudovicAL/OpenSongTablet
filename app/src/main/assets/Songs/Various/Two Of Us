.G                                            C    C/B    Am7
 Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's hard earned pay
.G                                       C  C/B Am       G
 You and me Sunday driving, not arriving on our way back home
.D                G     D                G     C           G
 We're on our way home, we're on our way home, we're going home

.G                                            C  C/B Am7
 Two of us sending postcards, writing letters on our wall
.G                                           C  C/B Am7      G
 You and me burning matches, lifting latches on our way back home
.D                G     D                G     C           G
 We're on our way home, we're on our way home, we're going home

;Bridge
.Dm             G7
 You and I have memories
.Am              Gm                  Am          D7
 Longer than the road that stretches out ahead   

.G                                            C  C/B Am7
 Two of us wearing raincoats, standing so low in the sun
.G                                         C  C/B Am7      G
 You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere on our way back home
.D                G     D                G     C           G
 We're on our way home, we're on our way home, we're going home

;Repeat bridge

.G                                            C  C/B Am7
 Two of us wearing raincoats, standing so low in the sun
.G                                         C  C/B Am7      G
 You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere on our way back home
.D                G     D                G     C           G
 We're on our way home, we're on our way home, we're going home

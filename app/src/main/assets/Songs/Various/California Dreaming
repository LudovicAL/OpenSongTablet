;The Mamas and the Papas
.                   Am   GF        G      Bm7  E7
 All the leaves are brown  and the sky is grey 
.F               C   E7 Am              EE7
 I've been for a walk  on a winter's day 

.                   Am  GF     G        Bm7E7
 I'd be be safe and warm  if I was in L.A. 
.           Am      GF   G               Bm7 E7
 California dreaming  on such a winter's day 

.               Am    GF          G        Bm7 E7
 Stopped into a church  I passes along the way 
.     F              C    E7 Am      F       E    E7
 Oh I got down on my knees  and I pretend to pray 
.                                Am    GF
 You know the preacher likes the cold,  
.         G         Bm7  E7
 he knows I'm gonna stay 
.           Am      GF  G               Bm7 E7
 California dreaming on such a winter's day 

.                   Am   GF        G      Bm7  E7
 All the leaves are brown  and the sky is grey 
.F               C   E7 Am              EE7
 I've been for a walk  on a winter's day 

.            Am      GF        G       Bm7 E7
 If I didn't tell her  I could leave today 
.           Am      GF
 California dreaming 
.   G               Am  GF
 on such a winter's day  
.   G               Am  GF
 on such a winter's day  
.   G               Fmaj7
 on such a winter's day</lyrics>

.D                    A       D
  I ain't never gonna let you down
.                    A     D
 All you gotta do is trust me
.                   A        Bm
 I would never make you some clown
.D                   A     D
  Baby why won't you trust me

.G               A     G                 D         A
  You give up so easily I don't know why you can't see
.D C G C  D           C  G C       D        C     G
  I'm  depending  on  you,  don't  let  me  down  
.C       D            C   A
  I'm  depending  on  you 

 Baby if you can't change the world
 Maybe you should just change yourself
 You used to be such a sweet young girl
 Why you wanna be someone else?

 You give up so easily
 I don't know why you can't see
 I'm depending on you
 Is it to late now
 I'm depending on you</lyrics>

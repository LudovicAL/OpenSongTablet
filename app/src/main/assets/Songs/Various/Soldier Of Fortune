;Key: Gm

;Intro: Gm / F / Eb

.        Gm
 I have often told you stories
.F
 about the way
.   Gm
 I lived the life of a drifter
.Dm
   waiting for the day
.          Gm
 When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
.      F
 Then maybe you would say
.Gm
 Come lay with me and love me
.Dm                       D C Bb
   And I would surely stay    

.Bb       C                Gm  G F Eb
   But I feel I'm growing older    
.          F                Bb
 And the songs that I have sung
. D            Gm
 Echo in the distance
.           F
 Like the sound
.      Bb              Eb EbD
 Of a windmill going round  
.Cm                Dm
 Guess I'll always be
.              Gm
 A soldier of fortune.

;Solo:  Gm / C / Gm / C /
;Gm / Bb / C / Gm

 Many times I've been a traveller
 I looked for something new
 In days of old when nights were cold
 I wandered without you
 But those days I thought my eyes
 Had seen you standing near
 Though blindness is confusing
 It shows that you're not here.

 Now I feel I'm going older
 And the songs that I have sung
 Echo in the distance
 Like the sound
 Of a windmill going round
 Guess I'll always be
 A soldier of fortune

.     Eb             F
 Yes, I can hear the sound
.       Bb           Eb   EbD
 of a windmill going round  
.   Cm               Dm
 I guess I'll always be
.              Gm
 a soldier of fortune.
.   Eb         F
 I guess I'll always be
.              G
 a soldier of foRtune.</lyrics>

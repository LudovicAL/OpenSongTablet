.A   A   A   A
             
. A                 Bm    Bm
 I lit a thin green candle
.D           D           AA
 to make you jealous of me
.        A                A          Bm     Bm
 but the room just filled up with mosquitoes
.      D            D          E  E
 they heard that my body was free.
.      F#m        F#m      C#m            C#m
 Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night
.      D         D            A  A
 and I put it in your little shoe
.     Bm       Bm          G            G
 and then I confess that I tortured the dress
.          Bm           A             G      G
 that you wore for the world to look through.

.A   A   A   A
             
. A                        Bm   Bm
 I showed my heart to the doctor
.D           D            A   A
 he said I'd just have to quit
.      A          A         Bm        Bm
 then he wrote himself a perscription 
.    D            D              E E
 and your name was mentioned in it.
.     F#m       F#m          C#m     C#m
 Then he locked himself in a library shelf
.         D       D           A   A
 with the details of our honeymoon
.      Bm            Bm
 and I hear from the nurse
.          G           G
 that he's gotten much worse
.        Bm          A        G    G
 and his practice is all in a ruin.

.A   A   A   A
             
. A                         Bm      Bm
 I heard of a saint who had loved you
.     D           D            A     A
 So I studied all night in his school
.   A          A            Bm        Bm
 he taught that the duty of lovers    
.      D       D          E    E
 is to tarnish the golden rule.
.         F#m         F#m   C#m C#m
 And just when I was sure   
.         C#m            C#m
 that his teachings were pure
.    Bm        Bm          A     A
 he drowned himself in the pool  
.    Bm           Bm       G           G
 his body is gone but back here on the lawn
.    Bm        A         G     G
 his spirit continues to drool.

.A   A   A   A
             
. A                    Bm     Bm
 An Eskimo showed me a movie  
.D           D          A  A
 he'd recently taken of you
.    A          A               Bm        Bm
 the poor man could hardly stop shivering,
.    D            D              E  E
 his lips and his fingers were blue.
.      F#m       F#m
 I suppose that he froze
.         C#m            C#m
 when the wind took your clothes
.      D             D         A
 and I guess he just never got warm
.        Bm             Bm           G           G
 but you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice
.          Bm          A         G    G
 o, please let me come into the storm.</lyrics>

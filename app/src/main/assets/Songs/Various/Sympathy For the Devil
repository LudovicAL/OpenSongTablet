.E                        D                   A                  E
 Please allow me to introduce myself,  I'm a man of wealth and taste
.E                       D                    A                           E
 I've been around for long,long years  I've stolen many a man's soul and faith
.E                    D                   A                     E
 I was around when Jesus Christ  had His moments of doubt and pain
.E                      D                  A                    E
 I made damn sure that Pilate  washed his hands and sealed his fate

.B                      B                 E
 Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
.B                               B                 E
 but what's puzzling you, is the     nature of my game
[

 I stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was time for a change
 I killed the Czar and his ministers, Anastasia screamed in vain
 I rode a tank, held a gen'ral's rank, when the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

;Chorus

 I watched with glee while your kings and queens, fought for ten decades for
 the gods they made
 I shouted out "Who killed the Kennedys?", when after all it was you and me
 So let me please introduce myself, I am a man of wealth and taste
 And I lay traps for troubadours, who get killed before they reach Bombay

;Chorus

 Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,
 but what's confusing you, is just the nature of my game

 Just as every cop is criminal, and all the sinners, Saints
 As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer, 'cause I'm in need of some restraint
 So if you meet me, have some courtesy, have some sympathy and some taste
 Use all your well-learned politesse, or I'll lay your soul to waste

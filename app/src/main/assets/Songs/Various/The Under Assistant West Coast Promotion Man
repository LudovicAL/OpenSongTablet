.         G
 Well Im waiting at the bus stop in down town LA
.         C7                                   A
 Well Im waiting at the bus stop in down town LA
.               D7                  C7           G
 Well, I'd much rather be on a bird walk on Broadway
.           G
 Well Im sitting here thinking just how sharp I am
.           C7                                  G
 Well Im sitting here thinking just how sharp I am
.        D7                  C7                G
 Im an Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man

 Well, promo groups when they come into town
 Well, promo groups when they come into town
 Well, they laugh at my toupe they sure put me down

 Well Im sitting here thinking just how sharp I am
 Well Im sitting here thinking just how sharp I am
 Im a necessary talent behind ev'ry rock 'n' roll band</lyrics>

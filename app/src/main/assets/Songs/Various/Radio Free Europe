.A                             D   E
 Decide yourself if radio's gonna stay
.A                          D   E
 Reason it could polish up the gray
.A                             D     E
 Put that put that put that up your wall
.A                       D   E
 That this isn't country at all

.F#    A      E E A E   F#    A         B
 Radio station         decide yourself  

 Keep me out of country in the word
 Deal of fortunes leading us absurd
 Push that push that push that to the floor
 That this isn't nothing at all

 Straight off the boat where to go

.E           A              E           A
 Calling out in the transit calling out in the transit
.E     A                E       A
 Radio Free Europe              

 Decide defy the media too fast
 Instead of pushing palaces to fall
 Put that put that put that up your wall
 That this isn't fortunate at all

 Radio station decide yourself
 Calling out in the transit calling out in the transit
 Radio Free Europe

.Bsus4   C#                  Bsus4            C#
 Decide yourself coming on a boat  I am not a bum!

 Keep me out of country in the word
 Disappointment into us absured

 Straight up above where to go
 Calling out in the transit calling out in the transit
 Radio Free Europe</lyrics>

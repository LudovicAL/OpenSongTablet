.D                 A
 What there was left of us
.                                      D
 Was all covered in dust and thick skin
.     A
 A half eaten apple

 Or the whole Sistine Chapel
.                            D
 Painted on the head of a pin
.    G
 A life long love's worth

 Gone up in a smurk
.                                    D
 And you didn't even see her waltz in
.             G
 Now this love is a ghost

 Having played host
.                          D
 To the most unoriginal sin

.           A
 At the wedding we smiled
.                                   D
 While some devil played wild violin
.A
 Soon after the chapel

 She offered me that apple
.                                     D
 One bite and I was gone with the wind
.               G
 And you needed no proof

 Cause the whole naked truth
.                                  D
 Was wearing only an infidel's grin
.            A
 And a proud schoolboy's boast

 Of having left his post
.                           D
 For the most unoriginal sin

 INSTRUMENTAL  D/G/D/A/D x2

.               A
 Now the jukebox is humming
.                                  D
 All the venial shortcomings of men
.          A
 Lord I found me this drink

 That can finally sink
.                                          D
 All the skills that I've been wallowing in
.            G
 Buddy once you get started

 Once true love's departed
.                             D
 You do it over and over again
.         A
 So tonight I will toast

 Just whoever comes close
.                           D
 To the most unoriginal sin.</lyrics>

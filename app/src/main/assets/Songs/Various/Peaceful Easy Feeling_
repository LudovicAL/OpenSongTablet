.E           A                   E       A
 I like the way your sparkling earrings lay,
. E            A       B7
 Against your skin so brown.
.  E         A                    E        A
 I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight,
. E              A          B7
 With a million stars all around.

;Chorus:
.                      A               E
 (Because) I've got a peaceful, easy feeling,
.  A                     F#m  B7
 I know you won't let me down,
.        E    F#m       A     B7      E
 Because I'm already standing on the ground.

 I found out a long time ago,
 What a woman can do to your soul.
 Ah, but she can't take you anywhere,
 You don't already know how to go.

;Chorus.

 I get this feeling I may know you,
 As a lover or a friend.
 This voice keeps whispering in my ear,
 I may never see you again.

;Chorus.

 Yes, I'm already standing,
 Yes, I'm already standing,
 Yes, I'm already standing on the ground.

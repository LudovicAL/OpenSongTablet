.         Bb A
 Hit it...  This ain't no disco
.Bb              A
 and it ain't no country club
.Bb A
  this L.A.

.E
 "All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die" says the
.C              D
 man next to me out of nowhere
.E
 Apropos of nothing, he says his name's William but I'm sure he's
.C             D
 Billy, Mac or Buddy
.     E
 he's plain ugly to me, and I
.C                         D
 wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his life
.E
 We are drinking beer at noon on a Tuesday
.C                           D
 in a bar that faces a giant car wash
.E
 The good people of the world are washing their cars
.C                     D
 on their lunch break, as best as they can in skirts and suits

.Bb A
  They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
.Bb A
  back to the phone company and the record store
.Bb A
  Well they're nothing like Bily and me,

[C]
.                  E
 cause all I wanna do is have some fun,
.           C                        D
 I've got a feeling that I'm not the only one,
.            E
 all I wanna do is have some fun,
.           C                        D
 I've got a feeling that I'm not the only one
.            E
 all I wanna do is have some fun,
.          C                 D                  E
 until the sun comes up over  Santa Monica boulevard
.CD

.E
 I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
.C                                           D
 and Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottle of Bud
.E
 and shred them on the bar, then he lights every match in an oversized pack
.C                D
 letting each one burn down to his
.E
 thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
.CD
 

.Bb A
  and he's watching the Buds as they spin on the floor,
.Bb A
  a happy couple enters the bar dangerously close,
.Bb A
  the bartender looks up from his want ads

;Chorus

.Bb A
  otherwise the bar is ours
.Bb A
  the day and thee night and the car wash too
.Bb A
  the matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
.Bb A
  the sun and the moon

;Chorus

;continue chorus, sometimes replace -Ive got a feeling Im not the only one-
;with -I want to tell you the party has just begun-
;then fade-slowdown on the E-C-D pattern, and end on Bb A</lyrics>

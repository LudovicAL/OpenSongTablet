.  G
 I hear the train a-comin'; it's rollin' 'round the bend,
.  G                                              G7
 And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
.    C7                                             G
 I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on.
.         D7                                     G
 But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone.

 2. When I was just a baby, my momma told me, "Son,
 Always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns."
 But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.
 When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry.

 3. I bet there's rich folk eatin'in a fancy dining car.
 They're prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars,
 But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free,
 But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me.

 4. Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine,
 I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line,
 Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay,
 And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.</lyrics>

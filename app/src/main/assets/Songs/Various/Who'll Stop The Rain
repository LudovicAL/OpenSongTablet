;Intro
.G         Em          G          Em
                                  
.G                       C                G
 Long as I remember, the rain been coming down
.G                             C             G
 Clouds of mystery pourin', confusion on the ground
.C                    G     C                  G
 Good men through the ages, trying to find the sun
.C             D               Em              G
 And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain

.G                          C                  G
 Heard the singers playing, how we cheered for more
.G                              C              G
 The crowd had rushed together, tryin' to keep warm
.C                   G        C             G
 Still the rain kept pourin', falling on my ears
.C             D               Em              G
 And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain

.G                             C                G
 I went down Virginia, seeking shelter from the storm
.G                         C                 G
 Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow
.C                   G          C                 G
 Five year plans and new deals, wrapped in golden chains
.C             D               Em              G
 And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain</lyrics>

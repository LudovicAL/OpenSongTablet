;Del Shannon/M. Crook

.Am                G
 As I walk along I wonder what went wrong
.     F                            E
 With our love, a love that was so strong
.Am                       G
 And as I still walk on I think of the things we've done
.         F                     E
 Together while our hearts were young

;Chorus

.A
 I'm a-walkin' in the rain
.F#m
 Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
.        A
 Wishin' you were here by me
.       F#m
 To end this misery
.      A                        F#m
 And I wonder     I wo-wo-wo-wo-wonder
.         A                               F#m
 Why              Why-why-why-why-why she ran away
.      D                     E
 And I wonder where she will stay
.          A        D                A        E
 My little runaway, run-run-run-run, runaway  

;Musitron solo, same chords as verse

;Chorus

.          A        D                A       D
 My little runaway, run-run-run-run, runaway

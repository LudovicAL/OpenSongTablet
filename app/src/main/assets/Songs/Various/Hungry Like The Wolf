.E
 Dark in the city, night is a wire, steam in the subway, the earth is a-fire
.      D                                  E
 Do-do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do
.E
 Woman you want me, give me a sign, and catch me breathing I'm even closer behind
.      D                                  E
 Do-do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do

.C                 G                  F
 In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
.               C                       G              F               D
 I smell like a sound, I'm lost and I'm found, and I'm hungry like the wolf
.             C                         G              F
 Straddle the line, it's discord and rhyme, I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
.          C                   G            F               D    Em7sus
 Mouth is alive, all running inside and I'm hungry like the wolf 

.E
 Stalked in the forest too close to hide, I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
.      D                                  E
 Do-do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do
.E
 High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight, you feel my heat I'm just a moment behind
.      D                                  E
 Do-do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do

.C                 G                  F
 In touch with the ground, I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
.               C                       G              F               D
 I smell like a sound, I'm lost and I'm found, and I'm hungry like the wolf
.             C                         G                F
 Straddle the line, it's discord and rhyme, I howl and I whine, I'm after you
.          C                      G            F               D    Em7sus
 Mouth is alive, with juices like wine and I'm hungry like the wolf</lyrics>

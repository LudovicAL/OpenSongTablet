.C                                             Am
 I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
.       G
 I have squandered my resistance
.      Dm             G                 C
 For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
.             Am            G                 F
 All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
.                   C    GFFC
 And disregards the rest    

.       C                                                Am
 When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
.       G
 In the company of strangers
.       Dm         G                C
 In the quiet of a railway station, running scared
.       Am           G              F
 Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
.                        C
 Where the ragged people go
.        G              F    F          C
 Looking for the places only they would know

[C
.       Am          G                         Am
 Lie la lie, Lie la lie la lie la lie, Lie la lie,
.G                           F           C
 Lie la lie la la la la, lie la la la la lie.

.       C                                         Am
 Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job
.             G
 But I get no offers
.       Dm               G                 C
 Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
.       Am                G                F
 I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
.                    C
 I took some comfort there
.G                  FFC
 Lie lie lie lie la   

.         C                                              Am
 Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
.      G              Dm                    G      C           Am
 Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me 
.        G  F      C
 Leading me, going home.

.       C                                            Am
 In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
.       G                           G7
 And he carries a reminder of ev'ry glove that laid him down
.   C                                              Am
 Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
.     G             F
 I am leaving, I am leaving
.                        C
 But the fighter still remains

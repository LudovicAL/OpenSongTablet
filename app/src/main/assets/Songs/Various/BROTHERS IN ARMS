.G#mE   G#mE  C#m
              
.                     E      F#
 These mist covered mountains
.                 B Bsus4 B
 Are home now for me   
.        D#m         G#m     D#m
 But my home is the low lands
.                E F#sus4 F#
 And always will be   
.                G#m     D#m
 Someday you'll return to
.                      E   C#m7F#sus4
 Your valley and your farms    
.           F#        G#m
 And you'll no longer burn
.      E         F#sus4 F#
 To brothers in arms

.                D#m       E       F#
 Through these fields of destruction
.             B  Bsus4 B
 Baptisms of fire   
.      D#m               G#m    D#m
 I've watched all your suffering
.                      E    F#sus4 F#
 As the battles raged higher    
.                    G#m         D#m
 And though they did hurt me so bad
.                  E  C#m F#sus4
 In the fear and alarm    
.    F#       G#m
 You did not desert me
.      E        F#
 My brothers in arms

;G:
.G#mE   C#m E   G#m E   C#m C#m
                            
.G#m        F#              G#m  F#
 There's so many different worlds
.   B               E
 So many different suns
.    F#               G#m  F#
 And we have just one world
.        B             E      E
 But we live in different ones

;G:
.G#mE   C#m E   G#m E   C#m C#m
                            
.        D#m           E   F#
 Now the sun's gone to hell
.                       B  Bsus4 B
 And the moon's riding high   
.        D#m         G#m D#m
 Let me bid your farewell
.                 E
 Everyman has to die
.                         G#m    D#m
 But its written in the starlight
.                        E  C#m F#sus4
 ANd every line on your palm    
.        F#           G#m
 We're fools to make war
.        E           F#
 On our brothers in arms

 A       G       B    A     G      B     (keep repeating
 A G and B chords)

 Dusk is dawn is day, where did it go
 I've been laughing, fast and slow
 Moving in still-frame, howling at the moon
 Morning found me laughing, up and down, down, low, low, low
 Night suits me fine, morning suits me fine
 I've been so happy, happy, way up high, high
 In between, down below, low, low, low
 Low, low, low
.C             G          Em
 I skipped the part about love
.C             G          Em
 It seemed so silly to love

.A    G     B
 Low, low, low
 Low, low, low
 I said the morning, it isn't your time
 Barefoot and naked, I can see your lines
 It doesn't bother me, if you are white
 Your grass is grassly wet
 Your light, white is bright, light, white, light

.C                 G          Em
 I'll skip the the part about love
.C            G           Em
 It seems so shallow, to love

 Low, low, low
 Low, low, low

 You and me, we know about time
 We know how things go, they come and go and live and grow
 They pass and go and glow and glow, up and down, high and low, low, low, low
 Low, low, low

 I skipped the part about love
 It seemed so silly to love
 I skipped the part about love
 It seemed so shallow, love
 Low, low, low
 Low, low, low
 I like you hands, all full of glory, all full of glory</lyrics>

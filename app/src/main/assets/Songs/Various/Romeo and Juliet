.F  Dm
       x4

;Verse I:
.F                C Dm                         CF
 A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
.F                C Dm             C           Bb
 Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
.C                         Bb C            F
 Finds a street light steps out into the shade
.        Bb                           C
 Says something like you and me babe, how about it?
.F                          C Dm                        C F
 Juliet says hey it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack
.F                         C Dm                          C Bb
 He's underneath the window, she's singing hey la my boyfriends back
.C                           Bb  C                        F
 you shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that
. Bb                        C
 Anyway, what you gonna do about it?

;Chorus I:
.F      C             Dm C             Bb
 Juliet the dice was loaded from the start
.F      C             Dm C             Bb
 And I bet, and you exploded in my heart.
.F      C             Dm              Bb
 And I forget, I forget, the movie song
.Gm                                  F        Bb    C     Dm  C  F
 When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong  Juliet?

;Verse II:
 Come up on different streets, they both the streets of shame
 Both dirty both mean, yes and even and dream was just the same
 And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real.
 How can you look at me as if I was just another part of your deal

 Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold.
 you can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
 You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin yeah
 Now you just say oh Romeo yeah, I used to have a scene with him.

;Chorus II:
 Juliet when we made love you used to cry
 you said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die
 There's a place for us, you know the movie song
 When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?

;Verse III:
 I can't do the talk, like they talk on the tv
 I can't do a love song, like the way it's meant to be.
 I can't do anything, but I'd do anything for you.
 I cant't do anything but be in love with you.

 And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
 All I do is keep the beat and bad company.
 All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
 Juliet I'd do the stars with you anytime.

;Repeat Chorus II:

;Verse IV:
 A love struck Romeo, sings the streets a serenade.
 Now he's laying everymody low, with a love song that he made.
 Finds a convenient street light, steps out of the shade
 Says something like you and me babe how about it

;Outro:
 Bb C  (as long as the lead player can do those tasty fills)</lyrics>

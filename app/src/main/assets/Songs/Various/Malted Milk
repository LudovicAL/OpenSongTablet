.        E7                   A7                                E7
 I keep drinkin' malted milk, try'n to drive my blues away.     
.        A7                                                 E7
 I keep drinkin' malted milk, try'n to drive my blues away. 
.                  B7                           A7
 Baby, you're just welcome to my lovin' as the flowers is in May.
.E5        C#7/G#               C7/G                 B7
                                                     

 Malted milk, malted milk, keep rushin' to my head.
 Malted milk, malted milk, keep rushin' to my head.
 And I have a funny funny feeling and I'm talking all out of my head.

 Baby fix me one more drink, 'n hug your daddy one more time.
 Baby fix me one more drink, 'n hug your daddy one more time.
.                                                         E5
 Keep on stirrin' my malted milk mama, until I change my mind.
.C#7/G#             C7/G                    B7/F#

 My door knob keeps on turnin', there must be spooks around my bed.
 My door knob keeps on turnin', there must be spooks around my bed.
 And I have a funny funny feeling, and the hair is risin' on my head.</lyrics>

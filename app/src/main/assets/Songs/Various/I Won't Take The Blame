;Intro
.G#m       E          G#m        E        C#m
                                          
.B                   E                 B
 Daylight comes with such surprising speed
.B             E                  C#m             F#
 Yesterday you talked of love and now you want to leave
.B                 E                  B
 Dont expect me to stand in your way  
.B                 E         C#m              F#
 I am powerless to alter any action you might take

;Chorus
.B                      E
 But I won't take the blame
.B                                  E             C#m
 I was not thet one who played the joker in this game
.B                          E          F#
 I am not the one who feels nothing anymore
.          C#m           E            C#m
 So if you walk out that door I won't take the blame

.C#m       F#         E           C#m         F#          E           C#m
                                                                      
.B                  E                  B
 As I looked at the girl I once adored 
.B                  E                  C#m                 F#
 You tell me that I hold you back, you tell me that you're bored
.B                           E                B
 So like a pair of clowns we stand around and fight
.B                        E             C#m            F#
 But why don't you get it over with and walk out of my life

;Chorus

.G#m     C#m                    F#  B                          E
 And the steps of this stone church are peppered with confetti hearts
.     C#m              F#           C#m        F#      B
 like a million little love affairs waiting to fall apart

.        F          C7      F
 Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
.                Abdim  C7
 But the fire is so delightful,
.    Gm          D7          Gm
 And since we've no place to go,
.       C7                        F
 Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

 It doesn't show signs of stopping,
 And I brought some corn for popping;
 The lights are turned way down low,
 Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

.C                                C
 When we finally kiss good night, 
.         Dm7        G7         C
 How I'll hate going out in the storm;
.    C                            C
 But if you really hold me tight, 
.D7                       G7    C7
 All the way home I'll be warm. 

 The fire is slowly dying,
 And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing,
 But as long as you love me so.
 Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.</lyrics>

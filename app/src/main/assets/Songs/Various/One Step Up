.Bb6
   Woke up this morning the house was cold
.F2/A
   Checked the furnace she wasn't burnin'
.gm7
   Went out and hopped in my old Ford
.F2/A
   Hit the engine but she ain't turnin'
.Bb6
   We've given each other some hard lessons lately
.F2/A
   But we ain't learnin'
.     gm7           F2/A           Bb6
 We're the same sad story that's a fact
.         C4               Bb6  F2/A  gm7   F2/A
 One step up and two steps back __________________

.          Bb6
 Bird on a wire outside my motel room
.F2/A
   But he ain't singin'
.gm7
   Girl in white outside a church in June
.F2/A
   But the church bells they ain't ringing
.Bb6
   I'm sittin' here in this bar tonight
.F2/A
   But all I'm thinkin' is
.gm7                F2/A           Bb6
   I'm the same old story same old act
.         C4               Bb6  F2/A  gm7   F2/A
 One step up and two steps back __________________

.Bb6
   It's the same thing night on night
.F2/A
   Who's wrong baby who's right
.gm7
   Another fight and I slam the door on
.F2/A
   Another battle in our dirty little war
.Bb6
   When I look at myself I don't see
.F2/A
   The man I wanted to be
.gm7                   F2/A               Bb6
   Somewhere along the line I slipped off track
.                           C4               Bb6  F2/A  gm7   F2/A
 I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back __________________

.Bb6
   There's a girl across the bar
. F2/A
 I get the message she's sending
.gm7
   Mmm she ain't lookin' too married
.F2/A
   And me well honey I'm pretending
.Bb6
   Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms
.F2/A
   The music was never-ending
.   gm7                   F2/A         Bb6
 We danced as the evening sky faded to black
.         C4               Bb6  F2/A  gm7   F2/A
 One step up and two steps back __________________

;FADE OUT

.G                  F
 The lights are on, but you're not home
.C         G
 Your mind is not your own
.G                  F
 Your heart sweats, your body shakes
.C            G
 Another kiss is what it takes

.G                F
 You can't sleep, you can't eat
.C                  G
 There's no doubt - you're in deep
.G                     F
 Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
.C            G
 Another kiss is all you need
;Chorus:
.Em                            C
 You like to think that you're imune to the stuff
.G
 Oh yeah
.Em                              C
 It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
.                G
 You know you're gonna have to face it
 You're addicted to love

 You see the signs - but you can't read
 You're running at a different speed
 Your heart beats in double time
 nother kiss and you'll be mine
 A one-track mind; you can't be saved
 Oblivion is all you crave
 If there's some left over for you
 You don't mind if you do

;Chorus:

 Might as well face it: you're addicted to love
 (repeated many times over the
 same scheme as the refrains) (so G F C G)

;Solo:

 The light are on, but you're not home
 Your mind is not your own
 Your heart sweats your teeth grind
 Another kiss and you'll be mine

;Chorus:

 Might as well face it you're addicted to love (8x)</lyrics>

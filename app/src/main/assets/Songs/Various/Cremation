.  G          D              A     G
 Well the cold black sea, waits for me me me
.    G          D            A
 The cold black sea waits forever
.    G             D            A         G
 The waves hit the shore crying more more more
.    G          D            A
 The cold black sea waits forever

 The tornadoes come up the coast they run
 Hurricanes rip the sky forever
 Though the weather's changed the sea remains the same
 The cold black sea waits forever

 There are ashes spilt to collective guilt
 People rest at sea forever
 Since they burned you up, collect you in a cup
 For you the cold black sea has no terror

 Will your ashes float like some foreign boat
 Or will they sink absorbed forever
 Will the Atlantic coast have its final boast
 Nothing else contained you ever

 Now the cold black sea waits for me me me
 The cold black sea waits forever
 When I leave this joint, at some further point
 The same cold black sea will it be waiting?</lyrics>

.Bm                 F#7      D                   E  G
 Standing at the crossroads try'n' to read the signs to tell me
.A                  Bm              F#7        D              E
 which way I should go to find the answer and all the time I know,
.G            A              B
 plant your love and let it grow.

;CHORUS
[C
.   B                         E     B               A
 |	Let it grow, let it grow, let it blossom let it flow
.B                                E       B    A        F#7
 In the sun, the rain, the snow, love is lovely  let it grow
[

 Looking for a reason to check out an my mind, trying hard to get
 a friend that I can count on, but there's nothing left to show,
 plant your love and let it grow.

;CHORUS

 Time is getting shorter, there's much for you to do,
 only ask and you will get what you are needing, the rest is up to you,
 plant your love and let it grow.

;CHORUS

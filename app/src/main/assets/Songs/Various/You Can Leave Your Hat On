 Baby, take off your coat, real slow
 Take off your shoes, I'll take off your shoes
 Take off your dress, yes - yes - yes

.        C                E
 You can leave your hat on
.        F                Bb
 You can leave your hat on
 You can leave your hat on

.C
 Go over there, turn on the lights, all the lights
 Come back you, stand on that chair, yeah, woman, that's right
 Raise your arms in the air, and I shake 'em

.C                     E
 You give me reason to live
.                      F
 You give me reason to live
.                      Bb
 You give me reason to live
 You give me reason to live

 Sweet darlin'                   (You can leave your hat on)

.C
 Suspicious minds keep talking
 They're trying to tear us apart
 They don't believe in this love of mine
 They don't know what love is

 They don't know what love is
 They don't know what love is
 They don't know what love is
 I know what love is

.              Bb        F                                   C
 Love's on the way, ooooh                (You can leave your hat on)
.                Bb            F                             C
 Yes, leave your hat on, sweet woman     (You can leave your hat on)
.                Bb         F                                C
 Yes, leave your hat on                  (You can leave your hat on) +sax
.                    Bb    F                                 C
 Do that to me, yeah                     (You can leave your hat on)</lyrics>

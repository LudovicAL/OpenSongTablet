 Repeat main riff twice for each line of the verses:
.D D C C G/B G/B Bb C
               

 In the white room with black curtains near the station.
 Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.
 Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes.
 Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment.

.     C             G                Bb         A
 I'll  wait in this  place where the  sun never  shines;
.C             G                Bb       C         D
  Wait in this  place where the  shadows  run from  themselves.

 You said no strings could secure you at the station.
 Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
 I walked into such a sad time at the station.
 As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

.     C            G               Bb           A
 I'll  wait in the  queue when the  trains come  back;
.C         G              Bb       C         D
  Lie with  you where the  shadows  run from  themselves.

.GmF DmC
       
.GmF DmC Am7
         

 At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
 Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.
 Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.
 She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.

.     C              G               Bb      A
 I'll  sleep in this  place with the  lonely  crowd;
.C           G               Bb       C         D
  Lie in the  dark where the  shadows  run from  themselves.

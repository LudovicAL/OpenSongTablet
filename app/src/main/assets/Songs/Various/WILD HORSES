;ROLLING STONES

.G AmG AmG
         
.Bm          G      Bm           G
   Childhood living   is easy to do
.Am               C       D   G                  D    C
   the things you want to      I bought them for you  
.Bm          G      Bm               G
   priceless lady     you know who I am
.Am           C         D       G                D      C
   You know I can't let you     slide through my hands  

.Am     C      D  G         F       C
   Wild Horses     couldn't drag me away
.Am          C      D  G         F        C
   wild wild horses     couldn't drag me away

.Bm              G      Bm              G
   I watched you suffer   a dull aching pain
.Am          C     D  G               D     C
   now you decided     to show me the same  
.Bm               G      Bm            G
   no sweet thing exits    oh of stage blinds
.Am                 C      D     G          D       C
   could make me be bitter     or treat you unkind  

.Am     C      D  G         F       C
   Wild Horses     couldn't drag me away
.Am          C      D  G         F        C
   wild wild horses     couldn't drag me away

.Bm            G           Bm                 G
   I know I've drained you   it seemed like a lie
.Am          C       D  G                       D     C
   I have my freedom      but I don't have much time  
.Bm               G      Bm              G
   faith has been broken   tears must be cried
.Am             C      D  G            D     C
   lets do some living     after we've died  

.Am     C      D  G         F        C
   wild horses     couldn't drag me away
.Am          C      D  G      F              C
   wild wild horses     we'll ride them some day

.Am     C      D  G         F        C
   wild horses     couldn't drag me away
.Am          C      D  G      F              C
   wild wild horses     we'll ride them some day</lyrics>

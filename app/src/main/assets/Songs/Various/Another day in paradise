.    Em                   D  Am7 Em
 She calls out to the man on the street
.             D
 "Sir can you help me?
.     Em              D        Am7
 It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
.   Em                           D
 Is there somewhere you can tell me? "

[V2]
 He walks on doesn't look back
 He pretends he can't hear her
 Start to whisle as he crosses
 the stree., seem embarrassed to be there

[C]
.    Em    D                Cmaj7/E
 Oh, think twice, cos' it's another
.                          D
 day for you and me in paradise
.    Em    D                Cmaj7/E
 Oh, think twice, cos' it's another
.             D       Em    D C       Em
 day for you, you and me in paradise  

;Instrumental fill
.   Em            D               G
 Oh lord is there nothing more anybody
.           D/F# Em
 can do. Oh lord there must be
.     D            G     D  Am7
 something you can say      
.          Em              D
 It's just another day for you
.    Am7       Em
 and me in paradise

[V3]
 She calls out to the man on the street
 Ha can see she's been crying
 She's get blisters on he soles of her feet
 she can't walk but she's trying

[V4]
 You can tell from the lines on her face
 You can see that she's been there
 Probably been moved on from every place
 cos' she didn't fit in there</lyrics>

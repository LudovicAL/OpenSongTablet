.                     D
 INTRO (strike once): 

;VERSE 1:
.            D
 Working all day
.                  G
 And the sun don't shine
.              A
 Trying to get by
.                     D
 And I'm just killin' time
.           D
 I feel the rain
.                     G
 Fall the whole night through
.              Em A
 Far away from you
.           D
 California Blue

;CHORUS:
.           G
 California Blue
.              D
 Dreaming all alone
.                A7
 Nothing else to do
.           D
 California Blue
.           G
 Everyday I pray
.              D
 I'll be on my way
.                A7
 Saving love for you
.           D
 California Blue

;BRIDGE:
.A7
 One Sunny Day
.         D
 I'll get back again
.G            A
 Somehow, someway
.      D
 But I don't know when
.           A
 California Blue
.           D
 California Blue

;VERSE 2:
.          D
 Living my life
.               G
 With you on my mind
.            A
 Thinking of things
.                  D
 That I left far behind
.             D
 It's been so long
.                G
 Doing all I can do
.               Em A
 To get back to you
.           D
 California Blue

;REPEAT CHORUS &amp; BRIDGE: ---)

;OUTTRO (Repeat 3 times):
.              Em A
 Still missing you
.           D

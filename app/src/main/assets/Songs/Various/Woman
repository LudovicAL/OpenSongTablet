.C     Dm7       C             Dm7
 Woman,    I can hardly express
.          Am            Dm             G
 my mixed emotions at my thoughtlessness.
.F         Dm7     Em           Gsus4
  After all I'm forever in your debt.
.    C      Dm7    C
 And woman, I will try to express
.Dm C      Am           Dm        G
  my inner feelings and thankfulness
.F           Dm7    Em             Gsus4
 for showing me the meaning of success.
.Cmaj7    Am7     Dm7               G6
        Oooh well-well, Doo doo doo doo doo.
.Cmaj7    Am      Dm7               G6
        Oooh well-well, Doo doo doo doo doo

 Woman, I know you understand
 the little child inside the man.
 Please remember, my life is in your hands.
 And woman, hold me close to your heart.
 However distant, don't keep us apart.
 After all it is written in the stars.
 Ooh well-well, Doo doo doo doo doo.
 Ooh well-well, Doo doo doo doo doo.

.C    Dm7        C           Dm7
 Woman  , please let me explain.
.C       Am                 Dm          G
 I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain.
.F         Dm7       Em                   Gsus4  G
 So let me tell you again and again and agaaaahiaaiin.</lyrics>

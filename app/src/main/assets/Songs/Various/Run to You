;I read in an interview with B.A's guitar tech that he uses a guitar which
;is tuned to D (I think) to play this. i.e the chords below are OK but may
;not sound exactly like the record
;Intro:
.Em7  G  A    Em7  G  A    Em7  G  A    Em7  G  D
                                                
.Em           G        A        Em       G  D
 She says her love for me could never die   
.Em                           G          A         Em      G  D
 but that would change if she ever found out about you and I  
.Em          G       D
 Oh -but her love is cold
.Em                          G      D             C
 It wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, cause....
.        C           D
 When it gets to much
.          Bm7
 I need to feel your touch

;Chorus
.          Em         G    D  A
 I'm gonna run to you         
.          Em         G    D  A
 I'm gonna run to you         
.                Em        G               D       A
 'cause when the feeling's right I'm gonna run all night
.          Em         G    D
 I'm gonna run to you      

;Repeat intro

 Shes got a heart of gold she'd never let me down
 but you're the one that always turns me on  you keep me comin' round
 I know her love is true
 but it's so damn easy making love to you
 I got my mind made up
 I need to feel your touch

;Chorus

.           Em         G    D  A
 Yeah gonna run to you         
.            Em        G               D       A
 Oh when the feeling's right I'm gonna run all night
.          Em         G    D
 I'm gonna run to you      

;Break:
.E       D/F#    C       D       E       D/F#    C       Bm7
                                                         
.Em   G  D    Em   G  D
                      

;Repeat chorus till fade</lyrics>

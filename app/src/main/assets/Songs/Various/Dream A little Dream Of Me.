;Mamas and the Papas

.F      E7             Db7  C7
 Stars shining right above you
.F       Am             D7
 Night-breezes seem to whisper: I love you
.Gm                     Bbm
 Birds singing in the sycamore-trees
. F              Db7
 Dream a little dream of me.

 Say night-y-night and kiss me
 Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
 While I'm alone as blue as can be
. F               Db7 C7   F   A7
 Dream a little dream of me.   

;Chorus
[C]
.D     Bm         G        A
 Stars fading but I linger on dear
.D      Bm          G
 Still craving your kiss
.D    Bm         G             A
 I'm longing to linger till dawn dear
.D              Db7    C7
 Just saying this      
[]

 Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
 Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
 But in your dreams whatever they be
. F               Db7 C7   F   A7
 Dream a little dream of me.

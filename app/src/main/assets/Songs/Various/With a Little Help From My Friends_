.  C                         Dm
 What would you do if I sang out of tune,
.                G7          G7
 would you stand up and walk out on me?
.  C                            Dm
 Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
.             G7          G7        C
 and I'll try not to sing out of key.

;Chorus

 Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends.
.              Bb                  F              C
 Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
.                 Bb                  F               C
 Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.
.           Am7   D7        C        Bb
 Do you need anybody? - I need somebody to love.
.F          Am7   D7      C          Bb         F
 Could it be anybody? - I want somebody to love.
[

 What do I do when my love is away,
 does it worry you to be alone?
 How do I feel by the end of the day,
 are you sad because you're on your own?

;Chorus

 Would you believe in a love at first sight?
 Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.
 What do you see when you turn out the light?
 I can't tell you but I know it's mine.

.A
 I think I'm gonna be sad -
 I think it's today yeah
 the girl that's driving me mad
.         Bm   E7
 is going away 

.F#m                   D7
 She's got a ticket to ride
.F#m                   Gmaj7  G6     G6#11
 she's got a ticket to    ri-   hi-  hide
.F#m                   E7                   A
 she's got a ticket to ride - but she don't care

 She said that living with me
 is bringing her down yeah
 for she would never be free
 when I was around

;chorus

.  D7
 I don't know why she's riding so high
 she oughta think twice
.                       E7
 she oughta do right by me
.D7
 Before she gets to saying goodbye
 she oughta think twice
.                       E7
 she oughta do right by me

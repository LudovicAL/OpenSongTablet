.Em D
 Who will love a little sparrow,
.                C                  D
 Who's travelled far, and cries for rest?
.     Em           A
 "Not I," said the oak tree.
.   D                            A
 "I won't share my branches with no sparrow's nest;
.       D                        A             Em
 And my blanket of leaves won't warm her cold breast."

 Who will love a little sparrow,
 And who will speak a kindly word?
 "Not I," said the swan.
 "The entire idea is utterly absurd;
 I'd be laughed at and scorned if the other swans heard."

 And who will take pity in his heart,
 And who will feed a starving sparrow?
 "Not I," said the golden wheat.
 "I would if I could but I cannot I know;
 For I need all my grain to prosper and grow."

 Who will love a little sparrow,
 Will no one write her eulogy?
 "I will," said the Earth.
 "For all I've created returns unto me;
 From dust were ye made and dust ye shall be."

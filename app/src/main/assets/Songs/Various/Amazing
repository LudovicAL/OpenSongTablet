;Aerosmith
.       Am G  Am G
[Intro]  -  -  - 

.                 Am                   G
 I kept the right ones out and let the wrong ones in
.          C                                       F
 Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
.           Fm/G#                       C/G
 There were times in my life when I was goin' insane
.D/F#                           F
 Tryin' to walk through the pain
.          Am              Em/A
 When I lost my grip and I hit the floor
.           C                                              F
 Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
.      Fm/G#                C/G
 I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
.      D/F#                    F
 I was wishin' that I would die

;Chorus:
.      C     Em         F                      Em              G
 It's amazing, with the blink of an eye you finally see the light
.      C     Em          F                     Em                  G
 It's amazing when the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
.      F     Em       D                          G                  C
 It's amazing and I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

.     Am                          D
 That one last shot's a permanent vacation
.    F                                      C
 And how high can you fly with broken wings?
.Am                        D
 Life's a journey not a destination
.      F                                  G
 And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

.            Am                        G
 You have to learn to crawl before you learn to walk
.         C                                          F
 But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk
.            Fm/G#                   C/G
 Well, I was out on the street, just tryin' to survive
.D/F#                 F
 Scratchin' to stay alive

;Chorus

.D
   Desperate hearts, desperate hearts
.Em
   Did you wanna see without and give it out now (or whatever...)
.F
  Ow, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, ya ka kow, ya ka ka ka kow

;Outro:
.C   D   Em   F     G   Am   G   F
                                 
.C   D   Em   F     G   Am   G   F
                                 

;Following is spoken with a 30's newsreel sound
 So from all of us in Aerosmith to all of you out there wherever you are
 Remember, the light at the end of the tunnel may be you. Good night.</lyrics>

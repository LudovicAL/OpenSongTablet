.D            C    D
 It's getting near dawn
.     D            C     D
 when lights close their tired eyes
.     D       C    D
 I'll soon be with you my love
.   D        C  D
 to give you my dawn surprise
.     G       F   G
 I'll be with you darling soon
.     G       F   G                            D    C    D
 I'll be with you when the stars start falling           
.A         C       G
 I've been waiting so long
.A     C         G
 To be where I'm going
.A      C                G
 In the sunshine of your love

 I'm with you my love
 The light shining through on you
 Yes, I'm with you my love
 It's the morning and just we two
 I'll stay with you darling now
 I'll stay with you till my seeds are dried up
 I've been waiting so long
 To be where I'm going
 In the sunshine of your love</lyrics>

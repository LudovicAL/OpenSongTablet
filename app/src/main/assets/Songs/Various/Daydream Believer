.             G               Am
 Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
.        Bm              C
 Of the bluebird as it sings
.     G           Em                A7 D7
 The six-o-clock alarm would never ring
.        G           Am
 But it rings and I rise
.          Bm               C
 Wash the sleep out of my eyes
.     G      Em      C   D7        G
 My shaving razor's cold and it stings

.  C        D     Bm
 Cheer up sleepy Jean
.C        D      Em  C
 Oh what can it mean to a
. G          C           G      Em       A7 D7
 Daydream believer and a    homecoming queen

 You once thought of me
 As a white knight on a steed
 Now you know how happy
 Life can be
 And our good times start and end
 Without dollar one to spend
 But how much baby do we really need</lyrics>

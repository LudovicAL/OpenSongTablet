.        D    Bm      G    A7
 She was only sixteen only sixteen
. GA7        D
 I loved her so
.    D           Bm       G           A
 But she was too young to fall in love
.    G         A7    D
 and I was too young to know

.     D              Bm       G        A7
 We'd laugh and we'd sing and do funny things
.G      A7            D
 And it made our hearts glow
.    D           Bm       G           A
 But she was too young to fall in love
.    G         A7    D
 and I was too young to know

.Em      A7        D        Bm
 Why did I give my heart so fast
.Em       A7           D
 It never will happen again
.    Em      A7   D        Bm
 But I was a mere child of sixteen
.E           E7      A  A7
 I've aged a year since then

.        D    Bm      G    A7
 She was only sixteen only sixteen
.G         A7         D
 With eyes that would glow
.    D           Bm       G           A
 But she was too young to fall in love
.    G         A7    D
 and I was too young to know</lyrics>

.A           D                            A/C#
 Well, Billy rapped all night about his suicide
.         Bm                              D/A
 How he'd kick it in the head when he was twenty five,
.F#m                               A
 speed ive, don't wanna stay alive when your twenty five.
.    D                             A/C#
 And Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars, and
.Bm                      D                              F#m
 Freddies got spots from rippin' off the stars from his face
.              A
 (funky little boat race)
.    Em                                  F#7                Bm
 The television man is crazy saying were juvenile deliquent wrecks
.   G             D          Asus4   A
 Oh man I need TV when I got T.Rex - 
.        A
 Oh brother you guessed, I'm a dude dad.

[C]
.D  A/C#                Bm7
 Ah all the young dudes 
.D/A               Am

.G                  F
 boogaloo dudes     
.C/E                Bm C A/C# D
 carry the news        
.A/C#               Bm7

.G                  F
 boogaloo dudes

 Lucy looking sweet 'cos he dresses like a queen,
 but he can kick like mule it's a real mean team,
 but we can love - oh yes we can love.
 And my brothers back at home with his Beatles and his Stones,
 we never got it off on all that revolution stuff
 what a drag, - too many snags.
 Now I drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine -
 got to race some cat to bed - oh is there concrete all around
 or is it it my head - Yeah I'm a dude dad.

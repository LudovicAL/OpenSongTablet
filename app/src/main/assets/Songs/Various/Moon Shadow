.    D                       A7   D
 Oh, I'm bein' followed by a moon shadow,
.G            A7   D
 moon shadow, moon shadow,
.D                       A7   D
 Leapin and hoppin' on a moon shadow,
.G            A7   D
 moon shadow, moon shadow.

.    G    D    G       D      G       D       Em      A7
 And if I ever lose my hands, lose my plough, lose my land,
.   G    D    G       D         Em   A7   D   F#m   Hm
 Oh if I ever lose my hands, oh if                  
.  Em            A       D
 I won't have to work no more.

.    G    D    G       D     G       D        Em      A7
 And if I ever lose my eyes, lose my colours, all run dry,
.    G    D    G       D        Em   A7   D   F#m   Hm
 Yes if I ever lose my eyes, oh if                  
.  Em            A      D
 I won't have to cry no more.

.E7                  A         E                    A
 Did it take long to find me?  I asked the faithful light.
.E                   A         E7                         A
 Did it take long to find me?  And are you gonna stay the night?

.    G    D    G       D       G     D          Em    A7
 And if I ever lose my legs, I won't moan and I won't beg,

 Oh if I ever lose my legs, oh if

 I won't have to walk no more.

.    G    D    G       D      G      D      Em        A7
 And if I ever lose my mouth, all my teeth, north and south,

 Yes if I ever lose my mouth, oh if

 I won't have to talk.

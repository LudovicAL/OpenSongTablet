;Europe
.Em                       G
 Days filled with joy and days filled with sorrow
.Am                D
 I don't know just what to do
.     Em               G
 Am I happy today am I lonely tomorrow
.Am           D
 Everything depends on you

[C
.          C      Am         G         F#m         Em    D
 I've been waiting - for the angels to knock on my door  
.          C    Am           G                     D
 I've been hopin - that everything could be like before

.Am Hm C D

.Em                 G
 Open you heart and tell me what's wrong
.Am                          D
 Why can't you talk like you used to do before
.        Em                 G
 I don't know if I'm weak I don't know if I'm strong
.Am               D
 Hey girl I can't cope any more

[C
.          C      Am         G         F#m         Em    D
 I've been waiting - for the angels to knock on my door  
.          C    Am           G                     D
 I've been hopin - that everything could be like before

;Chorus
.Am Hm C D

.Em        Hm C    G      D
 Open your heart - let me hear you
.Em         HmC    Am  Hm      C        D
 Make up your mind - I want to hear you call
.Em        Hm C    G            D
 Open your heart - want to come near you
.Em         Hm  C   Am  Hm      C     D
 Make up your mind - oh girl before I call
;2 times

.Em                     G
 Maybe the sun will continue to shine
.Am                     D
 Maybe the rain will continue to fall
.Em                G
 Maybe you want to leave me behind
.Am                      D
 Maybe you'll change and give me a call

[C
.          C      Am         G         F#m         Em    D
 I've been waiting - for the angels to knock on my door  
.          C    Am           G                     D
 I've been hopin - that everything could be like before

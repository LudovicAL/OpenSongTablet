.                   Emmaj9                     Em6add9
 If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
.                 Em7add9          Em6add9
 And you hugh yourself on the cold cold ground
.              Am7                     Bm7
 You wake the morning in a stranger's coat
.                 Em  Emadd9 Em
 No one would you see   

.            Am7                   Bm7
 You ask yourself, who'd watch for me
.         Em                  Em/C#
 My only friend, who could it be
.             C
 It's hard to say it
.          B7                        Emmaj7 Em6
 I hate to say it, but it's probably me 

 When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
 And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
 You search the city for your only friend
 No one would you see

 You ask yourself, who could it be
 A solitary voice to speak out and set you free
 I hate to say it
 I hate to say it, but it's probably me

.       Am7                      D
 You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
.         Gadd9                        G       Am7  EmD Am7
 And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show     
.                  Bm7
 Some would say I should let you go your way
.            Gadd9   G
 You'll only make me cry

.               Am7    Bm7    Gmaj9
 If there's one guy, just one guy
.      Em                            Em/C#
 Who'd lay down his life for you and die
.              C
 It's hard to say it
.             B7                        Emmaj7 Em6 Emmaj7 Em6
 It's hard to say it, but it's probably me       

 When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
 There's only one voice that comes to your defense
 The jury's out and your eyes search the room
 And one friendly face is all you need to see

.               Am7    Bm7    Gmaj9
 If there's one guy, just one guy
.      Em                            Em/C#
 Who'd lay down his life for you and die
.              C
 It's hard to say it
.           B7                       Am7 A7
 I hate to say it, but it's probably me  
.           C
 I hate to say it
.           B7                       Am7 A7
 I hate to say it, but it's probably me

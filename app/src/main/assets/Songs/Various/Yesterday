. C         E      E7                 Am       G   F
 Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,    
.        G7                      C
 Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
.G   Am    D7     F     C
 Oh, I believe in yesterday.

.C         E       E7             Am         G   F
 Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be,    
.          G7             C
 There's a shadow hanging over me,
.G    Am   D7       F     C
 Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

[C
.E   E7  Am  G   F
 Why she had to go,
.         G                  C
 I don't know, she wouldn't say.
.E    E7  Am   G    F
 I  said something wrong,
.       G             C
 Now I long for yesterday.

.C          E        E7           Am           G   F
 Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,    
.      G7              C
 Now I need a place to hide away,
.G   Am   D7      F     C
 Oh, I believe in yesterday.

[C
.E   E7  Am  G   F
 Why she had to go,
.         G                  C
 I don't know, she wouldn't say.
.E    E7  Am   G    F
 I  said something wrong,
.       G             C
 Now I long for yesterday.

.      G7              C
 Now I need a place to hide away,

 Oh, I believe in yesterday.

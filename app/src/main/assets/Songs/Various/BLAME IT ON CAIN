.G
 Once upon a time, I had a little money.
 Government burglars took it long before I could mail it to you.
.                  C7
 Still you are the only one.
.                              G
 Now, I can't let it slip away.
.           D
 So if the man with the ticker tape, he tries to take it,
.D7                            G
 Well, this is what I'm gonna say:

.             Em7                     G
 Blame it on Cain.  Don't blame it on me.
.                C              D         C                G
 Oh, oh, oh, it's nobody's fault, but we need somebody to burn.

 Well, if I was a saint with a silver cup
 And the money got low, we could always heat it up or trade it in.
 But then the radio that heaven will be wired to your purse.
 And then you can run down the wave band, coast to coast, hand in hand.
.D7                                                    C
 Better or worse, curse for curse, don't be disatisfied.
.            D           G
 So, you're not satisfied.
.            Em7                      G
 Blame it on Cain.  Don't blame it on me.
.                C              D
 Oh, oh, oh, it's nobody's fault,
.        C                   G
 But we need somebody to burn.

 I think I've lived a little too long on the outskirts of town.
 I think I'm goin' insane from talking to myself for so long.
 Oh, but I never been accused.
 When they step upon your face, you wear that good luck grin.
.          D7
 I gotta break out one weekend if I do somebody in.
 But ev'ry single time I feel a little stronger,
.      C                           D
 They tell me it's a crime.  Well how much longer?
.            Em7                        G
 Blame it on Cain.  Don't blame it on me.
.                C              D
 Oh, oh, oh, it's nobody's fault,
.        C                   G
 But we need somebody to burn.
.             Em7                       G
 Blame it on Cain.  Don't blame it on me.
.                C              D
 Oh, oh, oh, it's nobody's fault.
.        C                    G
 But it just seems to be his turn.</lyrics>

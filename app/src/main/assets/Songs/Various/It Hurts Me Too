;Rearranged by Eric Clapton
; Clapton uses the following riff, pretty much note-for-note as the introduction
; and both solos.  If you're feeling really authentic, substitute a slide
; for all the hammer-ons and pull-offs.  The lyrics with chords follow...

;Introduction

.                 C#
 You said you was  hurting, almost lost your mind,
.                F#
 And the man you  love, he hurts you all the time.
.               C#                    G#
 When things go  wrong, go wrong with  you,
.F#            C#    G#
  It hurts me,  too. 

.             C#
 You love him  more when you should love him less.
.            F#
 I pick up behind him and take his mess.
.               C#                    G#
 When things go  wrong, go wrong with  you,
.F#            C#    G#
  It hurts me,  too. 

.                C#
 He love another  woman and I love you,
.             F#
 But you love  him and stick to him like glue.
.               C#                    G#
 When things go  wrong, go wrong with  you,
.F#            C#    G#
  It hurts me,  too. 

;Solo

.               C#
 Now you better  leave him; he better put you down.
.            F#
 Oh, I won't  stand to see you pushed around.
.               C#                    G#
 When things go  wrong, go wrong with  you,
.F#            C#    G#
  It hurts me,  too.

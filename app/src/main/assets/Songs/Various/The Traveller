[Intro  Gmaj7 | | | | Bm | A | Bm | A

.Bm                                            F#m
 In from the coast, riding like the wind and racing the moon.
.Bm                                              F#m
 Shadows on the road, dancing and weaving like a crazy fool.
.   Bm                                           F#m
 A horseman is coming, death in his heart for a rendezvous.
.               A            A7             Bm
 And where the traveller goes, nobody knows.
.           A            A7        Bm
 Where the traveller goes, nobody knows.

 A candle in the night, fear on every face when he goes inside.
 (Maybe he's on the run)
 Get back from the bar, a stranger in town is a dangerous sight
 (maybe he's got a gun)
 bring a bottle of whiskey landlord, I want to talk for a while
 And where the traveller goes, a cold wind blows.
 Where the traveller goes, a cold wind blows.

[C
.Bm                                   A
   There is something in his eyes, something in his hands,
.         G                    Bm
 you can almost smell his revenge.
.                             A
 And whoever he is after, it will be a disaster,
.      G               F#maj                  Bm
 this man is gonna take   him to the very end.
[

 Well, the landlord he trembled staring at a face he'd seen somewhere before.
 (you laid him in the ground)
 Suddenly remembered a killing, yes, a murder many years before.
 (t'was you that shot him down)
 He said to a boy, saddle me the black, I'll meet you down below,
 with this man I must talk, with this traveller I go,
 with this man I must talk, yes with him I must go.

;Chorus

.Gmaj7              G     A
      and they were never seen again.

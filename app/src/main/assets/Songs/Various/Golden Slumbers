.Am7                              Dm7
 Once there was a way to get back homeward
.G7                               C
 Once there was a way to get back home
.Em           Am              Dm7 G7                     C
 Sleep pretty darling, do not cry and I will sing a lullabye

.Fmaj7                     C     Fmaj7                 C
 Golden slumbers fill your eyes, smiles awake when you rise
.Em           Am7             Dm7  G7                     C
 Sleep pretty darling, do not cry, And I will sing a lullabye

.Am7                              Dm7
 Once there was a way to get back homeward
.G7                               C
 Once there was a way to get back home
.Em           Am              Dm7 G7                     C
 Sleep pretty darling, do not cry and I will sing a lullabye

.Fmaj7                     C     Fmaj7                 C
 Golden slumbers fill your eyes, smiles awake when you rise
.Em           Am7             Dm7  G7                     C
 Sleep pretty darling, do not cry, And I will sing a lullabye</lyrics>

.D
 I have climbed the highest mountains
.D
 I have run through the fields
.        G
 Only to be with you
.        D
 Only to be with you

.       D
 I have run I have crawled
.A
 I have scaled these city walls
.           G
 these city walls
.        D
 Only to be with you

;Chorus
.      A             G
 But I still haven't found
.         D
 What I'm looking for
.      A             G
 But I still haven't found
.         D
 What I'm looking for

 I have kissed honey lips
 Felt the healing in her fingertips
 It burned like fire
 This burning desire

 I have spoke with the tongue of angels
 I have held the hand of a devil
 It was warm in the night
 I was cold as a stone

;Chorus

 I believe in the Kingdom Come
 Then all the colors will bleed into one
 But yes I'm still running.
 You broke the bonds
 You loosened the chains
 You carried the cross
 And my shame
 And my shame
 You know I believed it

;Chorus</lyrics>

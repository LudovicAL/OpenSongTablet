;The Mamas and the Papas

.  E7            A               F#mD
 While I'm far away from you my baby
.   E7        A               F#mD
 I know it's hard for you my baby
.    E7        F#m           C#m
 because it's hard for me my baby
.        Bm7         E7               A   E7
 and the darkest hour is just before dawn.

.                       A               E7 E6 E
 Each night before you go to bed my baby
.                    A                 E7 E6 E
 Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
.               Adim            A
 And then tell all the stars above
. N.C.  E7                         A
 This is dedicated to the one I love.

.                  A
 Life can never be exactly like we want it to be
.    A
 I could be satisfied knowing you'd love me
.    A
 there's one thing I want you to do especially for me
.          Bm        B7        E7
 And it's something everybody needs.

 Each night before you go to bed my baby
 Whisper a little prayer for me my baby
 And then tell all the stars above
 This is dedicated to the one I love.

 Life can never be exactly like we want it to be
 I could be satisfied knowing you'd love me
.  A                                   C#m   D     C#m
 there's one thing I want you to do especially for me
.   F                    E7
 And it's something everybody needs.</lyrics>

 INTRO: A   E    B7
.     A                                        E
 Well I came by your house the other day, your mother said you went away
.         D
 She said there was nothing that I could have done
.          B7
 There was nothing nobody could say
.    A                                   E
 Now me and you we've known each other ever since we were sixteen
.       D
 I wish I would've known I wished I could have called you
.        B7                      A        E   D   B7
 Just to say goodbye Bobby Jean                   

 Now you hung with me when all the others turned away turned up their noise
 We liked the same music we liked the same bands we liked the same clothes
 We told each other that we were the wildest, the wildest things we'd ever seen
 Now I wished you would have told me I wished I could have talked to you
 Just to say goodbye Bobby Jean

.    D                           F#m
 Now we went walking in the rain talking about the pain from the world we hid
.          D                                  A                      E
 Now there ain't nobody no where no how gonna ever understand me the way you did

 Maybe you'll be out there on that road somewhere
 In some bus or train traveling along
 In some motel room there'll be a radio playing
 And you'll hear me sing this song
 Well if you do you'll know I'm thinking of you and all the miles in between
 And I'm just calling one last time not to change your mind
.B7                D                             E
 But just to say I miss you baby, good luck, goodbye, Bobby Jean</lyrics>

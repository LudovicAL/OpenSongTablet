;Intro

.E           B           C#           A
 Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
 Sometimes I feel like my only friend
 Is the city I live in the City of Angels
 Lonely as I am
.                Emaj7_7fret
 Together we cry 

 I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
 I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
 She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
 I never worry
 Now that is a lie.

[C
.F#m_9fret            E_7fret
 I don't ever want to feel
.B_11fret
 Like I did that day
 Take me to the place I love
 Take me all way
[

 It's hard to believe there's nobody out there
 It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
 At least I got her love the city she loves me
 Lonely as I am
 Together we cry

;chorus

 Under the bridge downtown
 Is where I drew some blood
 Under the bridge downtown
 I could not get enough
 Under the bridge downtown
 Forgot about my love
 Under the bridge downtown
 I gave my life away</lyrics>

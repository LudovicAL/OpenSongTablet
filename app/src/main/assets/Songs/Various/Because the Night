;intro
.Bm G A Bm G A Bm
       
.Bm      G          A         Bm
 Take me now, baby, here as I am.
.Bm       G            A      Bm
 Pull me close try and understand.
.   Bm     G              A      Bm
 Desire is hunger, is the fire I breathe.
.Bm         G         A          Bm
 Love is a banquet on which we feed.
.G       A            D    A
 Come on now, try and understand
.    Bm    G                     A
 the way I feel when I'm in your hand.
.D       G                A
 Take my hand; come under cover.
.     C                   Bm                  F#
 They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now.

;chorus:
[C]
.Bm          G       A        Bm
 Because the night belongs to lovers.
.Bm          G       A        Bm
 Because the night belongs to lust.
.Bm          G       A        Bm
 Because the night belongs to lovers.
.Bm          G       A        Bm
 Because the night belongs to us.
[]

 Have I doubt when I'm alone?
 Love is a ring on the telephone.
 Love is an angel disguised as lust,
 here in our bed until the morning comes.
 Come on now, try and understand
 the way I feel under your command.
 Take my hand as the sun descends.
 They can't touch you now, can't touch you now, can't touch you now.

;Repeat chorus

.     D    A         D        A           Bm   A
 With love we sleep; with doubt the viscious circle turn and turns.
.D  A     Bm    A    D        A
 Without you I cannot live, forgive the yearning, burning
.    G     D    G
 I believe in time, too real to feel,
.   Bm   D        G              F#
 so touch me now, touch me now, touch me now.

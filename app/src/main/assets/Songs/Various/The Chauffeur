;Duran Duran

.Em         D           G              B7/D#   Em  D               G            B7/D#
 Out on the tar plains, the glides are moving, all looking for the new place to drive
.Em        D        G        B7/D#     Em         D                  G               B7/D#
 You sit beside me, so newly charming, sweatening dew drops glisten, freshing your side

[C
.        G                      B7                Em                      B
 And the sun slips down bedding heavy behind, the front of your dress all shadowy lined
.        G              B                   Em              B
 And the droning engine throbs in time with your beating heart
[
.G         B7
           

.Em           D          G           B7/D#       Em         D               G          B7/D#
 Way down the lane away, living for another day, the aphids climb up in the drifting haze
.Em           D            G                 B7/D#         Em        D              G             B7/D#
 Swim seagull in the sky towards that hollow western isle, my envied lady holds you fast in her gaze

;chorus (twice)
.        B7
 (... heart ...)

.C   C/Bb   B      Em        D         G         B/D#
 Sing, blue silver                               

.Em           D            G          B7/D#    Em         D                G              B7/D#
 And watching lovers part, I feel you smiling, what glass splinters lie so deep in your mind?
.Em          D                     G               B7/D#
 To tear out from your eyes with a word to stiffen brooding lies
.Em            D                  G           B7/D#
 But I'll only watch you leave me further behind

;chorus (twice)
.        B7
 (... heart ...)

.C   C/Bb   B      Em        D         G         B/D#
 Sing, blue silver                               
.C         C/Bb   B      Em        D         G         B/D#
 Sing, sing, blue silver                               
.Em        D         G         B/D#

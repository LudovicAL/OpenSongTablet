.G   C                       D
     So, so ya think you can tell,
.             Am
 Heaven from  hell,
.                G
 Blue skies from pain,
.                     D
 Can you tell a green field
.                  C
 From a cold steel rail,
.               Am
 A smile from a veil?
.                   G
 Do ya think ya can tell?

.G                       C
     Did they get you to trade,
.                D
 Your hero's for ghosts,
.              Am
 Hot ashes for trees
.               G
 Hot air for a cool breeze,
.                 D
 Cold comfort for change,
.            C
 Did you exchange,
.                      Am
 A walk on part in the war,
.                     G
 for a lead role in a cage?

.G   C                               D
     How I wish, how I wish you were here,
.          Am
 Were just two lost soles simming in a fish bowl,
.G                  D
   Year after year, 
 Running over the same old ground,
.            C
 But have we found
.             Am
 The same old fears,
.              G
 Wish you were here</lyrics>

 Yesterday,
.E7                        Am
 All my troubles seemed so far away,
.F       G7                      C
 Now it seems as though they're here to stay,
.    Am    F          C
 Oh, I believe in yesterday.

 Suddenly,
 I'm not half the man I used to be,
 There's a shadow hanging over me,
 Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

.E7      Am  G7  F
 Why she had to go,
.         G7                 C
 I don't know, she wouldn't say.
.Am   E7  Am   E7   F
 I  said something wrong,
.       G7           C
 Now I long for yesterday.

 Yesterday,
 Love was such an easy game to play,
 Now I need a place to hide away,
 Oh, I believe in yesterday.

 Why she had to go,
 I don't know, she wouldn't say.
 I said something wrong,
 Now I long for yesterday.

 Yesterday,
 Love was such an easy game to play,
 Now I need a place to hide away,
 Oh, I believe in yesterday.

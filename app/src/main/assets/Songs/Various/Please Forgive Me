;Intro

.Esus4 A                   C#7           E
  It stills feels like our first night together
 Feels like the first kiss
.F#m
 And it's getting better, baby
.C#7                   D
 No one can better this
.A
 Still holding on
.E
 Your still the one

.A
 First time our eyes met
.C#7
 Same feeling I get
.F#m
 Only feels much stronger
.C#7
 Only love you longer
.A                  D      E
 You still turn the fire on
[C]
;chorus
.              F#m     A         D
 So, if you're feeling lonely... don't
.E                           A
 You're the only one I ever want
.       F#m   A       D
 I only wanna make it good
.E                          F#m         D
 So, If I love you a little more than I should

.A
 Please forgive me, I know not what I do
.F#m
 Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
.D
 Don't deny me , this pain I'm going through
.A
 Please forgive me, I need you like I do
.E                                           D
 Oh believe me, every word I say is true     
.A                              E
 Please forgive me, I can't stop loving you
[]

 Still feels like our best times are together
 Feels like the first touch
 Still getting closer baby
 Can't get close enough
 Still holding on
 You're still number one

.A
 I remember the smell of your skin
.C#7
 I remember everything
.F#m
 I remember all of your moves
.C#7
 I remember you, yeah
.A                                       E
 I remember the nights, you know I still do

;chorus

.E
 The one thing I'm sure of
.A
 Is the way we make love
.E
 The one thing I depend on
.A
 Is for us to stay strong
.F#m                                   D
 With every word and every breath I'm praying
.E
 that's why I'm saying

[C]

 Please forgive me, if I need you like I do
.F#                                            E
 Babe, believe me, every word I say is true

;U2 with B.B. King

;Intro (guitar part just as in the first two lines of verse)
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

 {cbVerse1(Bono)}
.E                             A   E
 I was a sailor, I was lost in sea 
.E                                          A   E
 I was under the waves, before loves resqued me 
.E                                 A    E
 I was a fighter I could turn on threat 
.    E   N.C.
 Now I stand accused of things I've said.

 {cbChorus(B.B.)}
[C
.A
 Love comes to town,
.                          A
 I'm gonna jump that train 
.      E
 When love comes to town,
.                           A      E
 I'm gonna catch that flame.       
 Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down,
.      E   N.C.
 But I did what I did before love came to town.
[

 {cbVerse 2(Bono)}
 Used to make love under the red sunset,
 I was making promises I that were soon to forget.
 She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown,
 But I left her standing before love came to town.

 {cbVerse 3(Bono)}
 Ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream,
 The notes were turning blue as days are a dream.
 As the music played I saw my life turn around
 That was the day before love came to town.

 {cbChorus(B.B.)}
;solo The Edge
 {cbChorus(B.B.) over The Edge's solo}
;solo B.B. King

 {cbVerse 4(B.B.)}
 I was there when they crusified my lord
 I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
 I threw the dice as they pierced his side,
 But I've seen love conquer the great divide.

 {cbChorus(B.B.)}
;The second solo by B.B. King
 "Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.........."

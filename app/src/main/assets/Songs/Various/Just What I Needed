.E       E       E       E
                         
.E       E       E       E
                         
.E                     B               C#m                G#
      I don't mind you coming here,        wasting all my time.
.E                                B                C#m                   G#
      'Cause when you're standing oh, so---- near,     I kind of lose my  mind.
.E                         B              C#m                       G#
      It's not the perfume that you wear;      it's not the ribbons  in your hair.
.E                     B                G#                      A
      I don't mind you coming here           and wasting all my time.

.E       B       C#m       G#
                           
.E       B       C#m       A    B    E
                                     

.E                     B              C#m                      G#
      I don't mind you hanging out         and talking in your sleep.
.E                      B                 C#m                    G#
      It does'nt matter where you've been      as long as it was deep.
.E                       B                   C#m                     G#
      You always knew to wear it well-- and       you look so fancy. I can tell.
.E                     B              G#                       A
      I don't mind you hanging out         and talking in your sleep.

.E       B           A               C#m B
          I guess you're just what I needed.
.E       B      A             C#m
          I needed someone to feed.
.E       B           A               C#m B
          I guess you're just what I needed.
.E       B      A             C#m
          I needed someone to bleed.

;Intro:
.E      D      C
               
.E      D      A7       C      G
                               
.G      B      Em       C
                        

.G        B            Em
 I'm not proud, I was wrong
.        C                 G
 And the truth is hard to take
.        B             Em
 I felt sure we had enough
.         C                G
 But our love went overboard
.         B             Em
 Lifeboat lies lost at sea
.          C                    G
 I've been trying to reach your shore
.         B                  Em
 Waves of doubt keep drowning me

.Am7 Bm7 Cmaj7                 Am9
 All the dreams that we were building
.B7              Em
 We never fulfilled them
.          Cmaj7            Am9
 Could be better, should be better for
.B7+5            E     D
 Lessons in love       

 For restless eyes, egos burn
 and the mould is hard to break
 Now we've waded in too deep
 And love is overboard
 Heavy hearts, token words
 All the hopes I've ever had
 Fade like footprints in the sand

.Am7 Bm7 Cmaj7                Am9
 All the homes that we were building
.B7           Em
 We never lived in
.         Cmaj7             Am9
 Could be better, should be better
.B7+5         Em
 Lessons in love
.      Cmaj7           Am9
 If we lose the time before us
.B7                 Em
 The future will ignore us
.         Cmaj7             Am9
 We could use it, we should use it
.B7+5        E     D     C
 Lessons in love         

.              E    D     A7
 Lost without love        
.C          G          F             C        D
 Lessons in love, when will you ever learn?   
.           G                  F               C     D
 Lessons in love, when there's nowhere left to turn  
.           G           F               C     D
 Lessons in love, don't let your spirit burn  
.           G          F               C     D
 Lessons in love, I'll wait till you return

.D       G        B       Em        C        G      B     Em
                                                          
.Am7   Bm7   Cmaj7
 All  the    dreams
.             Am9        B7
 that we were building   
.             Em
 We never lived them
.         Cmaj7              Am9
 We could lose it, we should use it
.B7+5         Em
 Lessons in love

 All the homes that we were building
 we never lived in
 Could be better, should be better
 Lessons in love

 If we lose the time before us
 The future will ignore us
 We should use it, we could lose it

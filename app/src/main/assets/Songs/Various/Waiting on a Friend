;Intro
.Csus2         Dm            F
                             

.Am              F           G                   C
 Watchin girls a-passin' by, it ain't the latest thing
.G                      C        G                            C
 I'm just standin' in a doorway, I'm just tryin' to make some sense

.Am                   F               G                   C
 Out of these girls a-passin' by, the tales they tell of men
.G                      C   G                     C
 I'm not waitin' on a lady, I'm just waiting on a friend

.Am                   F                 G               C
 A smile relieves the heart that bleeds remember what I said
.G                    C      G                     C
 I'm not waitin' on a lady   I'm just waiting on a friend

;Solo
.Csus2         Dm           F
                            
.Am                   F                    G                   C
 Don't need a whore I don't need no booze, don't need a virgin priest
.G                        C       G                 C
 But I need someone I can cry to, I need someone to protect

.Am             F               G                C
 Makin love and breakin hearts, it is a game for youth
.G                        C     G                    C
 But I'm not waiting on a lady, I'm just waitin on a friend</lyrics>

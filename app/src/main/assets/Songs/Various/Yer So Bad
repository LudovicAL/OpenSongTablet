.Am            Am/F#     G         Am                  Am/F#      G
 My sister got lucky,    married a yuppie took him for all he was worth
.Am          Am/F#       G        Am               Am/F#         G
 Now she's a swinger,    dating a singer I can't decide which is worse

;Chorus
.G   Em  C  G D             Em  C  G    D
 But not me baby,  I've got you to save me
.   G   D  C    G            D    C        G     D    C     G   D  C    D
 Oh yer so bad, best thing I ever had in a world gone bad,  yer so bad  

.Am             Am/F#    G            Am                  Am/F#         G
 My sister's ex-husband  can't get no lovin' walks around dog faced and hurt
.Am           Am/F#     G           Am             Am/F#         G
 Now he's got nothin',  head in the oven I can't decide which is worse

;Chorus
.G   Em  C  G D             Em  C  G    D
 But not me baby,  I've got you to save me
.   G   D  C    G            D    C        G     D    C     G   D  C    D
 Oh yer so bad, best thing I ever had in a world gone bad,  yer so bad  

;Lead solo over verse

;Chorus
.G   Em  C  G D             Em  C  G    D
 But not me baby,  I've got you to save me
.   G   D  C    G            D    C        G     D    C     G   D  C    D
 Oh yer so bad, best thing I ever had in a world gone bad,  yer so bad</lyrics>

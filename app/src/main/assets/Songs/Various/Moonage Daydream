;(D 5th fret, F# 9th fret)
.D             N.C.
               I'm an alligator,
.F#            N.C.                      B
               I'm a mama-papa comin' for you
.A                   E                                     G
 I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
.                     D                                    F#
 Keep your mouth shut, you're sqauwkin' like a pink monkey bird
;(E  1st fret)
.                                     B       A     E
 and I'm busting up my brains for the words         

;chorus
[C
.G          D              E
 Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
.G        D             E
 Put your ray gun to my head
.G          D                   E
 Press your space face close to mine, love
;(D 5th, E 7th fret)
.D                                  E
    Freak out in a moonage daydream oh! yeah!
[

 Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
 The church of man, love, is such a holy place to be
 Make me baby, make me know you really care
 Make me jump into the air

 (repeat chorus)

;BREAK

 (repeat chorus 2x)

;Outro
.D               A             G   F

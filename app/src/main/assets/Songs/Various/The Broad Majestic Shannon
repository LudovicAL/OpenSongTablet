.D G  D Bm  D G  A D
                   
.    D                                   G
 The last time I saw you was down at the Greeks
.          D                     G            Bm
 There was whiskey on Sunday and tears on our cheeks
.A   D                             G
 You sang me a song as pure as the breeze
.     D            G       A
 on a road leading up Glenaveigh
.  D                      G
 I sat for a while at the cross at Finnoe
.            D                          G               Bm
 Where young lovers would meet when the flowers were in bloom
.A     D                                        G
 Heard the men coming home from the fair at Shinrone
.      D              G        A         D
 Their hearts in Tipperary wherever they go
.        D                  G     A
 Take my hand, and dry your tears babe
.        D                 G     A
 Take my hand, forget your fears babe
.           D                     G  A
 There's no pain, there's no more sorrow
.            D     G             A
 They're all gone,   gone in the years babe

 I sat for a while by the gap in the wall
 Found a rusty tin can and an old hurley ball
 Heard the cards being dealt, and the rosary called
 And a fiddle playing Sean Dun na nGall
 And the next time I see you we'll be down at the Greeks
 There'll be whiskey on Sunday and tears on our cheeks
 For it's stupid to laugh and it's useless to bawl
 About a rusty tin can and an old hurley ball

.     D                     G   A
 So I walked as the day was dawning
.                  D                    G   A
 Where small birds sang and leaves were falling
.              D                     G   A
 Where we once watched the row boats landing
.       D     G         A   D
 By the broad  majestic Shannon

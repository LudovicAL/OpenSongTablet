;Intro
.E    A    E    A    G#m       F#m       E    A
                                              

.           E     A                  E               A                E
 If not for  you,    Babe I couldn't  find the door,    Couldn't even  see
 the floor,
.A                G#m    F#m           E     A  E  A
   I'd be sad and  blue,    If not for  you.       

.           E     A                E               A               E
 If not for  you,    Babe I'd lay awake all night,    Wait for the  morning
 light
.A              G#m       F#m
    To shine in  through, 
.                    G#m   F#m         E     A  E  A
 But it would not be  new,  If not for  you.       

[C]
.A               E                   B                   E
 If not for you,  my sky would fall;  rain would gather,  too.
.A                        E
 Without your love I'd be  nowhere at all
.F#               B      A        G#m      F#m
 Oh! What would I  do if  not for          
.B    A    G#m       F#m     E    A

.           E     A              E                A                 E
 If not for  you,   Winter would  have no spring,   Couldn't hear a  robin
 sing,
.A                        G#m    F#m
   I just wouldn't have a  clue, 
.                        G#m    F#m         E     A
 Anyway it wouldn't ring  true,  If not for  you. 
.           E     A
 If not for  you. 

;Chorus

.           E     A                  E               A                E
 If not for  you,    Babe I couldn't  find the door,    Couldn't even  see
 the floor,
.A                G#m    F#m           E     A  E  A
   I'd be sad and  blue,    If not for  you.

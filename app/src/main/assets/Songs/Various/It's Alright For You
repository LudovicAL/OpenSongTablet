;Sting, Stewart Copeland

.D     E         D
  Wake  up, Make  up,
.         E          D
 Bring it  up, Shake  up,
.      E          D
 Stand  by, Don't  cry
.         E                   A7
 Watching  while the world die

 Big car, Movie star
 Hot tip, Go far
 Blind date, Too late
 Take a bus, Don't wait

[C]
.B                A
 It's alright for you
.B                A
 It's alright for you
.B                A
 It's alright for you
.        E
 For you and you and you and you and you

.B                A
 It's alright for you
.B                A
 It's alright for you
.B                A
 It's alright for you
.        E              D
 For you and you and you

 Limp wrist, Tight fist
 Contact, No twist
 Black dress, No mess
 Mm, don't want no less (No less)

 Stand by, Don't cry
 Watching while the world die
 Three lane, Fast lane
 Standing in the cold rain

;Chorus

 Headlight, High life
 Can't sleep, Good night
 Up tight, Big fight
 Big deal, Too right (Too right)

 Big town, Don't drown
 Jump back, Turn around
 No life, Flick knife
 Finish off my life

;Chorus</lyrics>

. Em       Am7      Em       A
 (  /  /     /  /     /  /     /  /  )  x2

.     Em          Am7            Em           Am7
 The horns in the fog, could be heard if not seen
. Em          C          D             G
 Helping to guide, the blind in a dream
.G/F#     Em             Am7      Em             Am7
     And down by the seashore, a banquet she gave
.         Em            C            D                Em
 She was feeding, and needing, the soul she could save
.                 Bm            C         CsusC
 Mama lion, mama lion, you're starting to sink
.             Em              Bm                 C                  Csus  C
 Beneath the sunshine and the icicles, and the things that you think      
.           Em         Bm              C                      Em  Am7  Em
 There's a hole in my destiny and I'm out on the brink, mama lion      
.A      Em   Am7   Em   A
  Mama lion             

.     Em              Am7           Em              Am7
 She bounces off the boulders, she runs on the rocks
.       Em          C              D               G
 She's taking her time, from her grandfather clocks
.G/F#    Em          Am7       Em             Am7
     And over the border, and down on the land
.       Em              C            D              Em
 She's living in the future, and it lies in her hand
.                 Bm            C             Csus C
 Mama lion, mama lion, you're starting to sink
.             Em              Bm                 C                  Csus C
 Beneath the sunshine and the icicles, and the things that you think
.           Em         Bm              C                      Em  Am7  Em
 There's a hole in my destiny and I'm out on the brink, mama lion,   mmmm
.A      Em   Am7   Em   A
  Mama lion            mmmm

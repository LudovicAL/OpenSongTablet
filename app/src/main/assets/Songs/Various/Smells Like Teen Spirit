.F    Bb     Ab       C#              F
 Load up on guns and bring your friends
.      Bb     Ab      C#     F
 It's fun to lose and to pretend
.      Bb   Ab        C#     F
 She's over bored and self assured
.  Bb      Ab     C#     F
 I know, I know a dirty word

. Bb     Ab     C#        F
 hello, hello, hello, how low? (4x)

.         F        Bb           Ab    C#
 With the lights out it's less dangerous
.        F    Bb       Ab   C#
 Here we are now, entertain us
.       F     Bb      Ab   C#
 I feel stupid and contagious
.        F    Bb       Ab   C#
 Here we are now, entertain us
.  F            Bb         Ab            C#
 A mulatto - An albino - A mosquito - My libido
 Yeah

 I'm worse at what I do best
 And for this gift I feel blessed
 Our little group has always been
 And always will until the end

 hello, hello, hello, how low? (4x)

;chorus

;solo

 And I forget just what it takes
 And yet I guess it makes me smile
 I found it hard, it's hard to find
 Oh well, whatever, nevermind

 hello, hello, hello, how low? (4x)

;chorus
 A denial - A denial - A denial...</lyrics>

.          F#m7-5    B7             Em
 There's a moon over Bourbon Street tonight
.      F#m7-5        B7               Em
 I see faces as they pass beneath the pale lamp light
.        C             B7          Em
 I've no choice but to follow that call
.    C#dim              F#7             C        B7
 the bright lights, the people, and the moon and all
.F#m7-5       B7        Em
 I pray every day to be strong
.      F#m7-5      B7         Em
 for I know what I do must be wrong

[C]
.          C            B/F#              Em
 Oh you'll never see my shade or hear the sound of my feet
.                C         B7      Em
 while there's a moon over Bourbon Street
[]

.       F#m7-5     B7                Em
 It was many years ago that I became what I am
.      F#m7-5          B7           Em
 I was trapped in this life like an innocent lamb
.      C             B7      Em
 now I never show my face at noon
.    C#dim              F#7            C            B7
 and you'll only see me walking by the light of the moon
.    F#m7-5     B7            Em
 the brim of my hat hides the eye of a beast
.         F#m7-5    B7             Em
 I've the face of a sinner but the hands of a priest

;    In the above chords, if you are having difficulty, in the F#m7-5 drop the
; F# bass note and use the open A string. The C#dim you can also drop C# bass
; note. The Em and C are just regular "open" position chords.
;    The song appears on the Sting album "dream of the blue turtles". If you
; get the song try working out the bass line and play it along with the chords.

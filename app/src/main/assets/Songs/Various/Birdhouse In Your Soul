;They Might Be Giants

;Intro:
. B              E                   D
 I'm your only friend, I'm not your only friend
.    F#              A
 But I'm a little glowing friend
.      D             C              F#                B
 But really I'm not actually your friend - but I am - 

;Chorus:
[C]
.B                    E                        B            E
 Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch Who watches over you?
.B       F#      G#m     F#
 make a little birdhouse in your soul
.D               G                  D                G
 Not to put too fine a point on it say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
.D       Bm       G      F#
 make a little birdhouse in your soul
[]
.B E B E
       
.B            E            B            E
   I have a secret to tell   from my electrical well
.B         F#      B7              E               F#
   it's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
;repeat

 so the room must listen to me - filibuster vigilantly
 my name is blue canary - one note spelled l-i-t-e

.G#m        G#m+     G#m6               G#m+
 My story's infinite  like the Longines Symphonette
.    F#
 it doesn't rest

;Chorus

;Instrumental/Bridge:
.G#m G#m+ G#m6 G#m+
       
.Eb Db Ab Eb
          
. G#             C#                   B
 I'm your only friend - I'm not your only friend
.    D#             F#
 But I'm a little glowing friend
.      B             A              F#
 But really I'm not actually your friend - but I am -

 There's a picture opposite me of my primitive ancestry
 which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
 though I respect that a lot I'd be fired if that were my job
 after killing Jason off and countless screaming argonauts

 Bluebird of friendliness - like guardian angels it's always near

;repeat Chorus

;Chorus (2):
.B       E                    B                   E
   And while you're at it - leave the night light on inside
.     B        F#      G#m  F#
 the birdhouse in your soul 
 not to put too fine a point on it - say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
 make a little birdhouse in your soul

;Chorus (both parts):
 Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch   And while you're at it,
 who watches over you?                           leave the night light on inside
 make a little birdhouse in your soul            the birdhouse in your soul

 not to put too fine a point on it - say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
 make a little birdhouse in your soul

;Repeat chorus with both parts</lyrics>

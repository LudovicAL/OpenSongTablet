.C          Em    Am
 Another day goes by
.           F                  C
 Still you wonder what happened
.                    Em              Am
 You'd give the world for one more try
.            F
 But you're too shy to ask him
.      Fm                     Am
 You don't want to ask him now
.                 C                 F
 I know your heart will pull you through
.                    G
 If he means that much to you, yeah

;CHORUS:
.                   C
 You gotta let him know (Let him know, know that you love him)
.                       Em
 Let him know that you love him (Let him know, know that you need him)
.                   Bb                                         F
 You gotta let him know (Let him know, know that you want him now)

.C              Em            Am
 What can I say? It's up to you
.          F                   C
 You gotta make up your own mind
.            Em                Am
 It's your life, it's up to you
.            F
 Cause you didn't believe me
.     Fm                       Am
 You still don't believe me now
.              C                    F
 You're gonna see it's all coming true
.                          G
 That's why I'm leaving it up to you, yeah

;CHORUS

.Ab  Eb Db
        
.                                              Eb  Db  Ab
 The news is out I guess you heard                     
.                                                 Eb  Db  Ab
 You shouldn't breathe a single word                      
.Eb     Db
        
.G
 The bottom line is nothing's going to stop you now
 You gotta let him know....</lyrics>

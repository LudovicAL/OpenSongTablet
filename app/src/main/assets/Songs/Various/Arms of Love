;INTRO:
.G       C            G     C G
                              

;Verse:
.G     C              G     CG
 Maybe tonight you're aching,
.G                  F        C
 for someone you're dreamin' of.
.D        G         C
 Tomorrow you'll be wakin',
.D        G       C
 into the arms of love.

 Maybe tonight you're cryin',
 like a poor wounded dove.
 Tell me you'll soon be flyin',
 into the arms of love.

 Maybe tonight you're takin',
 you couldn't get enough.
 Honey you'll soon be wakin',
 into the arms of love.

 Maybe the world is fallin',
 it wasn't strong enough.
 Tell me you'll soon be callin',
 into the arms of love,

.D           G     C
 into the arms of love,
.D           G     C
 into the arms of love,
.D           G     C
 into the arms of love.</lyrics>

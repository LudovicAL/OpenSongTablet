.        G              Am
 Perhaps love is like a resting place
.  C                D
 A shelter from the storm
.     G                Am
 It exists to give you comfort
.     C                 D
 It's there to keep you warm
.    G                 D
 And in those times of trouble
.     C              Am
 When you are most alone
.    C         D                   G
 The memory of love will bring you home

 Perhaps love is like a window
 Perhaps an open door
 It invites you to come closer
 It wants to show you more
 And even if you lose yourself
 And don't know what to do
 The memory of love will see you through

.        Am              E
 ** Oh ! Love to some is like a cloud
.   Am                E
 To some as strong as steel
.    Am            E
 For some a way of living
.    Am            E
 For some a way to feel
.    C                D
 And some say love is holding on
.    C               Am
 And some say let it go
.    C                Am
 And some say love is everything
.C                   D
 Some say they don't know

 Perhaps love is like the ocean
 Full of conflicts , full of pain
 Like a fire when it's cold outside
 Thunder when it rains
 If I should live forever
 And all my dreams come true
 My memory of love will be of you

 Repeat ** to fade</lyrics>

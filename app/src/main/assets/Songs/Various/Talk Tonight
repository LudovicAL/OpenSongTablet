;OASIS
;B-side of Some Might Say - the new single.

.Em
 Sitting on my own, chewing on a bone
.Am
 A thousand million miles from home, and
.C                G        Am                          C
 Something        hit me,  somewhere right between the eyes

 Sleeping on a plane, you know you can't complain
 You took your last chance once again, and
 Landed, stranded, hardly even knew your name

;Chorus
.C                     G D Em
 I want to talk tonight
.          C            G D Em
 Until the morning light
.          C                G D Em
 'bout how you saved my life
.C                       Em
 You and me know how we are
.C                       Em
 You and me know how we are

 All your dreams are made of strawberry lemonade
 And you make sure I eat today, you
 Take me       walking, to where you played when you were young

 I'll never say that I won't ever make you cry
 And this I say I don't know why, I
 know I'm        leaving, but I'll be back another day</lyrics>

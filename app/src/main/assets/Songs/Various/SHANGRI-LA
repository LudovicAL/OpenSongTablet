.  A             E
 Sitting here, waiting for,
. F#m            C#m
 Someone calling at my door,
.     D   Bm7-5                  A
 Too bad,    I'm getting out of love.

 What's the use of changing things,
 Wonder what tomorrow brings,
 Who knows,
 I'm getting out of love.

;CHORUS
.A                        D
 My Shangri-la has gone away,
.C#m7             Gj7
 Faded like the Beatles on Hey Jude
.A                               D
 She seemed to drift out on the rain
.       C#m7             Gj7
 That came in somewhere softly from the blue

. Bm7-5       E6     A                  Aj7
 I'm getting out of love (where is my Shangri-La?)
 Clouds roll by and hide the sun,
 Raindrops fall on everyone,
 So sad,
 I'm getting out of love.

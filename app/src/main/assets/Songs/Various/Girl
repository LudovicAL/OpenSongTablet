.         Am      E               C     Am
 Is there anybody going to listen to my story
.Dm          G7               C      E
 all about a girl who came to stay?  
.          Am               E               C         Am
 She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
.Dm                 G7            C    E
 still, you don't regret a single day  
.    C    Am   Dm   G7       C    Am  Dm  G7
 Ah, gi-------------rl!      gi-----------rl!

.       Am               E                   C       Am
 When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
.Dm               G7              C       E
 She will turn to me and start to cry     
.        Am           E               C   Am
 And she promises the earth to me and I believe her.
.Dm             G7                C       E
 After all this time I don't know why.    
.    C    Am   Dm   G7       C    Am  Dm  G7
 Ah, gi-------------rl!      gi-----------rl!

.                       Dm           A7
 She's the kind of girl who puts you down
.                                   Dm
 when friends are there, you feel a fool.
.            A7
 Tit tit tit dTittittittit Tittittittit
.Dm
 When you say she's looking good
.    A7
 she acts as if it's unterstood.
.      Dm          F
 She's cool, cool, cool, cool.
.C    Am   Dm   G7       C    Am  Dm  G7
 Gi-------------rl!      gi-----------rl!

.        Am                E                     C       Am
 Was she told when she was young that fame would lead to pleasure?
.Dm           G7                 C      E
 Did she understand it when they said   
.       Am                 E                C      Am
 That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
.Dm               G7              C      E
 Will she still believe when he's dead?  
.    C    Am   Dm   G7       C    Am  Dm  G7
 Ah, gi-------------rl!      gi-----------rl!</lyrics>

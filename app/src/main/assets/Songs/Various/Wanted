.Dm            A#
 Sitting in an armchair,
.   F               C
 my head between my hands
.   Dm               A#
 I wouldn't have to be like this
.   F               C
 if you'd only understand

.Dm          A#
 Too many misundertandings
.F            C
 causing such delay
.    Dm            A#
 And If it doesn't work like this
.          F           C
 well I'll try another way

.Dm A#    F                   C
 Ohhhh If this is the way you wanted it
.Dm A#   F           C
 Ohhhh I didn't understand
.Dm A#    F                   C
 Ohhhh If this is the way you wanted it
.Dm A#   F           C
 Ohhhh I didn't understand

.    Dm              A#
 You know that all I wanted
.       F                C
 was to be there by your side.
.    Dm            A#
 And if you didn't want it
.         F           C
 Then you shouldn't have denied.

.    Dm                 A#
 You knew that you were someone special
.F              C
 right from the start
.    Dm              A#
 But if you treat me badly
.        F          C
 we'd be better off apart.

.Dm A#    F                   C
 Ohhhh If this is the way you wanted it
.Dm A#   F           C
 Ohhhh I didn't understand
.Dm A#    F                   C
 Ohhhh If this is the way you wanted it
.Dm A#   F           C
 Ohhhh I didn't understand

.Dm A# F C
     (with a lot of "ohs") x9
.Dm A# F

.E                            B                     E
 I don't wanna see you 'cause I don't miss you that much.

 I'm not a telehone junkie. I told you that we were
.A    E      B                  A        E
 just good friends.  But when I hold you like I
.A         E         A  E    B
 hold that bake-lite in my hands,

 I just wanna put  you  down.

 He's got the keys to the car, they are the keys to the
.    E     B           E                           B
 kingdom.     He's got ev'rything you need. It's a shame

 If I'm inserting my coin I'm doing just fine.  And
.    A            E          A       E  B
 the things in my head start hurtin' my mind.  And I
.A               E          A       E   A
 think about the way things used to be, knowing you

 with him is driving me crazy.  Sometimes I phone you
.       A               E             F#m
 when I know you're not lonely, but I always disconnect it

 in time.

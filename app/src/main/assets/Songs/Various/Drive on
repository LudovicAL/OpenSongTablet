.C
 I got a friend named Whisky Sam
.F
 He was my boony red (?) buddy for a year in 'Nam
.G
 He said 'I think my country got a little off track'
.C
 It took him 25 years to welcome it back

.C
 But it's better than not coming back at all
.F
 Many a good man I saw fall
.G
 And even now, sometimes when I dream
.C
 I hear the men and the monkeys and the jungle scream

;chorus
[C]
.C
 Drive on, it don't mean nothing
.F
 Children love me but they don't understand
.G
 And I got a woman who knows her man
.C
 Drive on, it don't mean nothing
.                       G7    C
 It don't mean nothing, drive on

 I remember one night when Tex and me
 Rappled in on a hot LZ
 We had our 16's on rock-and-roll
 And with all of that fire I was scared and cool

 I was crazy, and I was wild
 I had seen the tiger smile
 I spit in a bamboo viper's face
 And I'd be dead but by God's grace

;chorus

 It was a long walk in a sad rain
 And nobody tried to be John Wayne
 I came home, but Tex did not
 And I can't talk about the hit he got

 Now I got a little limp when I walk
 And I got a little tremolo when I talk
 But the letter I got from Whisky Sam
 Said 'you're a walking, talking miracle from Vietnam'

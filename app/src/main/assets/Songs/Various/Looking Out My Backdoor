[V1]
.G                           Em
 Just got home from Illinois lock the front door oh boy
.C          G           D                  D-E-F
 Got to set down take a rest on the porch  
.G                   Em
 Imagination sets in pretty soon I'm singing
.C       G           D           G
 Doo doo doo looking out my back door

[V2]
 There's a giant doing cartwheels a statue wearing high heels
 Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
 Dinosaur victrola listening to Buck Owens
 Doo doo doo looking out my back door

[C]
.D                             C              G
 Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
.                      Em            A     D
 Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon doo doo doo
.G                    Em
 Wondrous apparitions provided by a magician
.C       G           D           G
 Doo doo doo looking out my back door

 Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
 Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon doo doo doo
 Wait until tomorrow today I'll buy no sorrow
 Doo doo doo looking out my back door

.A E C G
       

[V3]
 Just got home from Illinois lock the front door oh boy
 Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn  (slow down)
 Wait until tomorrow today I'll buy no sorrow
 Doo doo doo looking out my back door</lyrics>

; detune your guitar to Eb to play along with the record
.G      G/B Cadd9     Am7            C       D         G
 Sayin' I love you is not the word I want to hear from you
.     G/B        Cadd9    Am7            C      D    Em
 It's not that I want you not to say but if you only knew
.    Am7  D              G       D/F#    Em
 How easy it would be to show me how you feel
.          Am7      D               G7    G7/B    C
 More than words is all you have to do to make it real
.         Cm               G            Em7
 Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
.       Am7   D7    G
 'cause I'd already know
.     G/B       D/F#     Em        Bm7     C
 What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
.                        C/B Am7            D              G
 More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
.     G/B       D/F#     Em         Bm7   C
 What would you say if I took those words away?
.                             Am7         D7             G
 Then you couldnt make things new just by sayin' "I love you"
.G/BCadd9             Am7              C

.G        G/B    Cadd9    Am7             C        D    G
 Now that I have tried to talk to you and make you understand
.G/B     Cadd9         Am7                 C          D        Em
 All you have to do is close your eyes and just reach out your hand
.    Am7      D                   G    D/F#   Em
 and touch me Hold me close don't ever let me go
.          Am7      D          G7     G7/B   C
 More than words is all I ever needed you to show
.         Cm               G            Em7
 Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
.       Am7   D7    G
 'cause I'd already know
.     G/B       D/F#     Em        Bm7     C
 What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
.                        C/B Am7            D              G

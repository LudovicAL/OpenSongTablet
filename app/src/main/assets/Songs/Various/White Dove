.D              A
    A place without a name
.Em         Bm
    Under a burnin' sky
.D                 A
   There's no milk and honey here
.Em                Bm
    In the land of god
.D         A
   Someone holds a sign, it says
.Em               Bm
    We are human, too
.D                A
    And while the sun goes down
.Em                Bm
    The world goes by

[C
.D           A
 White dove, fly with the wind
.Em                  Bm
 Take our hope under you wings
.        D
 For the world to know
.     A
 That hope will not die
.Em                   Bm
    When the children cry
[

 Waves big like a house
 They're stranded on a piece of wood
 To leave it all behind
 To start again
 But instead of a new life
 All they find is a door that's closed
 And they keep lookin' for
 A place called hope

;chorus

.C                  Bm
 Can anyone tell me why
.             Em
 The children of the world
.        F#
 Have to pay the price

 And now you're telling me
 You've seen it all before
 I know that's right
 But still it breaks my heart
 Well, the golden lamb
 We've sent
 Makes us feel better now
 But you know it's just a drop
 In a sea of tears

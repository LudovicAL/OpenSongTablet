;Intro
.D       E7        G        A          D        E7        G        A7
                                                                   
.D                E7             G         A
 Well, she was an American girl, raised on promises
.D                 E7                        G                   A
 She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life somewhere else
.                   D               G                      Em
 After all it was a great big world with lots of places to run to
.A
 nd if she had to die tryin', she had one little promise she was gonna keep

;Chorus
.G      A        D
 Oh yeh,alright, take it easy baby
.Bm                     G       A           D
 Make it last all night she was an American girl.

.D                   E7               G                      A
 Well it was kind of cold that night, she stood alone on the balcony
.D                       E7                  G                   A
 Yeh, she could hear the cars roll by out on four forty one like waves crashing on the beach,
.                      D            G                    Em
 And for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory
.A
 God it's so painful when something that's so close, is still so far out of reach

;Chorus

;Break

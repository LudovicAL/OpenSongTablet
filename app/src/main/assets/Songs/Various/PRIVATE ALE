.Ab
 I wonder down these streets all by myself
.                                     Db
 Think of my future now, I just don't know
.                Ab
 I don't seem to care
 I stop to notice that I'm by your home
 I wonder if your sitting all alone
 Or is your boyfriend there

.          Db   Ab Eb
 Because I feel so right
 Let my imagination go
 Until your in my sight
 And though my veins temptation flows

.Ab    Gb  Db
           

 So I sit here on the hard concrete
 Think of my future now, I just don't know
 I don't seem to care
 So I sit across the street from your home
 I wonder if your sittng all alone
 Or is your boyfriend there</lyrics>

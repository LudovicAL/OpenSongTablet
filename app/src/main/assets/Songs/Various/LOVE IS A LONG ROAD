[Intro]  B  AE E  DA  B  DA  E  DA

.B                 D  A
  There was a girl in town
.E                D        A
  She said she cared about me
.B                  D  A
  She tried to make my world
.E                   D         A
  The way she tought it should be
.G             D         A
  Yeah we were desperate then
.G              D
  To have each other to hold
.A   B  E      B          E
 But love is a long, long road

 There were so many times
 I would wake up at noon
 With my head spinning 'round
 I would wait for the moon
 And give her one more chance
 To try and save my soul
 But love is a long, long road

 Yeah it was hard to give up
 Some things are hard to let go
 Somethings are never enough
 I guess I only can hope
 For maybe one more chance
 To try and save my soul
 But love is a long, long road</lyrics>

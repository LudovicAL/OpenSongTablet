.E          A              B7      E            A             B7
 Every Day, it's a getting closer. Going faster than a roller coaster.
.E                   A       B7      E   A     E       B7
 Love like yours will surely come my way, a-hay, a-hay-hay.

.E          A              B7      E              A          B7

.E                   A       B7      E   A     E
 Love like yours will surely come my way, a-hay, a-hay-hay.

.A                                D
 Every Day seems a little longer. Every way, loves a little stronger.
.G                                 C             B7
 Come with me. Do you ever long for true love from me?

.E          A              B7      E              A          B7
 Every Day, it's a getting faster. Everyone said "Go out and ask her".
.E                   A      B7       E   A     E       B7
 Love like yours will surely come my way, a-hay, a-hay-hay.

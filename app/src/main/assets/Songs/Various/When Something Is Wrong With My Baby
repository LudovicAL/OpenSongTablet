;intro
.F

.C                      Am
 When something's wrong with my baby
.F                      G
 Something's wrong with me
.    C         Am
 And if I know she don't worry
.F                           G
 Still I would feel the same misery

.Em                         Am
 We've been through so much together
.Em                                      F      F#dim
 We've been as one, that's what makes it better 

;chorus
[C
.     C                          F
 When something is wrong with my baby
.C/G          Dm/F       Dm C
 something is wrong with me 
[

 Just what, ahah, she means to me now
 Oh, you just wouldn't understand, yeah
 Now people try to say she is no good
 But, oh, she's my woman, and I know I'm her man

 If she treats her guy proper
 I know I'm gonna help her suffer

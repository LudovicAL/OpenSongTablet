;THE BOOMTOWN RATS

.    C              G
 The silicon chip inside her head
.     F               G
 Gets switched to overload
.    C                    G
 And nobody's gonna go to school today,
.            F                 G
 She's gonna make them stay at home,
.    Am                 G
 And daddy doesn't understand it,
.          C                    F
 He always said she was good as gold,
.           F
 And he can see no reasons
.          F
 Cos there are no reasons
.     F                        G
 What reason do you need to be shown

[C]
.        C                G
 Tell me why I don't like mondays,
.        F                G
 Tell me why I don't like mondays,
.        C                G
 Tell me why I don't like mondays,
.        F                    G
 I wanna shoo-oo-oo-oo - oo - oot
.N.C.          C
 The whole day down.

.    C                G
 The Telex machine is kept so clean
.       F                  G
 And it types to a waiting world,
.    C
 And Mother feels so shocked
.         G
 Father's world is rocked,
.          F
 And their thoughts turn to
.      G
 Their own little girl.
.Am                       G
 Sweet sixteen ain't that peachy keen,
.       C                  F
 No, it ain't so neat to admit defeat,
.         F
 They can see no reasons
.          F
 Cos there are no reasons
.     F              G
 What reasons do you need

.        C                G
 Tell me why I don't like mondays
.        F                G
 Tell me why I don't like mondays
.        C                G
 Tell me why I don't like mondays
.        F                    G
 I wanna shoo-oo-oo-oo - oo - oot
.N.C.          Am                             F
 The whole day down, down, down, shoot it all down...

.            C                        G
 And all the playing's stopped in the playground now
.    F                      G
 She wants to play with her toys a while,
.    C                      G
 And school's out early and soon we'll be learning
.        F               G
 And the lesson today is how to die.
.             Am
 And then the bullhorn crackles,
.        G
 And the captain tackles,
.         C                          F
 With the problems and the how's and why's
.           F
 And he can see no reasons
.          F
 Cos there are no reasons
.     F                     G
 what reason do you need to die

.        C                G
 Tell me why I don't like mondays
.        F                G
 Tell me why I don't like mondays
.        C                G
 Tell me why I don't like mondays
.        F                    G
 I wanna shoo-oo-oo-oo - oo - oot
.N.C.          C
 The whole day down.</lyrics>

;Marvin Gaye

[V1]
.Emaj7 Emaj7
 Ah, mercy, mercy me,
.C#m7       C#m7                            F#m7
 Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no.
.                 F#m7
 Where did all the blue skies go?
.Amaj7                         Amaj7
 Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east.

[V2]
 Mercy, mercy me,
 Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no.
 Oil wasted on the ocean and upon
 our seas fish full of mercury,

[V3]
 Oh, mercy, mercy me.
 Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no, no.
 Radiation underground and in the sky;
 animals and birds who live near by are dying.

[V4]
 Oh, mercy, mercy me.
 Ah, things ain't what they used to be.
 What about this over crowded land?
 How much more abuse from man can she stand?</lyrics>

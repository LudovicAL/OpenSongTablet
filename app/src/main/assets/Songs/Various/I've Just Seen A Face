;Capo 2nd fret
.G                                                             D/F#    Em
 I've just seen a face I can't for get the time or place where we just met
.                                                                 C
 She's just the girl for me and I want all the world to see we've met
.         D     G
 Na na na na na na

 Had it been another day I might have looked the other way and
 I'd have never been aware but as it is I'll dream of her tonight
 Da da da da da da

;Chorus:
.D                C                     G       D       G
 Falling yes I am falling and she keeps calling me back again

 I have never known the likes of this I've been alone and I have
 Missed things and kept out of sight but as it is I'll dream of her tonight
 Da da da da da da

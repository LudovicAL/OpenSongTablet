.G    Em                     D
 Oh - thinkin' about all our younger years
.          Am           Em
 There was only you and me
.        F                  D
 We were young and wild and free

.G   Em                   D
 Now nothin' can take you away from me
.           Am               Em
 We've been down that road before
.           F         Em
 But that's over now  
.            D
 You keep me comin' back for more

;Chorus
.C            D          Em
 Baby, you're all that I want
.            G                C
 When you're lyin' here in my arms
.    C          D          Em
 I'm findin' it hard to believe
.         D
 We're in heaven

.    C       D          Em
 And love is all that I need
.      G                      C
 And I found it there in your heart
.   C         D       Em
 It isn't too hard to see
.         D
 We're in heaven

.G    Em                         D
 Uh - once in your your life you find someone
.         Am              Em
 Who will turn your world around
.          F                      D
 Brind you up when you're feeling down

.G    Em                            D
 Ya - nothin' could change what you mean to me
.            Am                Em
 Oh, there's lots that I could say
.         F            Em
 But just hold me now  
.           D
 Cause your love will light the way

;Chorus

.Am                       C
 I've been waitin' for so long
.                 Em
 For somethin' to arrive
.                 D
 For love to come along

.Am                        C
 Now our dreams are comin' true
.                               G
 Through the good times and the bad
.             D
 Ya - I'll be standin' there by you

.      G                    Em
 I was late at night on the open road
.G                          C
 Speeding like a man on the run
.  C        G        C     G        D
 A lifetime spent preparing for the journey
.      G                  Em
 He is closer now, as the search is on
.G                         C
 Reading from a map in the mind
.     C            G      C                  G           D
 Yes, there's that rugged hill and there's a boat on the river.
.             Em            Em D
 And when the rain came down,
.             Em          Dsus4 D
 He heard a wild dog howl.
.           C             G
 There were voices in the night. (don't do it)
.C             G
 Voices out of sight. (don't do it)
.C                           B
 "Too many men have failed before; whatever you do,

;CHORUS:
.Em    D       Em
 Don't pay the ferryman
.Em    D    Em    C    D
 Don't even fix a price
.Em    D       Em
 Don't pay the ferryman
.         C               D     Em
 Until he gets you to the other side"

.Em D Em Em D Em

.       G                  Em
 In the rolling mist as he gets on board
.G                              C
 Now there'll be no turning back
.  C         G      C      G       D
 Beware that hooded old man at the rudder
.        G                         Em
 And the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled
.    G                          C
 And people calling out his name
.    C       G          C              G             D
 And dancing bones that jabbered and a-moaned on the water.
.             Em           Em D
 And then the ferryman said
.          Em           Dsus4 D
 "there is trouble ahead
.   C               G
 So you must pay me now" (don't do it)
. C               G
 "You must pay me now" (don't do it)
.C                              B
 And still that voice came from beyond: "whatever you do,

;CHORUS

.Em D Em   Em D Em
                
.B
    Yea....

;CHORUS

;CHORUS

.Em    D        D   Em Em Em
 Don't pay...   The Ferry-man!</lyrics>

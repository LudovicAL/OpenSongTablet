.G                      B
 Sittin' in the morning sun,
.        C                   B   Bb A
 I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come.
.G                       B
 Watchin' the ships roll in,
.       C                   BBb A
 then I watch 'em roll away a gain

.          C                          E9
 Yeah, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay,
.E                G      E9
 Watchin' the tide roll away.
.     E                                   A
 Ooh, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay,
.        G
 wastin' time.

 I left my home in Georgia,
 headed for the Frisco bay.
 I have nothin' to live for,
 look like nothin's gonna come my way.

 So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay,
 Watchin' the tide roll away.
 Ooh, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay,
 wastin' time.

.G      D    C
  Looks like  nothin's gonna change;
.G  D       C
  everything still remains the same.
.GD          C
  I can't do what ten people tell me to do,
.F                      D
  so I guess I'll remain the same.

 Sittin' here restin' my bones,
 and this loneliness won't leave me alone.
 Two thousand miles I roam
 just to make this dock my home

 Now I'm gonna sit at the dock of the bay,
 Watchin' the tide roll away.
 Ooh, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay,
 wastin' time.

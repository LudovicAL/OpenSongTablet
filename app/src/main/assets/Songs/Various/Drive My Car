.Am7                   D            Am7                D
 Asked a girl what she wanted to be and she said baby, can't you see
.Am7                    D                  Em                          Em7+
 I want to be famous, a star on the screen but you can do something in between

;Chorus
.F#m7                  Am7      Bm7      Cm7      Bm7      Am7
 Baby you can drive my car                                 
.F#m7               Am7      Bm7      Cm7      Bm7      Am7
 Yes I'm gonna be a star                                
.F#m7                  Am7     Bm7     Em7+
 Baby you can drive my car and maybe I love you

.Am7                      D                   Am7                     D
 I told that girl that my prospects were good and she said baby, it's understood
.Am7                    D             Em                   Em7+
 Working for peanuts is all very fine but I can show you a better time

;Chorus

;Solo over verse

;Chorus

.Am7                           D                Am7                               D
 I told that girl that I could start right away and she said listen babe I've got something to say
.Am7                   D                 Em             Em7        Em7+
 I got no car and it's breakin' my heart but I've got a driver and that's a start

.      E7                   C#7
 I call your name but you're not there
.   F#7                B7
 Was I to blame for being unfair
.             E7                               C#7
 Oh I can't sleep at night since you've been gone
.  F#7           A
 I never weep at night, I can't go on

.                        A
 Don't you know I can't take it
.    C#m
 I don't know who can
.    F#
 I'm not going to make it
.       C B7
 I'm not that kind of man.

 Oh I can't sleep at night but just the same
 I ever weep at night I call your name.</lyrics>

.F                                             Bb
 Before we met there must have been some other 
.F                                    Bb
 Like story book and fairy tale lover 
.C
 But in my life there's never been another
.             F
 So perfect lover

[C
.F            Bb
 Oh-ho darling
.Bb            F
 Now that I found you
.F               Bb                         F
 It's like a missing piece of puzzle has appeared
.F             Bb
 And now my darling
.Bb          F
 My love surrounds you
.F               Bb
 And since you came into my life my love
.Bb                            F
 Perfection's never ever been so near
[

.F                                      Bb
 To love and to be loved is so inspiring
.F
 And that's why every lover's so desiring
.C
 Oh for love that seek and never tiring
.F
 Always inspiring

 Love like just like moon like glowing
.Bb                 F
 Our love keeps growing

;chorus

.Bb              C               F
 Lying here with you in the night
.Bb             C           F
 Underneath the heavenly sky
.Bb              C          F
 Baby what a beautiful sight
.F                  Bb
 Are you my darling?
.F            Bb
 Hold me tight

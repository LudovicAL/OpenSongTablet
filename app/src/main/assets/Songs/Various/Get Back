.A
 Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner,
.D                       A    G  D
 But he knew it couldn't last.   
.A
 Jojo left his home in Tuscon, Arizona
.D                   A     G  D
 For some California grass    

;Chorus
.A
 Get back,  get back
.D                        A      G  D
 Back to where you once belonged    
.A
 Get back,  get back
.D
 Back to where you once belonged - Get back Jo!

;Electric Piano solo - same chords as verse

;Chorus

 Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman,
 But she was another man.
 All the girls around her said she's got it comin',
 But she gets it while she can.

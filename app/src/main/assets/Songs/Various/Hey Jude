 Take a sad song and make it better.

 Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.

 For now you know that it's a fool who plays it cool

 By makeing his world a little colder.

 You have found her, now go and get her.

 Your waiting for someone to perform with
.F7                               Bb                    Gm7
 And don't you know that its just you, hey Jude, you'll do
.                 C7              F
 The movement you need is on your shoulder.

 Take a sad song and make it better.

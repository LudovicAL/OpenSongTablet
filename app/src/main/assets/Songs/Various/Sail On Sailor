;verse 1:
.G                 C/G G              C/G
 I sailed an ocean,    unsettled ocean
.G                     C/G G
 Through restful waters    and deep commotion
.Ebmaj9 Am7/D     Ebmaj9  Am7/D
 Often frightened,    unenlightened
.Ebmaj7     F        G
 Sail on, sail on sailor

;verse 2:
 I wrest the waters, fight Neptune's waters
 Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
 Unrepenting, often empty
 Sail on, sail on sailor

;pre-bridge:
.D                 D#dim  Em
 Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail
.D                      D#dim  Em
 Bought like a crust of bread, oh do I wail

;bridge 1:
.       Am7 Em         Am7 Em
 Seldom stumble, never crumble
.       Am7 Em           Am7 Em
 Try to tumble, life's a rumble
.          G   Am7           G  Am7
 Feel the stinging I've been given
.      G  Am7       G   C
 Never ending, unrelenting
.           Am7 Em          Am7 Em
 Heartbreak searing, always fearing
.      Am7 Em       Am7 Em
 Never caring, persevering
.Ebmaj7    F        G
 Sail on, sail on, sailor

;verse 3:
 I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
 Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
 Uninspired, drenched and tired
 Sail on, wail on, sailor

;bridge 2:
 Always needing, even bleeding
 Never feeding all my feelings
 Damn the thunder, must I blunder
 There's no wonder all I'm under
 Stop the crying and the lying
 And the sighing and my dying

 Sail on, sail on sailor (repeat to fade)</lyrics>

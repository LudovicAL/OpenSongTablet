;Intro:

;Verse:
. C               F           C            F
 I'm the kind of guy    who never used to cry
.      F                   G       C      A
 The world is treating me bad    misery   
.      C                F         C                F
 I've lost her now for sure    I won't see her no more
.       F         G           C
 It's gonna be a drag       misery

;Middle:
. Am                            C
 I'll remember all the little things she's done

.  Am                                 G            G7
 She'll remember and she'll miss her only one   lonely one

;Verse:
. C               F           C           F
 Send her back to me   'Cos everyone can see
.   F               G         C
 Without her I will be   in misery

;Repeat from middle

;Ending:
.   F               G        C      Am
 Without her I will be   in misery (oh)
.     C     Am                    C       Am
 My misery (la la la la la la)   misery</lyrics>

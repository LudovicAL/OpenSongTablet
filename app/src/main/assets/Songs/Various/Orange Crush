;intro:
.Em    G       D
               
.Em
 Follow me don't follow me
.       G                 D
 I've got my spine I've got my orange crush
.  Em
 Collar me don't collar me
.       G                 D
 I've got my spine I've got my orange crush
.  Em            G
 We are agents of the free
.        D
 I've had my fun and now its time to
.  Em
 Spread your conscience overseas
.  G              D
 Coming in fast over me

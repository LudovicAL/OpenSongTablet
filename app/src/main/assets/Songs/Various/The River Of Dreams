.                     G
 In the middle of the night
.                   G
 I go walking in my sleep
.                      C
 From the mountains of faith
.              D
 To a river so deep
.                      G
 I must be looking for something
.                    G
 Something sacred I lost
.                 C
 But the river is wide
.                      D
 And it's too hard to cross

 Refrain: (strum each chord for a half-note duration)
.Em                         D
 And even though I know the river is wide
.            C                    Bm7
 I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
.C                        Bm7
 And try to cross to the opposite side
.         A7                           D            N.C.
 So I can finally find what I've been searching for 

 In the middle of the night
 I go walking in my sleep
 Through the valley of fear
 To a river so deep
 And I've been serching for something
 Taken out of my soul
 Something I would never lose
 Something somebody stole

 Refrain (repeat refrain chords):
 I don't know why I go walking at night
 But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
 I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
 Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

 In the middle of the night
 I go walking in my sleep
 Through the jungle of doubt
 To a river so deep
 I know I'm searching for something
 Something so undefined
 That it can only be seen
 By the eyes of the blind
 In the middle of the night

 Refrain:
 I'm not sure about a life after this
 God knows I've never been a spiritual man
 Baptized by the fire, I wade into
 The river that runs to the promised land

 In the middle of the night
 I go walking in my sleep
 Through the desert of truth
 To the river so deep
 We all end up in the ocean
 We all start in the streams
 We're all carried along
 By the river of dreams
 In the middle of the night

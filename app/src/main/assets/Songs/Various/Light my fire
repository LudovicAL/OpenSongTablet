.    Dm7                     Bm7
 You know that it would be untrue
.    Dm7                    Bm7
 you know that I would be a liar
.Dm7                Bm7
 if I was to say to you
.Dm7                        Bm7
 girl, we couldn't get much higher

.C            D        G    Em
 Come on baby light my fire 
.C            D        G    Em
 come on baby light my fire 
.C              G        A
 try to set the night on  fire

 The time to hesitate is through
 no time to wallow in the mire
 try now we can only loose
 And our love become a funeral pyre

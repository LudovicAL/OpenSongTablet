;Verse 1:
.E              C#
 You can dance, you can jive
.F#m7                    B7
 having the time of your life.
.    D              Bm7
 Oh, see that girl, watch that scene,
.            A
 Diggin' the dancing queen.
.A                                       D
 Friday night and the lights are low.    
.A                                F#m7
 Looking out for a place to go.   
.E                         Esus4
 Where they play the right music
.E              Esus4
 Getting in the swing.
.                E    F#m7
 You've  come to look for a king.
.A                     D
 Anybody could be that guy.
.A                              F#m7
 Night is young and the music's high.
.E                  Esus4
 With a bit of rock music
.E             Esus4
 Everything is fine,
.              E    F#m7
 You're in the mood for a dance.
.                     Bm7     E
 And when you get the chance...

;Chorus:
.            A              D                     A             D
 You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen.    
.A              D                      Amaj9 A
 Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tam - bourine.
.Amaj9 D   A
 Oh    yeah.
.E              C#m7
 You can dance, you can jive
.F#m7                    B7
 having the time of your life.
.    D              Bm7
 Oh, see that girl, watch that scene,
.            A
 Diggin' the dancing queen.

;Verse 2:
 You're a tease, you turn 'em on.
 Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
 Looking out for another, Anyone will do,
 You're in the mood for a dance.
 And when you get the chance...</lyrics>

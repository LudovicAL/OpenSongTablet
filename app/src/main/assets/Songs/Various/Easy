.Ab               Cm7                    Bbm7            Bbm7/Eb
 I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain  
.Ab       Cm7            Bbm7    Bbm7/Eb
 Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow   
.Ab          Cm7                      Bbm7         Bbm7/Eb
 It seems to me girl, you know I done all I can    
.Ab           Cm7              Bbm7         Bbm7/Eb
 You see, you beg, stole and I borrowed

.                Ab               Cm7           Bbm7
 That's why I'm easy,    (aaaah, aaaah, aaaah, aaaah)
.    Bbm7/Eb          Gb    Db
 I'm easy like sunday morning.
.                Ab               Cm7           Bbm7
 That's why I'm easy,    (aaaah, aaaah, aaaah, aaaah)
.    Bbm7/Eb          Gb    Db
 I'm easy like sunday morning.

 I wanna be high, so high
.           Gbmaj7            Fm7            Ebm7
 I wanna be preaching all the things I do allright.
.           Gbmaj7Fm7  Ebm7
 I wanna be free, just me

;A bunch of people were requesting this after EC's VH1 rehearsal show.
;This is actually an older version -- EC changed around a bunch of the
;lyrics and the structure a little bit, and I think I actually prefer the
;original.  His take is also half a step off of this (though I can't
;remember if his is higher or lower).
;Share and enjoy, as always.

.Bb                   D7         Gm                 D7
  There ain't nothin'  I can do,  nor nothin' I can  say,
.G7                Dm7 G7Cm   G7
  That folks don't  criticize  me.
.Cm             G7            Cm          C
  But I'm gonna  do just as I  want to anyway,
.C7                           F#7  F7
  I don't care if they all despise  me.

.Bb           D7
  If I should  take a notion
.Gm         Eb
  To jump into the ocean,
.Bb                 F7             Bb   G7 C7 F7
  It ain't nobody's  business if I  do.   

.Bb           D7
  Rather than  persecute me,
.Gm             Eb
  I choose that  you would shoot me,
.Bb                 F7             Bb   G7 C7 F7
  It ain't nobody's  business if I  do.   

.Bb           D7
  If I should  get the feelin'
.Gm          Eb
  To dance upon the ceiling',
.Bb                 F7             Bb   G7 C7 F7
  It ain't nobody's  business if I  do.   

.Bb           D7
  If I let my  best companion
.Gm                Eb
  Drive me right into the canyon,
.Bb                 F7             Bb   G7 C7 F7
  It ain't nobody's  business if I  do.   

.Bb             D7         Gm                 D7
  After all the  way to do  is do just as you  please,
.G7          Dm7 G7     Cm   G7
  Regardless  of  their  talkin'
.Cm               G7                       Cm             C
  Often times the  ones that talk will get  down on their  knees,
.C7                             F#7   F7
  And beg your pardon for their  squakin'. (sp?)

.Bb       D7
  If I dislike my lover
.Gm                   Eb
  And leave (him/her)  for another,
.Bb                 F7             Bb   G7 C7 F7
  It ain't nobody's  business if I  do.   

.Bb          D7
  If I go to  church on Sunday,
.Gm        Eb
  Then cabaret on Monday,
.Bb                 F7             Bb   G7 C7 F7
  It ain't nobody's  business if I  do.   

.Bb                  D7
  If my friend ain't  got no money
.Gm                Eb
  And I say, "Take  all mine honey,"
.Bb                 F7             Bb   G7 C7 F7
  It ain't nobody's  business if I  do.   

.Bb                   D7
  If I lend (him/her)  my last nickel
.Gm                Eb
  And it leaves me  in a pickle,
.Bb                 F7             Bb
  It ain't nobody's  business if I  do.

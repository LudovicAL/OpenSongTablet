.G
 Just about a year ago
.  C              G
 I set out on the road
.           G/F#     Em
 Seekin' my fame and fortune
.    Am                   D
 And lookin' for a pot of gold
.G                   Em
 Things got bad, and things got worse
.  C                  G
 I guess you know the tune
.          D              C   G
 Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again

 I rode in on a Greyhound,
 I'll be walkin' out if I go
 I was just passin' through
 Must be seven months or more
 Ran out of time and money
 Looks like they took my friends
 Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again

 The man from the magazine
 Said I was on my way
 Somewhere I lost connection
 Ran out of songs to play
 I came into town on a one-night stand
 Looks like my plans fell through
 Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again

 If I only had a dollar
 For every song I've sung
 And every time I've had to play
 While people sat there drunk
 You know I'd catch the next train
 Back to where I live
 Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again</lyrics>

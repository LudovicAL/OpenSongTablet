;Verse 1
.                   G
 Riding along in my automobile
 My baby beside me at the wheel
.                                C
 I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
.                     G
 my curiosity running wild
.                         D
 crusin' and playin' the radio
.                            G
 with no particular place to go

;Verse 2
.                   G
 Riding along in my automobile
 I's anxious to tell her the way I feel
.                         C
 So I told her softly and sincere
.                                   G
 and she leaned and whispered in my ear
.                          D
 cuddlin' more and drivin' slow
.                            G
 with no particular place to go

;Verse 3
.                       G
 No particular place to go
 So we parked way out on ko-ko-mo
.                                     C
 The night was young and the moon was gold
.                             G
 So we both decided to take a stroll
.                         D
 Can you image the way I felt
.                               G
 I couldn't unfasten her safety belt

;Verse 4
.                   G
 Riding along in my calaboose
 Still trying to get her belt a-loose
.                          C
 all the way home I held a grudge
.                                   G
 for the safety belt that wouldn't budge
.                         D
 Crusin' and playing the radio
.                            G
 with no particular place to go</lyrics>

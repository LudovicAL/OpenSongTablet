;chorus
[C
. Em
 Man gave name to all the animals,
.          B                   Em
 In the beg inning, in the beginning.
 Man gave name to all the animals,
.          B                   Em
 In the beginning, long time ago.
[

.    Em                           B
 He saw an animal that liked to growl,
.                               Em
 Big fury paws and he liked to howl.
.                              A
 Great big fury back and fury hair,
.B                            Em
 Ah, ' think I'll call it a bear.

;chorus

 He saw an animal up on the hill,
 Chewing up so much grass until she was filled.
 He saw milk coming out,
 But he didn't know how,
 Ah, ' think I'll call it a cow.

;chorus

 He saw an animal that liked to snort,
 Horns on his head and they weren't too short,
 It looked like there was nothin' that he couldn't pull,
 Ah, ' think I'll call it a bull.

;chorus

 He saw an animal leavin' a muddy trail,
 Real dirty face and a curly tail,
 He wasn't too small, and he wasn't too big,
 Ah, ' think I'll call it a pig.

;chorus

 Next animal that he did meet,
 Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
 Eating grass on a mountain side so steep,
 Ah, ' think I'll call it a sheep.

;chorus

 He saw an animal as smooth as glass,
 Slithering his way through the grass,
 Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake,
 Ah, ' think I'll call it a snake.

;Intro:

;Verse:
.E  F#m  G#m  F#m                              E
 I  love you        'cos you tell me things I want to know
. E  F#m  G#m  F#m                       E           G#7
 And it's true      that it really only goes to show that I know
.     C#m              A                F#m   B
 That I I I I  would never ever ever be blue  
. E  F#m    G#m  F#m                      E
 Now you're mine      my happiness near makes me cry
. E  F#m G#m  F#m                            E        G#7
 And in  time        you'll understand the reason why that I cry
.     C#m
 It's not because I'm sad
.                A                        E     E+
 But you're the only love that I've ever had    

;Middle:
.         A      B7                 E    E
 I can't believe   it's happened to me   
.          A     B7               E      B
 I can't conceive   of any more misery   

;Verse:
. E  F#m G#m              F#m
 Ask me  why   I'll say I love you
.         G#m                A    E E
 And I'm always thinking of you     

;Repeat from the middle

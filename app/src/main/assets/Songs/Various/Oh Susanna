.       Amaj7     Bm7   C#m7    F#m7    A     F#m7   Bm7
 Well I come from Ala   bama    with a  banjo on my  knee
.        Amaj7     Bm7    C#m7    F#m7   Bm7    Bm7/E   A9
 And I'm bound for Louis  iana,   my own true   love to see
.   Amaj7        Bm7       Cmaj7    F#m7
 It did rain all night the day    I left
.    A       F#m7     Bm7
 The weather was bone dry
.    Amaj7      Bm7   C#m7     F#m7
 The sun was so hot I froze    myself
.   Bm7  Bm7/E     A9
 Suzanna don't you cry

;Chorus
.       Dmaj7   Bm7      Bm7/E
 I said Oh   Suzanna     
.    A         F#m7    Bm7
 Now don't you cry for me
.       Amaj7     Bm7   C#m7    F#m7    A     F#m7   Bm7
 Well I come from Ala   bama    with a  banjo on my  knee

.       Amaj7        Bm7   C#m7   F#m7
 Well I had myself a dream last   night
.     A    F#m7      Bm7
 When everything was still
.  Amaj7          Bm7    C#m7    F#m7
 I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
.        Bm7    Bm7/E      A9
 She was coming around the hill
.    Amaj7     Bm7      C#m7   F#m7
 The buckwheat cake was in her mouth
.  A        F#m7   Bm7
 A tear was in her eye
.  Amaj7    Bm7       C#m7  F#m7
 I said I'd come from Dixie land
.  Bm7   Bm7/E     A9
 Suzanna don't you cry

;Chorus
.       Dmaj7   Bm7      Bm7/E
 I said Oh   Suzanna     
.    A         F#m7    Bm7
 Now don't you cry for me
.       Amaj7     Bm7   C#m7    F#m7    A     F#m7   Bm7
 Well I come from Ala   bama    with a  banjo on my  knee</lyrics>

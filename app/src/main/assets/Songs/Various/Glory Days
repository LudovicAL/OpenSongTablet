 INTRO: A / D A   D / G D   A / D A   D / G A...

.A                         D              A              D
 I had a friend was a big baseball player back in high school
.A                    D                  A                    D
 He could throw that speed ball by you, make you look like a fool boy
.E                                                           D
 Saw him the other night at this roadside bar, I was walkin' in he was
.                        E                                           D
 walkin' out. We went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks, but all he
.                E
 kept talkin' about
.       A                  D                  A
 Glory Days, well they'll pass you by, Glory Days, in
.                D                      A            E
 the wink of a young girls eye Glory Days, Glory Days.

 BRIDGE: E / A E   E / A E   D / G D E

 Additional lyrics

 There's a girl that lives block back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
 Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by and have a few drinks after she put' her kids to bed
 Her and her husband Bobby well they split up I guess it's two years gone by now
 We just sit around talking about the old times she says when she feels like crying
 she stars laughing thinking about
 Glory days ...

 Think I'm going down to the well tonight and I'm going to drink til I get my fill
 And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it, but I probably will
 Yeah just sitting back trying to racapture a little of the glory of
 But time slips away and leaves you with nothing mister
 but boring stories of
 Glory days ...

 All right boys keep it rocking now
 We gonna go home now
 Let's go

 Glory days ...</lyrics>

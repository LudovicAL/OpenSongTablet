.D F#   B       G      Bb      C        A              C     D
 I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends, they're in my head
.F#     B        G    Bb       C       A     C     D
 I'm so ugly, that's ok, cause so are you, broken mirrors
 Sunday morning, 'cause everyday for all I care and I'm not scared
 Light my candles in a daze 'cause I found god

 Yeaah - yeaaaeeeah

 I'm so lonely, that's ok, I shaved my head and I'm not sad
 And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard and I'm not sure
 I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there and I dont' care
 I'm so horny, that's ok, my will is good

 Yeaah - yeaaaeeeah

 I like it I'm not gonna crack
.  Bb       G         Bb    G
 I miss you I'm not gonna crack
 I love you I'm not gonna crack
 I killed you I'm not gonna crack
 I like it I'm not gonna crack
 I miss you I'm not gonna crack
 I love you I'm not gonna crack
.                           C     A  D
 I killed you I'm not gonna crack

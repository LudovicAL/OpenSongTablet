;intro (spoken)
.Em   G   A
          

.Em                      G
 A man decides after seventy years
.             A
 That what he goes there for, is to unlock the door
.Em                      G                        A
 While those around him criticize and sleep       

.Em                              G
 And through a fractal on a breaking wall
.A
 I see you my friend, and touch your face again
.Em                   G
 Miracles will happen as we dream

;chorus
[C]
.C                      G         D                    A
  But we're never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy
.C                         G        D                     A
  Though we're never gonna survive unless we are a little crazy
[]

 All the people walking through my head
 One of them's got a gun to shoot the other one
 And yet together they were friends at school  (- dadum dadum ....)

 But of four were there when we first took the pill
 They'll be back, be back, baby
 Miracles will happen as we sleep

;chorus
 No no, never survive, unless we get a little, babe

;drumbreak

 Oh darling...
.     C                        G                            D
 In a sky full of people, only some want to fly, isn't that crazy?
.     C                          G                            D
 In a world full of people, only some want to fly, isn't that crazy? crazy?
.     C                              G                            D
 In a heaven of people, there's only some want to fly, isn't that crazy? Oh, babe
.     C                                  G                            D
 In a world full of people, there's only some want to fly, isn't that crazy?
.                                                           A
 (isn't that crazy?) isn't that crazy? (isn't that crazy?)

.           G                 Em               G              D7
 If there's anything that you want; if there's anything I can do,
.     C7                  Em                   C       D7    G
 just call on me and I'll send it along with love from me to you.

.           G                 Em           G                    D7
 If there's anything that you want, like a heart that's, oh, so true,
.     C7                  Em                   C       D7    G
 just call on me and I'll send it along with love from me to you.

.      Dm7               G7           C
 I got arms that long to hold you and keep you by my side.
.      Em7               A7           D7       D7+
 I got lips that long to kiss you and keep you satisfied.

.           G                 Em               G              D7
 If there's anything that you want; if there's anything I can do,
.     C7                  Em                   C       D7    G
 just call on me and I'll send it along with love from me to you.

.      Dm   F        G   Bb
 There is a house in New Orleans they
.Dm       F      A7  A7/E
 call the Rising Sun and its
.Dm       F       G         Bb
 been the ruin of many poor girl, and
.Dm     A7       Dm
 me, oh God, for one.

 If I had listened to what my mother said,
 I'd hve been at home today,
 But I was young and folish, oh God,
 Let a rambler lead me astray.

 Go tell my baby sister,
 Don't do what I have done
 But shun that house in New Orleans
 They call the Rising Sun

 I'm goin' back to New Orleans
 My race is almost run,
 I'm goin' back to spend my life
 Beneath that Rising Sun</lyrics>

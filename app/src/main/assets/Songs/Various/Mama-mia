;Verse 1:
.D         A          D           A          G
 I've been cheated by you since I don't know when.
.D    A          D            A          G
 So I made up my mind it must come to an end.

.D    Lick#1    Dmin#5
 Look at me now,  will I ever learn?
.D  Lick#2    Dmin#5               G
 I don't know   how but I suddenly lose control.
.               A
 There's a fire within my soul.
.G    D   A
 Just one look and I can hear a bell ring,
.G   D    A
 One more look and I forget everything, oooh.

;Chorus:
.D
 Mama mia, here I go again.
.C  G             D
 My my, how can I resist you?
.D
 Mama mia, does it show again?
.C  G                      D
 My my, just how much I've missed you.
.D  Lick#3      A
 Yes, I've been brokenhearted.
.Bmin           F#min
 Blue since the day we parted.
.C   G   Emin       A
 Why why did I ever let you go.
.D  Lick#4   Bmin
 Mama mia,    now I really know,
.C  G   Emin          A
 My my, I could never let you go.

;Verse 2:
 I've been angry and sad about the things that you do.
 I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through.
 And when you go, when you slam the door,
 I think you know that you won't be away too long,
 You know that I'm not that strong.
 Just one look and I can hear a bell ring,
 One more look and I forget everything, oooh.

 Mama mia, here I go again.
 My my, how can I resist you?
 Mama mia, does it show again?
 My my, just how much I've missed you.
 Yes, I've been brokenhearted,
 blue since the day we parted.
 Why, why did I ever let you go.
 Mama mia, even if I say
 bye bye, leave me now or never,
 Mama mia, it's a game we play.
 Bye bye doesn't mean forever.

 Mama mia, here I go again.
 My my, how can I resist you?
 Mama mia, does it show again?
 My my, just how much I've missed you.
 Yes, I've been brokenhearted,
 blue since the day we parted.
 Why, why did I ever let you go.
 Mama mia, now I really know,
 my my, I could never let you go.</lyrics>

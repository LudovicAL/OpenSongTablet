.E     E                    Cmaj7     D           E
 There used to be a graving time all alone on the sea
.E     E        Cmaj7        D            E
 You became the light on the dark side of me
.E      E       Cmaj7        D                  E
 Love remains a drug gets me high, that's how I feel
.        E                 Em       Cmaj7         D
 Did you know that when it snows my eyes become enlarged
.        Cmaj7          D            E      E
 And the light that you shine can be seen

.  E                      Cmaj7       D           E
 Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grave
.    E                     Cmaj7       D        E
 The more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
.E             C          D        C              D            E      E
 Now that your rose is in bloom, a light hits the gloom on the grave

 There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
 You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby
 To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
 Won't you tell me is that healthy, babe?
 But did you know that when it snows, my eyes become enlarged
 And the light that you shine can be seen

;interlude
.D    D    Am          G           D
 I've been kissed by a rose on the grave,
. D        Am          G
 I've been kissed by a rose
.D    D    Am          G           D
 I've been kissed by a rose on the grave
. D        Am          G           E
 I've been kissed by a rose on the grave

 There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
 You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
 To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
 Won't you tell me is that healthy, babe
 But did you know, that when it snows, my eyes become enlarged
 And the light that you shine can be seen

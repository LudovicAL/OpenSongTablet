.                        A
 You ain't nothing but a hound dog been snoopin' 'round my door
.A7                      D                                 A
 You ain't nothing but a hound dog been snoopin' 'round my door
.        E                   D7                      A
 You can wag your tail but I ain't gonna feed you no more

;Chorus
.                    A7                                  A
 You told me you was high class well I could see through that
.                    D7                                  A
 You told me you was high class well I could see through that
.           E    D                     A
 And baby I know You ain't a real cool cat

;Repeat 1st verse

;Solo

 You made me feel so blue You made me weep and moan
 You made me feel so blue You made me weep and moan
 'Cause I'm looking for a woman All you're looking for is a home

;Repeat 1st verse

;End with barking and stuff</lyrics>

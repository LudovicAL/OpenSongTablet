 I will   say the only words I know that you'll understand.

;Chorus

 I need you, I need you, I need you, I need to make you see
 oh what you mean to me
 until I do I'm hoping you will know what I mean

;Chorus

 I want you, I want you, I want you, I think you know by now
 I'll get to you somehow
 until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand

 Michelle, ma belle sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble, tres bien ensemble

.       Bm                             Em          F#
 I will say the only words I know that you'll understand,

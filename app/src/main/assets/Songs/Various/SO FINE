[Intro] E C G D A  (repeat)

. E    A               E      A
 Two drifters on the morning sky,
. E    A               E        F#m
 Two drifters sailing wide and high,
. E           F#m            G#m       F#m
 When summer breezes blow across your mind,
.       E  F#m             B9    B
 With you, I will walk the line. 

;CHORUS
.          C#m      F#m
 I want it so fine  
.          C#m      F#m
 I want it so fine  
.          C#m      F#m Am E C G D A
 I want it so fine              

 People walking hand in hand,
 Everybody's singing to the band,
 I want to be where the stars shine bright,
 And hear sweet music on a summer night.

;CHORUS

 Sundowners we'll go on and on,
 We'll find the land of the midnight sun,
 And when you look you'll see for miles around,
 You'll see, the world is in your hand.

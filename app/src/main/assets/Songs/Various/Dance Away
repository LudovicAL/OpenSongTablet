. D#                     Cm
 Yesterday - well it seemed so cool
.         G#                A#
 When I walked you home, kissed goodnight
. G#                      A#
 I said "it's love" you said "all right"
. D#                      Cm
 It's funny how I could never cry
. G#                 A#
 Until tonight and you pass by
. G#                 A#
 Hand in hand with another guy
. G#                          A#
 You're dressed to kill and guess who's dying?

. F              Dm
 Dance away the heartache
. A#              C       F         Dm
 Dance away the tears - Dance away  

 Loneliness is a crowded room
 Full of open hearts turned to stone
 All together all alone
 All at once my whole world had changed
 Now I'm in the dark, off the wall
 Let the strobe light up them all
 I close my eyes and dance till dawn

 Dance away -

 Now I know I must walk the line
 Until I find an open door
 Off the street onto the floor
 There was I - many times a fool
 I hope and pray, but not too much
 Out of reach is out of touch
 All the way is far enough

 Dance away -</lyrics>

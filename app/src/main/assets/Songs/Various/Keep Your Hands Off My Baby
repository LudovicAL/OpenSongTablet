    We've been friends for oh so long.

    I let you share what's mine.

    When you mess with the girl I love
.     G
 It's time to draw the line.

.          G                              Em
 Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby.
.                C                     D7
 I ain't'a gonna tell you but one more time.
.               G                              Em
 Woh, keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby.
.                C                D7              G    C G
 Boy, you get it through your head - that girl is mine.
[

 I don't mind if you lend my clothes.
 But you will be in touch.
 There is somethin' that you get straight.
 There's one thing you don't touch.

[C
 Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby.
 I ain't'a gonna tell you but one more time.
 Woh, keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby.
 Can you get it through your head ? - that girl is mine.

 Keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby.
 I ain't'a gonna tell you but one more time.
 Woh, keep your hands (keep your hands) off my baby.
 Can you get it through your head ? - that girl is mine.

 (Keep your hands off my baby)  You better watch yourself now.

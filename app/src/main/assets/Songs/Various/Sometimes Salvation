;Intro:
.Gb Ab Bb B
          
.A Abmin A
         

;Verse:
.B            A
 To lessen my troubles
.                           Abmin
 I stopped hanging out with vultures
.                    A
 And empty saviours like you
.B              A                Abmin
 I wish I had a nickel for every miracle
.                        F#
 That you easily tricked me into

;Chorus:
.E       Eb Db B
 You can lead a horse to water
.Abmin       E             E Eb Db B
 But fate is another matter        
.B                Abmin
 So don't you surrender
.      E
 Cause sometimes salvation
.        F#     E Eb Db
 In the eye of the storm
.F#                    E     Eb  Db   B
 Sister do you want to try and find me

 I've no time for accusations
 Or conversations
 On all the bad, bad things that you do
 Just a note from the jailer
 Drugs and the relation
 To all the people around you

;Chorus
;Solo
.B                            A
 I've kept secret your superstitions
.             Abmin
 And all its twisted wisdom
.        F#
 That I fell into

;Chorus

 Sister do you even want to try and find me?</lyrics>

;intro: strum (x2)
.D A/D  Dsus DA/D G/DD(9) D
                       
.F    F(9)  F    Fmaj7  A    A7   A+   A
 Run, run,  run, run,   run, run, run, run
.D
 Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

.          E
 You better make your face up in your favourite disguise
.          F
 With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
.          E
 With your empty smile and your hungry heart
.         C
 Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
.          B7
 With your nerves in tatters, when the cockleshell shatters
.        E
 And the hammers batter down your door
.           D
 You better run

;introstrum

.F    F(9)  F    Fmaj7  A    A7   A+   A
 Run, run,  run, run,   run, run, run, run
.D
 Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

.          E
 You better run all day and run all night
.              F
 And keep your dirty feelings deep inside.
.              E
 And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight,
.           C
 You better park the car well out of sight
.             B7
 'Cos if they catch you in the backseat trying to pick her locks
.              E
 They're gonna send you back to mother in a cardboard box
.           D
 You better run.

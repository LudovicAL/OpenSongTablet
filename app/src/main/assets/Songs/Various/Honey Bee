. A
 Come on now, give me some sugar
 Give me some sugar, little honey bee
 Don't be afraid, not gonna hurt you
 I wouldn't hurt my little honey bee

. A
 Don't say a word, `bout what we're doin'
 Don't say nothin' little honey bee
 Don't tell your momma, don't tell your sister
 Don't tell your boyfriend, little honey bee

;Chorus

. A                        C
 She like to call me king bee
.                            D
 She like to buzz `round my tree
.              F
 I call her honey bee
. A              C
 I'm a man in a trance
.                    D
 I'm a boy in short pants
.                 F
 When I see my honey bee
.       F7
 and I've got something to say

;repeat intro 4x, guitar solo

. A
 Look here now, peace in the valley
 Peace in the valley with my honey bee
 Don't say a word, `bout what we're doin'
 Don't say nothin' little honey bee

;Chorus
. A                      C
 She give me her monkey hand
.                 D
 And a Rambler sedan
.                 F
 I'm the king of Milwaukee
. A                     C
 Her juju beads are so nice
.                            D
 She kissed my third cousin twice
.                    F
 I'm the king of Pomona
.       F7
 And I've got something to say

.D         E7             G      A7
 It is the evening of the day... 
.D         E7                 G       A7
 I sit and watch the children play... 
.G             A7         D           Bm
 Smiling faces I can see, but not for me
.G                  F#m   Em7A7
 I sit and watch as tears go by

.D         E7             G        A7
 My riches can't buy ev'rything... 
.D         E7                G       A7
 I want to hear the children sing... 
.G          A7           D               Bm
 All I hear is the sound of rain falling on the ground
.G                  F#m   Em7A7
 I sit and watch as tears go by

.D         E7             G      A7
 It is the evening of the day... 
.D         E7                 G       A7
 I sit and watch the children play... 
.G              A7         D              Bm
 Doin' things I used to do they think are new
.G                  F#m   Em7A7
 I sit and watch as tears go by

.D        E7 G A7
 Mmmm ...   
.D        E7 G A7 Em7 A7
 Mmmm ...</lyrics>

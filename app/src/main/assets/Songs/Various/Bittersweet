.Gm                     F
 On the one side truth towers like a cliff
.       Eb                      Gm
 On the other side love dangles by a thread
. Gm                   F
 Here is a climber he cannot find his eyes
.       Eb                       Gm
 And a falling woman wishing she was dead
.     D                   D/C
 Ooh both sides why is it always bittersweet
.         Bm                                 D
 And the broken cloudy days when I need the sun's heat
.   Gm                                  F
 I need the heat oh both ways why is it always bittersweet
.         Eb                                 Gm
 And the broken cloudy days when I need the sun's heat
.      Gm                                 F
 Oh I need the heat why why is it bittersweet
.            Eb                              Gm
 And the broken cloudy days when I need the sun's heat
.      Gm
 Oh I need the heat, oh, ooh, ooh</lyrics>

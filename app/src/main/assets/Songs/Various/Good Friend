.           G                                                G7
 When you got a good friend that will stay right by your side
.           C                                                G G7
 When you got a good friend that will stay right by your side  
.D                                      C                  G
 Give her all your spare time, try to love and treat her right

.                                               G7
 I mistreated my baby, I can't see no reason why
.        C                                    G G7
 I mistreated my baby, I can't see no reason why
.D                                     C                  G
 Every time I thinks about it, I just wring my hands and cry

.                                                                  G7
 Would the good old baby apologise or would she sympathise with me?
.          C                                                    G  G7
 Would the good old baby apologise or would she sympathise with me?
.D                                 C                          G
 She's a brownskin woman, just as sweet as a girl friend can be

.                                            G7
 I love my baby, but why can't we can't agree
.   C                                      G  G7
 I love my woman, but why can't we can't agree
.D                                 C              G
 I really love that woman, wonder why we can't agree

.                                                           G7
 It's your opinion friend-girl, that I may be right or wrong
.          C                                           G    G7
 It's your opinion friend-girl, that I may be right or wrong
.D                                     C
 But when you watch your close friend, baby, then your enemies
.                G
 can't do you no harm

.           G                                                G7
 When you got a good friend that will stay right by your side
.           C                                                G  G7
 When you got a good friend that will stay right by your side   
.D                                      C                  G
 Give her all your spare time, try to love and treat her right</lyrics>

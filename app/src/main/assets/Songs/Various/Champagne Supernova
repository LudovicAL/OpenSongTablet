  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                               G
 How many special people change, how many lives are livin' strange
.F#m                                   E
 Where were you while we were gettin' high?
.A                               G
 Slowly walkin' down the hall, faster than a cannonball
.F#m                                   E
 Where were you while we were gettin' high?

[C]
.                  A                          G
 Someday you will find me, caught beneath the landslide
.     F#m                        E
 In a Champagne Supernova in the sky
.                  A                          G
 Someday you will find me, caught beneath the landslide
.     F#m                    E                         A
 In a Champagne Supernova, Champagne Supernova in the sky

[V2]
 Wake up the dawn &amp; ask her why a dreamer dreams she'll never die
 Wipe that tear away now from your eye
 Slowly walkin' down the hall, faster than a cannonball
 Where were you while we were gettin' high?

;Chorus
.     D                                                  A Asus4 A
 Cos people believe that they're gonna get away for the summer   
.     D                          Bm
 But you and I we live and die, the world's still spinning round
.              E                    A      G      F#m      E
 We don't know why, why, why, why, why.                    

;Repeat verse 1 and chorus</lyrics>

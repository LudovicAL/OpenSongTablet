.       D               G         D            G
 Well I think it's fine  building jumbo planes 
.   D             G     D             G
 Or taking a ride  on a  cosmic train 
.D                G       D            G
 Switch on summer  from a slot machine 
.     D                           G
 Yes, get what you want to if you want
.                   D        G
 'Cause you can get anything 

[C
.Em                  A
 I know we've come a long way,
.Em             A
 We're changing day to day
.Em          A                     D G    D   G
 But tell me where do the children play       
[

.         D             G     D                  G
 Well you roll on roads  over fresh green grass, 
.         D            G        D          G
 For your lorry loads,  pumping petrol gas 
.        D              G        D              G
 And you make them long  and you make the tough 
.         C                 G
 But they just go on and on 
.                      C             G
 And it seems that you can't get off 

;Chorus

.            D               G         D            G
 Well you've cracked the sky  scrapers fill the air 
.             D                G                           D
 But you will keep on building higher 'til there's no more room up there
.G

.         C              G         C            G
 Will you make us laugh,  will you make us cry, 
.         C                    G
 Will you tell us when to live 
.                 C            G
 Will you tell us when to die?

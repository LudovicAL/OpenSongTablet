.C              Gm7                     F              C
 Just yesterday  morning they let me know you were gone
.            G                      Bb
 Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
.C                 Gm7           F               C
 I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
.              G             Bb
 I just cant remember who to send it to

[C]
.F         Dm7      G11       C
 I've seen fire and I've seen rain
.          F                 Dm7     G11         C
 I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
.      F                   Dm7       G11       C
 I saw lonely times when I could not find a friend
.      Bb     F/A              G7      Gm7   C7   C9
 But I always thought that I'd see you again

.          C                 Gm7              F                   C
 Won't you look down upon me Jesus you got to help me make a stand
.                G               Bb
 You just got to see me through another day
.C         Gm7           F          C
 My body's aching and my time is at hand
.           G           Bb
 And I wont make it any other way

;chorus

.     C                     Gm7          F                       C
 Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun
.                    G                     Bb
 Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
.             C                    Gm7               F                    C
 Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
.                 G                  Bb
 Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

. A                  D
 Six o'clock in the morning
.            A                D
 You're the last to hear the warning
.                A                 D                   A D
 You've been trying to throw your arms around the world

 You've been falling off the sidewalk
 Your lips move but you can't talk
 Tryin' to throw your arms around the world

.           A            D            A         D      A  D A D
 I'm gonna run to you...run to you...run to you...be still
.           A            D            A         D      A   D AD
 I'm gonna run to you...run to you...run to you...woman I will

 Sunrise like a nosebleed, your head hurts and you can't breathe
 You been tryin' to throw you arms around the world
 How far are you gonna go before you lose your way back home?
 You've been trying to throw your arms around the world

 I'm gonna run to you...

 I dreamed that I saw Dali with a supermarket trolley
 He was trying to throw his arms around a girl
 He took an open top beetle through the eye of a needle
 He was tryin' to throw his arms around the world

 I'm gonna run to you...

[B] A-E-D-A      A-E-D      A-D-A-D-.....

 Nothin' much to say I guess, just the same as all the rest
 Been trying to throw your arms around the world
 A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle
 When you're tryin' to throw your arms around the world

 I'm gonna run to you...run to you
 I'm gonna run to you...run to you
 I'm gonna run to you...run to you
 Woman be still...woman be still
 Be still...woman be still, woman I will</lyrics>

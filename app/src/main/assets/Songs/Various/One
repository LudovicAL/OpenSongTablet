.Am            Dsus2   Fmaj7              G
 Is it getting better, or do you feel the same
.Am              Dsus2          Fmaj7                  G
 Will it make it easier on you, now you got someone to blame

.         C         Am        Fmaj7                C
 You say: one love, one life, when it's one needs, in the night
.     C         Am                  Fmaj7               C
 It's one love, we get to share it, it leaves you baby, if you don't care for it
.CAm Fmaj7 C
    

.Am         Dsus2      Fmaj7                        G
 Did I disappoint you? Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
.Am               Dsus2           Fmaj7                     G
 You act like you never had love, and you want me to go without

.          C         Am       Fmaj7                    C
 Well it's too late, tonight, to drag that past out, into the light
.C                    Am                      Fmaj7             C
 We're one, but we're not the same, we get to carry each other, carry each other one
.CAm Fmaj7 C
    

.Am                        Dsus2     Fmaj7                       G
 Have you come here for forgiveness? Have you come tor raise the dead?
.Am                         Dsus2 Fmaj7                 G
 Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head?

.      C             Am              Fmaj7                         C
 Did I ask too much? More than a lot You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
.C          Am                     Fmaj7                       C
 We're one, but we're not the same We hurt each other, then we do it again

.         C                 Am                 C                 Am
 You say: love is a temple, love a higher law, love is a temple, love the higher law
.    C                   G
 You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
.    G                  Fmaj7               Fmaj7
 And I can't be holding on to what you got, when all you got is hurt

.C         Am         Fmaj7                C
 One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should
.C         Am               Fmaj7    C
 One life, with each other, sisters, brothers
.C         Am                                Fmaj7             C
 One life, but we're not the same, we get to carry each other, carry each other</lyrics>

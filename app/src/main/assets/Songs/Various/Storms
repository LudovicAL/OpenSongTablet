.D                       G
 Every night that goes between
.         A      Bm
 I feel a little less
.       D                   G
 As you slowly go away from me
.               A     Bm
 this is only another test

.    D                      G
 And every night you do not come
.              A      Bm
 your softness fades away
.      D
 Did I ever really
.          G
 care that much?
.                  A       Bm
 Is there anything left to say?

.G     Bm7     D
 Every hour of fear I spend
.   G    A        Bm
 my body tries to cry
.G      Bm7          D
 living through each empty night
.  G      A
 a deadly call inBmside

.     D                     G
 So I try to say goodbye my friend
.                           A         Bm
 I'd like to leave you with something warm
.    D                              G
 But never have I been a blue, calm sea
.              A       Bm
 I have always  been a storm
.G      A       Bm
 always  been a storm
.     G      A       Bm
 ooh, always  been a storm
.       G      A       Bm         G
 I have always  been a storm      
.D     A7    D        G
                   we were frail
.D     A7    D     G
                   
.D     A7    D
                   She said
. G                   D          A7       D
 "every night he will break your heart"   
.              G
 I should have known from the first
.D           A7         D        G
  I'd be the broken hearted      
.D     A7    D
             
.  G                        D     A7
 I loved you from the start       
.D                  G     D     A7
       Save us                  
.        D
 And not  all the prayers in the world
.     G        D     A7
 save us.

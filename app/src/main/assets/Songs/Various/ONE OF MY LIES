.C#         G#                    Bbm            F
 When I was younger I thought the world circled around me
.       F#        C#             G#
 But in time I realized I was so wrong
 My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
 It was a tragic case of my reality

.       F#              G#
 Do you think your indestructable
 And no one can touch you?
 Well I think your disposable
 And it's time you knew the truth
.                          C#  Bbm  G#
 Cause it's just one of my lies     
 Well it's just one of my lies
 And all I want to do is get real high
 Well it's just one of my lies

 Why does my life have to be so small yet death is forever?
 And does forever have a life to call its own?
 Don't give me an answer cause you only know as much as I know
 Unless you've been there once, well I hardly think so

.F#   G#
        I used to pray all night
 Before I lay myself down
 My mother said it was right
 Her mother said it too
.C#  Bbm G#

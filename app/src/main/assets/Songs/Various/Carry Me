.E                    B  A                C#m B
  When I was a young man, I found an old dream
.E                        B         A                 C#m B
  It was as battered and worn a one, as you have ever seen
.E            B             A                C#m B
  I invented some new wings, and I painted a nose
.E             B               A     C#m   A
  I wished so hard, up in the air, I ro-o-ose, singing
.E                     D       A            E
  Carry me, carry me, carry me, above the world
.                     D      A E
 Carry me, carry me, carry me

.E                 B      A                     C#m B
  And I once loved a girl, she was younger than me
.E                      B
  Her parents kept her locked, up in their lives
.             A                           C#m         B
 And she was crying, she was wishing she could be free
.E             B
  Of course I mostly remember her laughing
.A                               C#m B
  Standing there and watching us play
.E              B        A           C#m                 A
  For a while then, the music, would take her away and she'd be singing
.E                     D       A             E
  Carry me, carry me, carry me, above this world
.                     D       A            E
 Carry me, carry me, carry me, above the world
.E                B        A
  Then there was my mother, she was lying in white sheets there
.            C#m           B
 And she was waiting to die
.E                          B                            A
  She said if you just reach underneath this bed, and untie these weights
.         C#m      B
 I could surely fly
.E                     B
  She's still smiling but she's tired
.A                        C#m           B
  She'd like to hear that last bell ring
.E                     B                   A       C#m        A
  You know if she still could she would, stand up, she would sing
.E                     D       A            E
  Carry me, carry me, carry me, above the world
.                     D       A       D       A       D       A       E
 Carry me, carry me, oo-ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh, ooh</lyrics>

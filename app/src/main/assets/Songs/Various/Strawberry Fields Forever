;Chorus
.G                                        Dm7
  Let me take you down cause I'm going to  strawberry fields.
.Bdim7
  Nothing is real.
.      C              E
 And nothing to get hung about
.Cmaj7                G
 Strawberry fields forever

.D         Dmaj7     D7          Em         Em/D          C
 Living is easy with eyes closed misunderstanding all you see
.             D7             G                     Em
 It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
.C              D           C
  It doesn't matter much to me

;Chorus

.D        Dmaj7       D7      Em        Em/D            C
 No one I think is in my tree I mean it must be high or low
.             D7                  G                Em
 That is, you know you can't tune in, but it's all right
.C           D                  C
  That is, I think it's not too bad

;Chorus

.D      Dmaj7    D7                  Em             Em/D            C
 Always know sometimes think it's me but you know I know and it's a dream
.          D7                G                 Em
 I think I know of thee, ah, yes, but it's all wrong
.C           D           C
  That is, I think I disagree

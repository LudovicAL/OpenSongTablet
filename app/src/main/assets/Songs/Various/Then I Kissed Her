 Well I walked up to her and I asked her if she wanted to dance   
.    G                       D                            G      G
 She looked awful nice, and so I hoped she might take a chance   
.C                   G               C                       G
    When we danced I held her tight,   and then I walked her home that night

.    G                  D                         G           G
 And all the stars were shining bright and then I kissed her  

 Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
 I wanted to let her know that I was more than a friend
 I didn't know just what to do, so I whispered "I love you"
 And she said that she loved me too, and then I kissed her

.C                 C6           Cmaj7          C6      C
 I kissed her in a way that I'd never kissed a girl before
.A7                           A7                       D7
 I kissed her in a way that I hoped she'd like for evermore

 I knew that she was mine so I gave her all the love that I had
 Then one day she'll take me home to meet her mom and her dad
 And then I'll ask her to be my bride, and always be right by my side
 I felt so happy that I almost cried, and then I kissed her
 And then I kissed her
 And then I kissed her

.    Bm
 The day fell down the air got cold
.  G
 I walk out in the street
.E
 Daydreamed for a mile or two
.A
 Staring at my feet
.       Bm
 Like a working boy out of luck
.G
 falling through the cracks
.E
 Night rolled in, I turned back home
.  D    A
 A hard wind at my back

.               Bm  G          E   DA
 I'm out in the cold, body and soul 
.                  BmG               E    DA
 There's no way to go I'm out in the cold  

 When I woke up my brain was stumed
 I could not come around
 I reach out to grab my keys
 And tumbled to the ground
 I thought of you starry-eyed, I
 wonder where you stand
 Did I just fall from your arms
 Down into the ground

 I'm out standing in a door-way

.    Bm  G       Bm    G
 I'm out walking round hands in my pockets
 I'm out in the cold</lyrics>

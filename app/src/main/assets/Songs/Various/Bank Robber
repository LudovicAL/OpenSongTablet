;The Clash
; This is as close as my ear could get it.  The problem
; is there really isn't any straight guitar playing.
; The intro lines are what I play along with the initial
; humming.  As always, corrections encouraged.

.G              C      G
 My Daddy was a bankrobber
.G                   C G
 But he never hurt nobody
.G                C         G
 He just loved to live that way
.       C        D          G
 And he loved to steal your money
.G                 C       G
 Some is rich, and some is poor
.G                  C     G
 That's the way the world is
.G                      C     G
 But I don't believe in lying back
.C          D        G
 Sayin' how bad your luck is

 So we came to jazz it up
 We never loved a shovel
 Break your back to earn your pay
 An' don't forget to grovel

 The old man spoke up in a bar
 Said I never been in prison
 A lifetime serving one machine
 Is ten times worse than prison

 Imagine if all the boys in jail
 Could get out now together
 Whadda you think they'd want to say to us?
 While we was being clever

 Someday you'll meet your rocking chair
 Cos that's where we're spinning
 There's no point to wanna comb your hair
 When it's grey and thinning

 Run rabbit run
 Strike out boys, for the hills
 I can find that hole in the wall
 And I know that they never will</lyrics>

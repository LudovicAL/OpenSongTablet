.Bm                  D
 Haven't seen you in quite a while
.     Em
 I was down the hold, just passing time
.Bm                  D
 Last time we met was a low-lit room
.           Em
 We were as close together as bride and groom

.D9                  A9
 We ate the food, we drank the wine
.Em                      D/G
 Everybody having a good time
.          D9
 Except you
.            A9
 You were talking about the end of the world

 I took the money, I spiked your drink
 You miss too much these days if you stop to think
 You led me on with those innocent eyes
 You know I love the element of surprise
 In the garden I was playing the tart
 I kissed your lips and broke your heart
 You, you were acting like it was the end of the world

 In my dream I was drowning my sorrows
 But my sorrows they learned to swim
 Surrounding me, going down on me
 Spilling over the brim
 Waves of regret, waves of joy
 I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
 You, you said you'd wait 'til the end of the world.

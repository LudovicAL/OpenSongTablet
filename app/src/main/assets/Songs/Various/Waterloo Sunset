.              D                    A                  G
 1. Dirty old river, must you keep rolling, rolling into the night
.           D                 A                   G
 People so busy make me feel dizzy, taxi lights shine so bright
.       Em    B            Em7  A
 But i don't     need no friends
.              D                A               G      G B E
 As long as i gaze on Waterloo Sunset, i am in paradise
.              E7                       A    G B E
 Every day i look at the world from my window
.                      E7             A7
 The chilly-chilliest evening time,  Waterloo sunset's fine.

 2. Terry meets Julie, Waterloo Station, every Friday night
 But i am so lazy, don't want to wander, i stay at home at night
 But i don't feel afraid
 As long as i gaze on Waterloo Sunset, i am in paradise
 Every day i look at the world from my window
 The chilly chilliest evening time,  Waterloo sunset's fine.

 3. Millions of people swarming like flies round Waterloo underground
 Terry and Julie cross over the river where they feel safe and sound
 And they don't need no friends
 As long as they gaze on Waterloo Sunset, they are in paradise
 Every day i look at the world from my window
 The chilly chilliest evening time,  Waterloo sunset's fine.</lyrics>

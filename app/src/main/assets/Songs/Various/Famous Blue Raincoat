.Am7         F          Dm7         Em7
                                    
.     Am                       F
 It's four in the morning, the end of December
.    Dm7                      Em7
 I'm writing you now, just to see if you're better
.Am                     F
 New York is cold but I like where I'm living
.        Dm7                     Em7
 There's music on Clinton street all through the evening
.Am                 Bm7
 I hear that you're building your little
.Am            Bm7
 house deep in the desert
.Am7               G
 You're living for nothing now,
.              Am7                  G
 I hope you're keeping some kind of record
.        C                                G
 Yes and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
.                             Am
 She said that you gave it to her
.                                  Bm7    G
 That night that you planned to go clear  
.F               Em7
 Did you ever go clear
.Am7         F          Dm7         Em7
                                    

.    Am                        F
 The last time we saw you, you looked so much older
.     Dm7                      Em7
 Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
.    Am                     F
 You been to the station to meet every train
.    Dm7               Em7
 You came home without Lily Marlene
.Am                 Bm7   Am                 Bm7
 And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
.Am7               G     Am7              G
 And when she came back, she was nobody's wife
.        C                                 G
 Well, I see you there with a rose in your teeth
.                    Am
 One more thin gipsy thief
.                    Bm7         G
 Well, I see Jane's awake        
.F               Em7
 She sends her regards
.Am7         F          Dm7         Em7
                                    

.    Am                     F
 And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
.Dm7                 Em7
 What can I possibly say
.  Am                       F
 I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
.    Dm7                  Em7
 I'm glad you stood in my way
.Am               Bm7     Am              Bm7
 If you ever come by here for Jane or for me
.Am7                G        Am7              G
 Well, your enemy's sleeping and his woman is free
.     C                          G
 Yes, thanks for the trouble you took from her eyes
.                 Am7                       Bm7  G
 I thought it was there for good so I never tried

.    C                                G
 And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
.                             Am7
 She said that you gave it to her
.                                  Bm7    G
 That night that you planned to go clear  
.F             Em7
 Sincerely, L. Cohen

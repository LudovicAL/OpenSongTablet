;Verse
.C                         G        Am
     We like driving on a saturday night
.C                            G           B
     past the leisure centre left at the lights
.                       C                 F             Em
 Oh we don't look for trouble, but if it comes we don't run
.                 C               F       Em
 Looking out for trouble is what we call fun

[C
.    B                               C            G      B
 Oh you, you in the jesus sandals, wouldn't you like to come
.                              C          G          B
 Over and watch some vandals smashing up someone's home

;Verse 2
.C                              G             Am
    We can't help it we're so thick we can't think
.C                               G              B
    Can't think of anything but shit sleep and drink
.              C             F       Em
 And we like women, Up The Women we say
.               C                    F             Em
 And if we get lucky, we might even meet some one day

;Chorus

.C                         Em
 Mister we just want your car
.           C                    Em
 Cos we're taking a girl to the reservoir
.F            F#                   B
 All All the papers say "It's a tragedy"
 But don't you wanna come and see?

;Chords to verse and Chorus

;Repeat last verse

;last line
.F        F#                   Em
 All the papers say "It's a tragedy"</lyrics>

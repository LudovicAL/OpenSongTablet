;Chorus
.C   G        C     Fm           C    Fm       G
 Hey Bungalow Bill  what did you kill Bungalow Bill
.A   E7       A     Dm           A    Dm       E7
 Hey Bungalow Bill  what did you kill Bungalow Bill

.   Am             C                F                 G
 He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun  
.Am         C            F
 In case of accidents he always took his mom
.         Em           G             Am             Fm
 He's the All-American bullet headed Saxon mother's son
 All the children sing...

;Chorus

.Am          C                F            G
 Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lie
.Am           C              F           G
 Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
.Em         G                 Am                Fm
 So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
 All the children sing...

;Chorus

.Am           C               F              G
 The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
.Am          C                 F                G
 Not when he looked so fierce, his mummy butted in
.Em             G                       Am            Fm
 If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
 All the children sing...</lyrics>

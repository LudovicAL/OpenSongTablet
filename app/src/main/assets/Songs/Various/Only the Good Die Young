.F        C        Am        F        G        C        F        C        Am        F        G
                                                                                             
.F                 C            Am        F                    G
 Come out Virginia don't let me wait, you Catholic girls start much too late
.       F                  C             Am      F                    G
 Ah but sooner or later it comes down to fate, I might as well be the one
.          F                       C       Am         F                      G          C
 Well they showed you a statue and told to pray, they built you a temple and locked you away
.       F                       C              Am       F                          G
 Ah but they never told you the price that you pay, the things that you might have done
.                      C    F               G     C                        F         G              C
 For only the good die young, that's what I said,  only the good die young, only the good die young 

.               F                  C         Am        F                    G         C
 You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd, we ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
.   F                   C       Am        F                  G
 We might be laughing a bit too loud, but that never hurt no one
.        F            C         Am    F                     G           C
 So come on Virginia, show me a sign, send up a signal I'll throw you a line
.F                                 C        Am   F                 G
 That stained glass curtain you're hiding behind never lets in the sun
.                          C    F  G         C                       F         G             C
 Darlin' only the good die young   I tell ya only the good die young, only the good die young

.          G                      F                   C
 You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation,
.          D                    F
 You got a brand new soul and a cross of gold
.         G                         F                 C
 Well Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information
.           D                                           F      C  Dm C  G
 You didn't count on me, when you were counting on your rosary oh oh oh oh
.         F                        C              Am    F                        G        C
 And they say there's a heaven for those who will wait, some say it's better but I say it ain't
.           F                           C            Am          F                     G
 I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints, the sinners are much more fun
.                                C     F G   C                       F         G        C     G F C D F
 You know that only the good die young baby, only the good die young, only the good die young         

.              G                           F                  C
 You said your mother told you all I could give you was a reputation
.          D                                    F              C  Dm C  G
 She never cared for me, but did she ever say a prayer for me? oh oh oh oh
.F                                 C           Am               F                    G        C
 Come out, Come out, Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait, you Catholic girls start much too late
.       F                  C             Am      F                    G
 Ah but sooner or later it comes down to fate, I might as well be the one
.                  C     F          G    C                  F               G        C     F G C
 Only the good die young I tell you baby, only the good die young, only the good die young</lyrics>

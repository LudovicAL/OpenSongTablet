.D                                       D*
 A great lord came walking through the forest one morning
.        G               D
 With a weapon in his hand
.                           D*
 Rich was his castle, he lacked for nothing
.    G               A
 Killing was his plan
.        Bm                      F#m
 When a white bird flew by, she fell from the sky
.  G             D         Em            A               D
 Nothing was found, only blood on the ground, she was gone

.D                         D*                    G              D
 Cursing his fortune, he turned to the forest to kill once again
.                              D*                        G            A
 Standing before him was a lovely young woman with her head hung in pain
.              Bm                   F#m
 When he saw her, his eyes were filled with desire
.      G                 D    Em           A
 He said "I must have her, she must be mine
.                DG A
 She will be mine"

.D                            D*
 He offered her silver, he offered her gold
.            G                D
 But she threw it on the ground
.                                D*
 He fell to his knees and he begged her, "Oh please
.            G                             D
 Come with me, what you wish will be found"
.        Bm                          F#m
 She said, "Sir, I'll go if you'll put up your bow
.    G           D       Em              A
 Spare these creatures, leave them in peace
.                F#
 You have no need

.          Em         A             D
 But her words were lost in the wind
.      G         D           A
 His eyes were fixed on a queen
.     Bm                 F#m     Em      A             D
 And all he saw was a woman but all she was, was a dream
.Bm F#m G Bm F#m Em A
 Da-ah
.   Bm             F#m        Em      A           D
 All he saw was a woman and all she was, was a dream

 Other verses :
 He took her and bound her with ropes tied around her
 To his castle he did ride
 In the wood was a bower where stood an an old tower
 And he threw her deep inside
 And the birds left the sky and a terrible cry
 Brought thunder and lightning, rain falling down
 Tears on the ground

 All through the days on her face he would gaze
 For she was lovely as the spring
 No words would she speaketh but leave them in peace
 And some sad lament she would sing
 One day by the door, through the window he saw
 A single white feather lying on the floor
 She was there no more

 Now that great lord is dying, his cold heart is crying
 For the love of a girl
 For many an hour he has wept on the tower
 For she meant more than the world
 One day in the sky a white bird flew by
 He lifted his hands, he cried out in pain
 Come back again

 But his words were lost in the wind
 His castle was built upon sand
 All he saw was her memory
 And all he yearned was her hand
 Da  aa
 All she was, was a memory
 And all he yearned was her hand</lyrics>

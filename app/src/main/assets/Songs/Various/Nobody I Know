.C                   Dm7     G7        C     Dm7     G7
 Nobody I know could love me more than you.          
.C                       Bb        G7    D7     G7
 You can give me so much love it seems untrue.  
.C                      Em
 Listen to the bird who sings it in the tree,
.Am                             Ab
 and the when you've heard him, see if you agree.
.C                   Dm7      G7        C     Dm7     G7
 Nobody I know could love you more than me.           

 Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
 Everyone I know is sure it shines on you.
 Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
 suddenly it seems, I've found a paradise.
.C                   Dm7       G7        C       D
 Everywhere I go the sun comes shining through.  
.G7      C
         

.Am               E7             A                    C
 Means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one.
.Am                    C                Dm7     G7
 When other lovers are gone, we'll live on,     
.           C     Dm7       G7
 we'll live on.

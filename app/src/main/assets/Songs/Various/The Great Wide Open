;Intro 2x
.Em    Emaj7      Em7     Em6
                          
.Em    Emaj7           Em7           Em6    Em         Emaj7       Em7      Em6
 Eddie waited till he finished high school, he went to Hollywood, got a tattoo
.Am       Am/G               Am/F#     Am/G
 He met a girl out there with a tattoo too,
.    G          F    C       G      C      G
 The future was wide open.                 

.Em         Emaj7              Em7        Em6    Em         Emaj7               Em7         Em6
 They moved into a place they both could afford, he found a nightclub he could work at the door
.Am        Am/G            Am/F#          Am/G
 She had a guitar and she taught him some chords,
.    G   F       C          G      C      G        G     C      G          D
 The sky was the limit.                                                    

;Chorus
.G        C          Dsus4 G         Em       D
 Into the great wide open, under the skies of blue
.G          C          Dsus4   G         Em    Em    A
 Out in the great wide open, a rebel without a clue  

.Em         Emaj7          Em7             Em6    Em        Emaj7       Em7          Em6
 The papers said Ed always played from the heart, he got an agent and a roadie named Bart
.Am          Am/G          Am/F#       Am/G
 They made a record and it went in the charts,
.    G   F       C             G      C      G        G      C      G
 The sky was the limit.                                             

.Em          Emaj7       Em7               Em6    Em            Emaj7          Em7         Em6
 His leather jacket had chains that would jingle, they both met movie stars, partied and mingled
.Am        Am/G        Am/F#        Am/G
 Their A&amp;R man said "I don't hear a single."
.    G          F    C          G      C      G        G       C      G          D
 The future was wide open.

.F  Am  F   A
            
.     F
 I was bruised and battered I couldn't tell what I felt
.     Am
 I was unrecognizable to myself
.      F
 saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
.                   Am
 oh brother are you gonna leave me wasting like this on the
.             Bb                F/A         C      Bb     F/A   C
 streets of Philadelphia                                        
 (lie lie lie lah lie lie lie lah lie... )

 I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
 I heard voices of friends vanished and gone
 At night I hear the blood in my veins
 just as black and whispery as the rain on the streets of Philadelphia

.Bb    F/A   C     Bb      F/A
                           
.Bb                      Dm
  Ain't no angel gonna greet me
.Bb                      F
  It's just you and I my friend
.Am                   Bb
  and my clothes don't fit me no more   I walked a
.C
  thousand miles just to slip this skin

 The night is falling, I'm lying awake
 I can feel myself fading away
 so receive me brother with your fateless kiss or
 will we leave each other alone like this on the
 streets of Philadelphia...

.Bb        F/A
 (lie lie... )

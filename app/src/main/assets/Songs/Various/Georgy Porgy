.C7+                      D6                        Em7/9   Em7
 It's not your situation, I just need contemplation  over   you
.C7+                    D6                           Em7/9    Em7
 I'm not so systematic, it's just that I'm an addict for your love

[C]
.    C7+
 I'm not the only one that holds you,
.  Am9
 I never ever should have told you
.Am9        B7/5+   B7     B7/5+ B7
 You're my  only     girl     
.    C7+
 I'm not the only one that holds you,
.  Am9
 I never ever should have told you
.Am9       B7/5+   B7     B7/5+ B7
 You're my  only     world

.C7+                                 D6                           Em7/9     Em7
 Just think how long I've known you, It's long for me to own you, lock  and  key
. C7+                       D6                          Em7/9  Em7
 It's really not confusing, I'm just the young illusion, can't you see

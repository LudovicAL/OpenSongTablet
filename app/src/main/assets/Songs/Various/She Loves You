 She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah. She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

.    C                      Am          Em            G7
 You think you've lost your love when I saw her yesterday.
.     C                  Am         Em              G7
 It's you she's thinking of and she told me what to say.
.             Am
 She says she loves you and you know that can't be bad.
.        F                 Dm                 G7
 Yes she loves you and you know you should be glad. Oooh.

.    C                Am            Em              G7
 She said you were to know that she almost lost her mind.
.    C                Am           Em              G7
 And now she says she knows you're not the hurting kind.
.             Am
 She says she loves you and you know that can't be bad.
.        F                 Dm                 G7
 Yes she loves you and you know you should be glad. Oooh.

.    Am                               D7
 She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah. She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah.
.           F                   G7                 C
 and with a love like that, you know you should be glad.

.    C             Am     Em              G7
 And now its up to you, I think it's only fair.
.   C                 Am     Em         G7
 If I should hurt you too, apologize to her.
.            Am
 Because she loves you, and you know that can't be bad.
.        F                 Dm                 G7
 Yes she loves you and you know you should be glad. Oooh.

;Intro:
.Em     C     Em      C      Em     D      Em     D      Em
                                                         

.       Em                   G                                        C
 It was late at night on the open road. Speeding like a man on the run.
.  C        G/B      Am     G           D
 A lifetime spent preparing for the journey.
.       Em                 G                                            C
 He was closer now and the search was on, reading from a map in the mind,
.     C           G/B          Am            G           D
 yes, there's the ragged hill, and there's a boat on the river.
.             Em              D             Em              D/F#
 And when the rain came down,    he heard a wild dog howl,  
.              C              G/B             C               G/D
 There were voicesin the night (don't do it), voices out of sight (don't do it).
.C                              B7
 Too many men have failed before     whatever you do.

[C]
.Em    D          Em                  C     D
 Don't pay the ferryman, don't even fix a price.
.Em    D          Em             C               D          Em    D     Em     D       Em
 Don't pay the ferryman until he gets you to the other side.

 In the roaming mist then he gets on board, now there'll be no turning back.
 Beware that hooded old man at the ruder.
 And then the lightning flashed and the thunder roared and people calling out his name,
 and dancing bows that jabbered and amoaned on the water.
 And then the ferryman said, there is trouble ahead,
 so you must pay me now (don't do it), you must pay me now (don't do it),
 and still that voice came though the air, whatever you do.

;Chorus

.Em     C        B7                            Em
                           Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh,

;Chorus

.Em    D                   D    Em
 Don't pay ----------- the ferryman.</lyrics>

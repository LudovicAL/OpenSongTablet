.Em    D     Em    D        Em      D      Em          D
 Lyin' in my bed I hear the clock tick and think of you
.Em     D     Em     D    Em        D       Em          D
 Caught up in circles  confusion is nothing new         
.G    A     F#m  G       A      F#m
 Flashback, warm nights, almost left behind
.G   A       F#m    G      A11
 Suitcase of memories time after

.Em  D         Em      D      Em      D   Em   D
 Sometimes you picture me I'm walking too far ahead
.Em     D       Em    D       Em   D           Em         D
 You're calling to me I can't hear what you've said       
.     G   A    F#m    G     A      F#m
 Then you say  go slow    I fall behind
.G   A           F#m    G
 The second hand unwinds

;Chorus
.          A                         Bm        G       A     D
 If you're lost you can look and you will find me time after time
.       A                          Bm     G        A     D
 If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting time after time

.Em    D  Em      D         Em       D   Em        D
 After my picture fades and darkness has turned to grey
.Em   D           Em      D      Em        D  Em   D
 Watching through windows you're wondering if I'm okay
.G     A  F#m      G         A       F#m
 Secrets  stolen   from deep inside  
.G    A         F#m    G
 The drum beats out of time

;Chorus once

.     G   A    F#m    G     A      F#m
 Then you say  go slow    I fall behind
.G   A           F#m    G
 The second hand unwinds</lyrics>

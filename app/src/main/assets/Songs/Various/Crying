;Verse 1:
.D
 I was all right for a while
 I could smile for a while
 But I saw you last night
.            D+
 You held my hand so tight
.         G              Gm
 As you stopped to say hello
.        D                   A7
 Oh you wished me well, you couldn't tell
 That I'd been

;Chorus 1:
.D       F#m
 Crying  over you
.D       F#m
 Crying  over you
.     G            A
 Then you said so long
.          G            A
 Left me standing all alone
.           D       D+      G      Gm
 Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying

;Post-chorus:
.               D
 It's hard to understand
.         A7
 But the touch of your hand
.              D
 Can start me crying

;Verse 2:
 I thought that I was over you
 But it's true, so true
 I love you even more
 Than I did before
 But darling, what can I do
 Now you don't love me
 And I'll always be

;Chorus 2:
 Crying  over you
 Crying  over you
 Yes, now you're gone
 And from this moment on
 I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying

;Coda:
.     D          Bm
 I'm crying, crying
.G        A7    D A7 D G D
 Oh-oh-oh-over you</lyrics>

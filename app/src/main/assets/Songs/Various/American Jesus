.A                      C
   I don't need to be a global citizen
.F                             G
   because I'm blessed by nationality
.A                   C
   I'm a member of a growing populace
.F                     G
   we enforced our popularity

.A                               C
   there are things that seem to pull us under and
.F                       G
   there are things that drag us down
.A                           C
   but there's a power and a vital presence
.       F           E
 that's lurking all around

.A       C        F       G
   we've got the american jesus
.A         C      F    G
   see him on the interstate
.A       C       D        F
   we've got the american jesus
.A                   G             F
 he helped build the president's estate

 I feel sorry for the earth's population
 'cuz so few live in the u.s.a.
 at least the foreigners can copy our morality
 they can visit but they cannot stay
 only precious few can garner our prosperity
 it makes us walk with renewed confidence
 we've got a place to go when we die
 and the architecht resides right here

 we've got the american jesus
 postering the ...(?)...
 we've got the american jesus
 overwhelming millions every day

 he's the farmer's barren fields
 the force the army wields
 the expression in the faces of the starving millions
 the power of the man
 he's the fuel that drives the clan
 he's the motive and the conscience of the murderer
 he's the preacher on tv
 the false sincerity
 the form letter that's written by the big computers
 he's the nuclear bombs
 and the kids with no moms
 and I'm fearful that he's inside me

 we've got the american jesus...</lyrics>

.Bb Bbm Gbmaj7 F7
            
.Bb                 Eb         F                Dm7
 If you search for tenderness, it isn't hard to find
.Eb               Gm               Am   Cm7F   F7
 You can have the love you need to live        
.Bb                  C                      F               D
 And if you look for truthfulness you might just as well be blind
.   Eb              A             D
 It always seems to be so hard to give

;chorus
[C]
.Ebmaj7F7  D                Gm7  F
 Honesty   is such a lonely word 
.Eb          F       Bb D
 Everyone is so untrue  
.Ebmaj7F7  D              Gm7
 Honesty   is hardly ever heard
.Eb                F           Bb F9sus
 But mostly what I need from you  
[]

.Bb           Eb           F                 Dm7
 I can always find someone to say they sympathize
.Eb           Gm              Am     Cm7F  F7
 If I wear my heart out on my sleeve       
.Bb                    C              F                 D
 But I don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty lies
.Eb            A             D
 All I want is someone to believe

;repeat chorus

.Gm                  D
 I can find a lover, I can find a friend
.F7                            C
 I can have security until the bitter end
.Eb         F         F7    Eb            Bb
 Anyone can comfort me with promises again
.     C7      F  D Eb F9sus
 I know, I know-oh-wo-wo-wo
.Bb               Eb         F                    Dm
 When I'm deep inside of me, don't be too concerned
.Eb               Bb               Am   Cm7 F   F7
 I won't ask for nothing while I'm gone         
.Bb             C                     F    A      Dm
 When I want sincerity, tell me where else can I turn?
.       Eb                  A7         D7
 'Cause you're the one that I depend upon

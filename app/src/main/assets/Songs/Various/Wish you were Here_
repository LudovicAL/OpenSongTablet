.C                       D
 So, so ya think you can tell
.             Am                   G                          D
 heaven from hell, blue skies from pain, can you tell a green  field
.                  C                    Am                       G
 from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do ya think ya can tell?
.                    C                       D
 Did they get you to trade, your hero's for ghosts, hot ashes for
.Am
 trees
.              G                             D                 C
 Hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change, did you exchange,
.                      Am                          G
 a walk on part in the war, for a lead role in a cage?

.C                               D
 How I wish, how I wish you were here,
.           Am                                   G                  D
 We're just two lost soles swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
.                                C                                Am
 Running over the same old ground, but have we found the same old fears,
.               G
 Wish you were here</lyrics>

.Dm            C                Bb
 Just down the street from your hotel, baby
.Dm        C            Bb
 I stay at home with my disease
.Dm             C          Bb
 And ain't this position familiar, darling
.Dm                C            Bb
 Well, all monkeys do what they see
.Gm                        Bb
 Help me stay awake, I'm falling...

 Down on Virginia and La Loma
 Where I got friends who'll care for me
 You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted
 I got an attitude of need
 Help me stay awake, I'm falling...

 CHORUS
[C
.F         C            Bb
 Asleep in perfect blue buildings
.F          C           Bb
 Beside the green apple sea
.F              C       Bb
 Gonna get me a little oblivion, baby
.F             C     Bb            Dm**                   F
 Try to keep myself away from  1.| me     2.|(myself and) me
[

 It's 430 A.M. on a Tuesday
 It doesn't get much worse than this
 In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle
 of these lives which are completely meaningless
 Help me stay awake, I'm falling...

;CHORUS

 I got bones beneath my skin, and mister...
 There's a skeleton in every man's house
 Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody
 There's a dead man trying to get out
 Please help me stay awake, I'm falling...

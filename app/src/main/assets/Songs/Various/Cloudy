 Cloudy,
.                                  G
 The sky is grey and white and cloudy.
.                                D  F#7  Ddim
 Sometimes I think it's hanging down on me.
. A                         F#7
 It's hitch-hike a hundred miles.
.      A             Bm
 I'm a rag-a-muffin child.
. E
 Pointed finger, painted smile.
.    A                             A7
 I left my shadow waiting down the road for me a while.

.  D
 Cloudy,
.                                          G
 My thoughts are scattered and they're cloudy.
.                      D   F#7   Ddim
 They have no borders, no boundaries.
. A                  F#7
 They echo and they swell,
.        A             Bm
 From Tolstoy to Tinkerbell,
. E
 Down from Berkeley to Carmel.
.    A                                A7
 Got some pictures in my pocket and a lot of time to kill.

.       D
 Hey, Sunshine--
.                         G
 I haven't seen you in a long time.
.                                   D  F#7 Ddim
 Why don't you show your face and bend my mind?
.  A                        F#7
 These clouds stick to the sky,
.         A                Bm
 Like a floating question, why?
. E
 And they linger there to die.
.A                                           A7
 They don't know where they're going, and my friend, neither do I.

.   D      G        D    G

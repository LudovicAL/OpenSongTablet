.G        C       Em      F    G
                               

.Em        Am7         D                 G
 Times are hard you're afraid to pay the fee
.       C                 F            G              D
 So you find yourself somebody who can do the job for free
.         Em            Am7         D                  G
 When you need a bit of lovin cause your man is out of town
.           C               F              G             Am
 That's the time you get me runnin and you know I'll be around

;Chorus
.G     Cmaj7           Em            F      F#  G
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work oh yeah       
.G       Cmaj7         Em            F      F#  G
 I don't wanna do your dirty work no more       
.G     Cmaj7           Em            F      F#  G
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work oh yeah       

.Em        Am7            D             G
 Light the candle put the lock upon the door
.         C                  F            G              D
 You have sent the maid home early like a thousand times before
.         Em            Am7         D        G
 Like the castle in its corner in a medevial game
.     C            F             G                  Am
 I forsee terrible trouble and I stay here just the same

;Solo

.G      Em     G      Em     F       G       Dm
                                             

;Chorus
.G     Cmaj7           Em            F      F#  G
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work oh yeah       
.G       Cmaj7         Em            F      F#  G
 I don't wanna do your dirty work no more       
.G     Cmaj7           Em            F      F#  G
 I'm a fool to do your dirty work oh yeah</lyrics>

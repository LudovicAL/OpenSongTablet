.          A                              D
 The way I see it he said, you just can't win it,
.            C                                              G
 Everybody's in it for their own gain; you can't please 'em all,
.               F                       A
 There's always somebody putting you down,
.                           D
 I do my best and I do good business,
.                        C
 There's a lot of people asking for my time,
.                          G
 They're tryin' to get ahead;
.                  F                   A
 they're tryin' to be a good friend of   mine,

;Chorus
.        F
 I was a free man in Paris,
.       G
 I felt unfettered and alive,
.C                  Asus4
 There was nobody callin' me up for favours
.            A
 and no-ones future to decide,
.             F
 You know I'd go back there tomorrow
.            G                  C
 but for the work I've taken on,
.            Asus4          D                A
 stokin' the star maker machinary behind the popular songs.

;Verse 2:
.          A                        D
 I deal in dreamers and telephone screamers,
.         C                                    G
 Lately I wonder what I do it for; if I had my way,
.         F                                A
 I'd just walk through those doors, and wan-der,
.                  D
 down the Champs Elysees;
.              C
 going cafe to cabaret, thinking
.                         G
 how I'd feel when I find,
.     F                   A
 that very good friend of   mine

.A
 The lights are on, but you're not home
.FG
  Your mind is not your own
.CD
  Your heart sweats, your body shakes
.A
 Another kiss is what it takes

 You can't sleep, you can't eat
 There's no doubt - you're in deep
 Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
 Another kiss is all you need

;Chorus
[C]
.F#                            Dsus2
 You like to think that you're imune to the stuff
.A
 Oh yeah
.F#                              Dsus2
 It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
.                D
 You know you're gonna have to face it   You're addicted to love
[]

 You see the signs - but you can't read
 You're running at a different speed
 Your heart beats in double time
 another kiss and you'll be mine
 A one-track mind; you can't be saved
 Oblivion is all you crave
 If there's some left over for you
 You don't mind if you do

;Chorus:

 Might as well face it: you're addicted to love
 (repeated multiple times)

;Solo:

 The light are on, but you're not home
 Your mind is not your own
 Your heart sweats your teeth grind
 Another kiss and you'll be mine

;Chorus:

 Might as well face it you're addicted to love (8x)</lyrics>

.            Em       B7               Em        B7     Em
 When you're down and troubled and you need some lovin' care
.    Am       D                G     CG
 And nothing, nothing is going right  
.F#m                 B7              Em     B7      Em
 Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there
.   Am          Bm                D7sus  D7
 To brighten up even your darkest nights 

[C
.         G           Gmaj7         C                Am
 You just call out my name, and you know, wherever I am,
.       G       Gmaj7             D7sus
 I come running  to see you again 
.G                       Gmaj7C                    Am
 Winter spring summer or fall all you got to do is call
.         C               Am7
 And I'll be there, yes I will
.D7sus        G      D7sus D7
 You've got a friend  
[

 If the sky above you grows dark and full of clouds,
 and that old north wind begins to blow
 Keep your head together, and call my name out loud
 Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door

;chorus

.F                              C
 Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
.     G                G7
 When people can be so cold
.       C                 Fm             Em
 The'll hurt you, yes and desert you and take your soul if you
.Am7
 let them
.    A7            D7susD7
 But don't you let them

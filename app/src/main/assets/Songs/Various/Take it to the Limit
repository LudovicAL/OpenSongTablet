.     C                       F                C                           F
 All alone at the end of the evening, and the bright lights have faded to blue
.       C                E7                   Am                   G     G/F    C/E
 I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have loved me, and I never knew         

.              G/D            C                      F
 You know I've always been a dreamer - spent my life running round
.                     C                     F
 And it's so hard to change - can't seem to settle down
.                         Dm     F                         F/G
 But the dreams I've seen lately  keep on turning out and burning out
.     G              F/G      G
 And turning out the same     

;Chorus
.   F            C           F         C
 So put me on a highway and show me a sign,
.     F              G              C       G      F
 And take it to the limit one more time            

.        C                          F              C                          F
 You can spend all your time making money, you can spend all your love making time
.      C           E7       Am                         G       G/F    C/E
 If it all fell to pieces tomorrow, would you still be mine?          

.                G/D              C                 F
 And when you're looking for your freedom - nobody seems to care
.                       C                   F
 And you can't find the door - can't find it anywhere
.                          Dm       F                                 F/G
 When there's nothing to believe in  still you're coming back, you're running back,
.       G               F/G      G
 You're coming back for more     

;Chorus

.F               G       F              G
 Take it to the limit,  take it to the limit,
.F               G              C        G
 Take it to the limit one more time.</lyrics>

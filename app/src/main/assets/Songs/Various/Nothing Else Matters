.Em                 D      C
 So close no matter how far
.Em                    D             C
 Couldn't be much more from the heart
.Em               D         C
 Forever trusting who we are
.G   H            Em
 And nothing else matters

.Em             D            C
 Never opened myself this way
.Em                       D      C
 Life is ours, we live it our way
.Em                      D       C
 All these words I don't just say
.G   H            Em
 And nothing else matters

.Em               D          C
 Trust I seek and find in you
.Em               D            C
 Every day for us something new
.Em              D             C
 Open mind for a different view
.G   H            Em
 And nothing else matters

[C
.C         A         D                          C
                      Never cared for what they do
.A         D                          C
            Never cared for what they know
.A         D      Em
            But I know

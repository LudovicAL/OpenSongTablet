;Intro
.Bm      A       Bm       A       Bm      A       Bm       A
                                                           
.D                             G
 Look at us baby, up all night tearing our love apart
.D                                            G                 F#m
 Are we the same two people who lived through years in the dark (ah ah)
.Bm                  Bm/A      G                        F#m
 Every time I try to walk away something makes me turn around and stay
.    Bm               A
 And I can't tell you why

.Bm      A       Bm      A
                         
.D                                                             G
 When we get crazy it just ain't right (try to keep your head) girl I get lonely too
.D                                                                                  G       F#m
 You don't have to worry just hold on tight (don't get caught in your little world) cause I love you
.Bm                       Bm/A                 G              F#m     A
 Nothings wrong as far as I can see we make it harder than it has to be
.    Bm               Bm/A         G                F#m A
 And I can't tell you why no baby, I can't tell you why 
.G                F#m
 I can't tell you why

;Solo over verse

.Bm                 Bm/A      G                       F#m            A
 Everytime I try to walk away something makes me turn around and stay
.    Bm               Bm/A          G                F#m  A
 And I can't tell you why, no baby, I can't tell you why  
.G                F#m
 I can't tell you why

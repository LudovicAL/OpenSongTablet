;The Byrds

.D   A6   Bm
 Always alone,
.G     G/F#bass   A7
 never with a     herd
.D         A6        Bm
 Prettiest mare I've ever seen,
.G      G/F#bass        A7
 you'll have to take my word

.G   G/F# bass Em         A7         D   A6 Bm
 I'm going to  catch that horse if I can  
.G   G/F# bass Em         A7         D   A6 Bm
 and when I    do I'll give her my brand  

.D          A6             Bm
 Well I was up on Stony Ridge
.G          G/F#bass       Em                   A7
 after this chestnut mare, been chasing her for weeks
.D          A6             Bm
 Oh I'd catch a glimpse of her every once in a while
.G     G/F#bass   Em    A7  A7sus A7   D
 taking her meal, bathing, fine lady   
.A6             Bm
 This one day I happen to be real close to her
.G                         G/F#bass Em
 and I saw her standing over there  
.    A7               D   A6 Bm
 so I snuck up on her nice and easy
.                G G/F#bass
 got my rope out   
.Em                      A7
 and I flung it in the air!

;CHORUS

.G   G/F#bass  Em         A7         D   A6 Bm
 I'm going to  catch that horse if I can  
.G   G/F# bass Em         A7         D   A6 Bm
 and when I    do I'll give her my brand  
.G   G/F#bass Em
 And we'll be friends for life
.G      G/F#bass       Em
 She'll be just like a wife
.G   G/F#bass Em         A7         D   A6 Bm
 I'm going to catch that horse if I can  

 And I got her and I'm pulling on her
 And she's pulling back like this mule going up a ladder
 And I take a choice and I jump right up on her
 Damned if I don't land right on top of her
 And she takes off, running up onto the ridge
 higher than I've ever been before
 She's running along just fine
 'til she stops and something spooked her
 it's a sidewinder, all coiled and ready to strike
 she doesn't know what to do for a second,
 but then, she jumps off the edge, me holding on

.D     Abass   Bbass   C           C/Bbass     Em
 Above the hills, higher than eagles were gliding
 (Ebass, F# bass)
.G                D
 suspended in the sky

.D
 over the hill
 (A bass, B bass)
.C                C/Bbass      Em
 straight for the sun we were riding
 (E bass, F# bass)
.G            G/F#bass       Asus
 my eyes were filled    with light

.D
 behind those black walls
. Abass   Bbass   C C/Bbass      Em
 below was a bottomless canyon   
 (Ebass, F# bass)
.G                D
 floating with no sound
.D
 ghosts far below
 (A bass, B bass)
.C            C/B bass Em
 seemed to be suddenly rising
.G         G/F#bass   Asus
 exploding all around 

;Chorus

 We were falling
 down this crevice
 about about a mile down it seem
 and I looked down
 And I see this red thing below us coming up real fast
 and it's our reflection that's
 this little pool of water about six feet wide and one foot deep
 We're falling down right through it
 We hit, we splashed it dry
 that's when I lost my hold
 and she got away
 but I'm gonna try and get her again some day

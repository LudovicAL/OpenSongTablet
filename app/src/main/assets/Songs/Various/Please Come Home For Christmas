;Intro:
.AEF# C#
    

;Verse 1:
.               A     Amaj7              A7
 Bells will be ringing     the sad, sad news
.            D                   B7/D#
 Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
.           A   D             A    A/G# F#m
 My baby's gone   I have no friends
.            B7              E  E+
 To wish me greetings once again

;Verse 2:
 Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
 Christmas carols by candlelight
 Please come home for Christmas, please come home for Christmas
.            B7       E7                A   A7
 If not for Christmas,   by New Year's night

;Bridge:
.               D               Dm
 Friends and relations send salutations
.A            E+           A  A7
 Sure as the stars shine above
.               D                      Dm
 But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
.            B7                           E  E+
 The time of year to be with the one you love

;Verse 3:
 So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
 Christmas and New Year's will find you home
.                      A    C#7               F#m F#m/E D B7/D#
 There'll be no more sorrow,    no grief and pain         
.             A    F#m      B7     E7    A
 And I'll be happy,    (1: happy) once again
 (2: Christmas)

;Repeat verse 3 with guitar solo over first two lines

;Outro:
.      A   D     A   A E F# C#

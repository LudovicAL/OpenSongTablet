.Am        D
 A dying flame
.Bm          Em
 you're free again
.Am7       D
 who could love
.G
 and do that to you.

.Am7             D
 All dressed in black
.Bm             Em
 he won't be coming back.
.Am7       D
 Save your tears
.Esus4                  E7
 you've got years and years.

.Am7            D
 The pains of seventeens
.Bm                Em
 unreal, they're only dreams.
.Am7           D
 Save your crying
.        Esus4 E7
 for the day.

[C]
.Am7                     D
 Fool, if you think it's over,
.G                  Em
 'cos you said goodbye.
.Am7                     D
 Fool, if you think it's over,
.              Esus4 E7
 I'll tell you why.

.Am7                  D
 New born eyes always cry with pain
.       G                         Em
 at the first look at the morning sun
.Am7                     D
 Fool, if you think it's over,
.            Esus4 E7
 it's just begun.

.Am           D
 Miss teenage dream
.Bm             Em
 Such a tragic scene
.Am7             D
 he knocked your crown
.G
 and ran away.

.Am7             D
 First wound of pride
.Bm             Em
 but how you cried and cried
.Am7           D
 but save your tears
.Esus4            E7
 you've years and years.

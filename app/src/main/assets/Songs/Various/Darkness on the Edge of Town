 INTRO: G   C G      C G

.G                                    C
 Well they're still racing out at the Trestles
.              G                       C
 But that blood it never burned in her veins
.          G                         C
 Now I hear she's got a house up in Fairview
.           G                     C
 And a style she's trying to maintain

.G       C               G   Em
 Well if she wants to see me 
.        G             C
 You can tell her that I'm easily found
.G                C                G        Em
 Tell her there's a spot out `neath Abram's Bridge
.        D                          Dm7     C    D
 Tell her there's a darkness on the edge of town 
.                          C G     C
 There's a darkness on the edge of town

.G                   C
 Everybody's got a secret Sonny
.    G                              C
 Something that they just can't face
.                 G                               C
 Some folks spend their whole lives trying to keep it
.              G                                  C
 They carry it with them every step that they take

.    G         C                G     Em
 Till some day they just cut it loose 
.       G            C              G Em
 Cut it loose or let it drag `em down 
.             G        C
 Where no one asks any questions
.            G        Em
 Or looks too long in your face
.D                      Dm7     C   D
 In the darkness on the edge of town
.                          C G     C
 There's a darkness on the edge of town

 Some folks are born into a good life
 Other folks get it anyway anyhow
 I lost my money and I lost my wife
 Them things don't seem to matter much to me now
 Tonight I'll be on that hill `cause I can't stop
 I'll be on that hill with everything I got
 Lives on the line where dreams are found and lost
 I'll be there on time and I'll pay the cost
 For wanting things that can only be found
 In the darkness on the edge of town

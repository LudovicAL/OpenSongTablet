;The Mamas and the Papas
.                   Am   G   F         G      Bm7      E7
 All the leaves are brown      and the sky is grey     
.F               C   E7     Am                   E    E7
 I've been for a walk           on a winter's day     

.                   Am  G   F        G        Bm7    E7
 I'd be be safe and warm        if I was in L.A.     
.           Am      G     F       G               Bm7  E7
 California dreaming           on such a winter's day  

.               Am    G   F          G        Bm7     E7
 Stopped into a church     I passes along the way     
.     F              C    E7   Am        F       E      E7
 Oh I got down on my knees      and I pretend to pray   
.                                Am     G   F
 You know the preacher likes the cold,      
.         G         Bm7    E7
 he knows I'm gonna stay   
.           Am      G     F  G               Bm7  E7
 California dreaming      on such a winter's day  

.                   Am   G   F         G      Bm7      E7
 All the leaves are brown      and the sky is grey     
.F               C   E7     Am                 E    E7
 I've been for a walk         on a winter's day     

.            Am      G    F        G       Bm7    E7
 If I didn't tell her      I could leave today    
.           Am      G    F
 California dreaming     
.   G               Bm7  E7 F
 on such a winter's day     
.   G               Am   G    F
 on such a winter's day       
.   G               Fmaj7G    Cmaj7
 on such a winter's day</lyrics>

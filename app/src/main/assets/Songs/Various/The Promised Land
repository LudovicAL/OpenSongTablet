 INTRO (Harmonica) G   C G  Em C    G

.     G                           Em
 On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert
.  C                                   G
 I pick up my money and head back into town
.                                Em
 Driving cross the Waynesboro county line
.          C                             G
 I got the radio on and I'm just killing time
.Em                    G
 Working all day in my daddy's garage
.Em                        Am
 Driving all night chasing some mirage
.C                             D7
 Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge

[C
.    G                                    C    G
 The dogs on Main Street howl `cause they understand
.           Em       C              G
 If I could take one moment into my hands
.                          C     G
 Mister I ain't a boy,  no I'm a man
.    Em  C                   G
 And I believe in a promised land
[

 I've done my best to live the right way
 I get up every morning and go to work each day
 But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold
 Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode
 Explode and tear this town apart
 Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart
 Find somebody itching for something to start

 The dogs on Main Street...

 There's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor
 I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm
 Gonna be a twister to blow everything down
 That ain't got the faith to stand its ground
 Blow away the dreams that tear you apart
 Blow away the dreams that break your heart
 Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted

 The dogs on Main Street...
.            G         Em  C                     G         Em  C
...Promised Land, and I believe in the Promised Land, and I believe
.                G
 in the Promised Land.</lyrics>

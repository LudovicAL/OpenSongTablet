;Intro
.Dm       C      G      Dm       C      Bb
                                        
.Dm       C      G      Dm       C      G
                                        
.Dm       C      G      Dm       C      Bb
                                        

.Bm                           E          A
 Oh what a feeling I get when I'm with you
.Bm                           E        A
 You take my heart into everything you do
.        Bb      C            Am      Bb
 And it makes me sad for the lonely people
.Gm              C         Dm
 I walked that road for so long
.        Bb        C             Am      Bb
 Now I know that I'm one of the luckly people
.Gm              C       G
 Your love is making me strong

;Chorus

.Dm              C   Dm
 I've had enough bad love
.        Dm        C             G
 I need something I can be proud of
.Dm              C    Dm
 I've had enough bad love
.Dm      C       Bb
 No more bad love

.Bm                    E                A
 And now I see that my life has been so lue
.Bm                              E        A
 With all the heartaches I had till I met you
.        Bb      C               Am  Bb
 But I'm glad to say now that's all behind me
.Gm        C         Dm
 With you here by my side
.            Bb          C    Am    Bb
 And there's no more memories to remind me
.Gm              C       G
 Your love will keep me alive

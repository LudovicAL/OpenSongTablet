.A                         F#m  A                            F#m
 Instant Karma's gonna get you, gonna knock you right on the head
.A                         F#m     F                  G        A
 You better get yourself together, pretty soon you're gonna be dead
.D                              Bm  D                       Bm
 What in the world you thinking of, laughing in the face of love
.C                           Am7      D               E9
 What on earth you tryin' to do, it's up to you, yeah you

.A                         F#m  A                           F#m
 Instant Karma's gonna get you, gonna look you right in the face
.A                         F#m             F        G     A
 You better get yourself together darling, join the human race
.D                          Bm   D                      Bm
 How in the world you gonna see, laughing at fools like me
.C                            Am7    D                 E7
 Who on earth d'you think you are? A superstar? Well alright you are

;Chorus
.        G   Bm    Em          G            Bm            Em
 Well we all shine on like the moon and the stars and the sun
.        G   Bm    Em D          E9
 Well we all shine on every one, come on

.A                         F#m  A                       F#m
 Instant Karma's gonna get you, gonna knock you of your feet
.A                     F#m       F     G       A
 Better recognize your brothers, every one you meet
.D                       Bm    D                              Bm  Bm7
 Why in the world are we here? Surely not to live in pain and fear
.C                    Am                 D                    Em7
 Why on earth are you there? When you're everywhere, come and get your share

;Chorus

.A        F#m    A   F#m    A  F#m       C  G A
 Yeah yeah     alright      Ah haa       Aaaahh

 Baby (heal me, my darling) I got sick this morning
 A sea was storming inside me
 Baby (heal me , my darling) I think I'm capsizing
 The waves are rising and rising

 And when I get that feeling, I want sexual healing
 Sexual healing is good for me,
 Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
 Helps to relieve the mind, it's good for us
 Sexual healing baby, is good for me
 Sexual healing is something that is good for me

.Eb                    Cm                       Ab      Cm Bb Ab Bb
 And it's good for me, and it's so good to me , my baby    
 Come take control, just grab a hold of my body and mind/soul
 You're my medicine, open up and let me in
 Darling, you're so great, I can't wait for you to operate

;chorus
 Heal me, my darling, heal me, my darling
;repeat 'till fade, ad lib improvisation</lyrics>

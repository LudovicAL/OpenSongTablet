.G    D    G    D
                
.            G            Em    G7         C   Cm         G
 There are places I'll remember    all my li--ife though some have changed,
.        G             Em    G7            C   Cm      G
 Some forever not for better,    some have go--one and some remain.
.            Em              C             F                     G
 All these places had their moments, with lovers and friends I still can recall,
.          Em                A7        Cm            G             D
 Some are dead and some are living, in my life I've loved them all.

.        G                     Em    G7          C  Cm      G
 But of all these friends and lovers,   there is no one compares with you,
.           G                   Em     G7          C       Cm      G
 And these memories lose their meaning,   when I think of love as something new.
.          Em                     C           F                      G
 Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before,
.   Em                              A7           Cm            G            D
 I know I'll often stop and think about them, in my life I'll love you more.

 Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before,
.   Em                              A7           Cm            G            D
 I know I'll often stop and think about them, in my life I'll love you more.
.   Cm                     G   D D7 G
 In my life I'll love you more.</lyrics>

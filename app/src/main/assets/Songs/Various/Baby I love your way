.   G                Bm          Em                C        F7
 Shadows grow so long before my eyes, and they're moving, across the page
.   G            Bm            Em   C                   F7
 Suddenly the day turns into night, far away, from the city
.    Bm         E7                Am          D7
 But don't, hesitate, cause your love, won't wait

[C]
.G       D                   Am
    Ooh, baby I love your way
.G       D                   Am
    Wanna tell you I love your way
.G       D                   Am
    Wanna be with you night and day

. G                  Bm                Em            C             F7
 Moon appears to shine, and light the sky, with the help, of some firefly
. G               Bm                  Em
 Wonder how they have, the power to shine, shine, shine
.        C         F7
 I can see them, under the pine
.    Bm         E7                Am          D7
 But don't, hesitate, cause your love, won't wait

;Chorus

.G              Bm             Em              C         F7
 I can see the sunset in your eyes, brown and grey, and blue besides
.G                  Bm                 Em                C               F7
 Clouds are stalking islands in the sun, I wish I could buy one, out of season
.    Bm         E7                Am          D7
 But don't, hesitate, cause your love, won't wait

.F                                      C
 Loving you Isn't the right thing to do 
.Bb                                      F Fsus9
 How can I ever change things That I feel  

.F                                      C
 If I could Maybe I'd give you my world 
.Bb                                      F Fsus9
 How can I When you won't take it from me  

[C]
;chorus
.Dm      Bb          C
 You can go your own way        (Go your own way)
.Dm      Bb        C
 You can call it another lonely day (Another lonely day)
.Dm      Bb          C
 You can go your own way        (Go your own way)

 Tell me why Everything turned around
 Packing up Shacking up is all you wanna do

 If I could Baby I'd give you my world
 Open up Everything's waiting for you

.Amaj7                B/A           Cdim
  Little man with his  eyes on fire 
.                 C#m7    B7
 And his smile so  bright 
.Amaj7                 B/A            Cdim
  In his hands are the  toys you gave 
.                           C#m7  B7
 That fill his heart with delight 
.Amaj7               B/A           Cdim
  In a ring stands a  circus clown 
.             C#m7   B7
 Holding up a  light 
.Amaj7             B/A            Cdim
  What you see and  what you hear 
.                               C#m7  B7
 Will last you the rest of your  life 

.Amaj72             
  It's sad, so sad B7
.Cdim                    C#m7   B7
  There aint no easy way  round 
.Amaj72             
  It's sad, so sad F#7
.Bmin7                    Amaj7
  All your friends gather  round
.           Dmaj7             Amaj7
 'Cause the  circus left town 

 Little man with his heart so pure
 And his love so fine
 Stick with me and I'll ride with you
 Till the end of the line
 Hold my hand and I'll walk with you
 Through the darkest night
 When I smile I'll be thinking of you
 And everything will be alright</lyrics>

.   C             G
 I follow the Moskva
.  Dm            C
 Down to Gorky Park
.    C             G        F      G
 Listening to the wind of cha------nge
 An August summer night
 Soldiers passing by
 Listening to the wind of change

 The world is closing in
 Did you ever think
 That we could be so close, like brothers
 The future's in the air
 I can feel it everywhere
 Blowing with the wind of change

. C      G         Dm           G
 Take   me to the magic of the moment
.       C     G
 On a glory night
.                Dm           G          C
 Where the children of tomorrow dream away
.                  G
 In the wind of change

 Walking down the street
 Distant memories
 Are buried in the past forever
 I follow the Moskva
 Down to Gorky Park
 Listening to the wind of change

 Take me to the magic of the moment
 On a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams

 With you and me
 Take me to the magic of the moment
 On a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow dream away
 In the wind of change

.     Am
 The wind of change
.        Dm                       Am
 Blows straight into the face of time
.                           Dm
 Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
.              Am
 For peace of mind
.                    Dm
 Let your balalaika sing
.                        E
 What my guitar want to say

 Take me to the magic of the moment
 On a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
 With you and me
 Take me to the magic of the moment
 On a glory night
 Where the children of tomorrow dream away
 In the wind of change</lyrics>

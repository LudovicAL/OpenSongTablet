;AC/DC
;Intro and riff: A     D/F#   G     D/F#   G     D/F#   G  D/F#     A
;Keep playing the riff for the verses; end last line on an E chord

 It ain't easy living free
 Season ticket on a one-way ride
 Asking nothin' leave me be
 Taking everything in my stride
 Don't need reason don't need rhyme
 Ain't nothin' that I'd rather do
 Goin' down party time
 My friends are gonna be there too

;Chorus
.         A          D    G  D
 I'm on a highway to hell    
.     A          D    G  D
 On a highway to hell    
.A          D    G  D
 Highway to hell    
.         A          D
 I'm on a highway to hell

 No stop signs speed limit
 Nobody's gonna slow me down
 Like wheel gonna spin it
 Nobody's gonna mess me around
 Hey satan paid my dues
 Hey I'm in a rockin band
 Hey mama look at me
 I'm on my way to the promised land

;Chorus

;Break:
.D    Dsus4D    D              Dsus4D    Dsus4D
                Don't stop me                 

;Chorus
 I'm on a highway to hell
 On a highway to hell
 I'm on a highway to hell
 On a highway to...

 Highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 Highway to hell
 I'm on a highway to hell
 and I'm goin down all the way
 Whoa I'm on a highway to hell</lyrics>

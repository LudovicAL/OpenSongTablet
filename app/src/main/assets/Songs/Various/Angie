.Am     E     G               F               C
 Angie, Angie when will those clouds all disappear?
.Am     E     G               F            C
 Angie, Angie where will they lead us from here?
.        G                          Dm           Am
 With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
.C         F              G
 You can't say we're satisfied
.Am     E     G         F            C
 Angie, Angie you can't say we never tried

.Am            E         G            F                C
 Angie, you're beautiful but ain't it time we said goodbye
.Am             E        G        F                   C
 Angie, I still love you remember all those nights we cried
.        G                               Dm           Am
 All the dreams we held so close seem to all go up in smoke
.C         F               G
 Oh let me whisper in your ear
.Am     E     G               F            C
 Angie, Angie where will they lead us from here?

;piano solo

.   G                             Dm                 Am
 Oh Angie don't you weep all your kisses still taste sweet
.C           F               G
 I hate that sadness in your eyes
.    Am     E     G        F                C
 But Angie, Angie ain't it time we said goodbye?

;strings

.        G                          Dm           Am
 With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
.C            F              G
 Oh you can't say we're satisfied
.    Am                      E    G            F               C
 But Angie, I still love you baby everywhere I look I see your eyes
.Dm                             Am           C       F             G
 There ain't a woman that comes close to you come on baby dry your eyes
.Am     E     G        F           C
 Angie, Angie ain't it good to be alive
.Am     E     G          F            F E Dm  C
 Angie, Angie they can't say we never tried</lyrics>

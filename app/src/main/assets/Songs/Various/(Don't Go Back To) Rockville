.E                                                               A     Asus4
 Looking at your watch a third time waiting in the station for a bus   
.E                                                           A       Asus4
 Going to a place that's far, so far away and if that's not enough   
.B-VII         A-V  G#m     C#m-IV                         Bm         A      Asus4
 Going where nobody says hello, they don't talk to anybody they don't know   

.       E                                                                  A
 You'll wind up in some factory that's full time filth and nowhere left to go
.E                                                  A      Asus4
 Walk home to an empty house, sit around all by yourself   
.  B-VII               A-V          G#m   C#m-IV                        Bm       A      Asus4
 I know it might sound strange, but I   believe you'll be coming back before too long   

[C
.E                F#m   B     Bsus
 Don't go back to Rockville   
.E                F#m   B     Bsus
 Don't go back to Rockville   
.E                F#m   B     Bsus
 Don't go back to Rockville   
.A
 And waste another year

.   E                                                                    A              Asus4
 At night I drink myself to sleep and pretend I don't care if you're not here with me   
.            E                                                       A            Asus4
 'Cause it's so much easier to handle all my problems if I'm too far out to sea   
.    B-VII            A-V    G#m     C#m-IV                    Bm        A
 But something better happen soon or it's gonna be too late to bring you back

;Chorus

.E                           F#m  B      A   B
 It's not as though I really need you        
.E                         F#m   B      A   B
 If you were here I'd only leave you        
.F#m      C#m-IV       F#m       C#m-IV             A                                   B
 But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down and that's not how it ought to be

.  B-VII               A-V          G#m   C#m-IV                        Bm       A      Asus4
 I know it might sound strange, but I   believe you'll be coming back before too long   

;Chorus 2x

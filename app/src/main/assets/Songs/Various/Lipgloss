;1st VERSE
.Dm                                  C                G
 No wonder you're looking thin when all that you live on
.    C        G        Dm
 is lipgloss and cigarrettes and scraps at the end of the day
.           C         G       C            G          Dm
 when he's given the rest to someone with long black hair
.                                   C           G
 all those nights in making such a mess of the bed
.         C         G            Dm
 oh you never ever wanted to go home he says he wants you so you may as well
.        C           G              C           G     F
 hang around for a while call your Dad on the phone Oh
.F                               Fm                                C
 He changed his mind last monday  so you've gotta leave by Sunday yeah
.                     Em                 C
 Oh you've lost your lipgloss honey  oh yeah
.                Em              F
 Now nothing you do can turn him on there's something wrong
.     Fm
 you had it once but now it's gone

;SECOND VERSE
 And you feel such a fool
 for laughing at bad jokes
 and putting up with all of his friends
 and kissing in public
 what are they gonna say
 when they bump into you again
 that your stomach looks bigger
 and your eyes are just holes in your face
 and it rains every day
 but when it doesn't
 the sun makes you feel worse anyway

;Chorus again
.G                            C
    Though you knew there was no way
.        F              G
 it was going to last forever it still shook you
.         C              F                           Fm
 when he told you in a letter that he didn't want to see you
.                              C
 you nearly lost your mind oh yeah

;You've lost your lipgloss... etc, to end</lyrics>

 From the mountain tops down to the sunny street,
.G13                            F        E7
 A different drum is playing a different kind of beat.

 It's like a mystery that never ends,

 I hear your footsteps in the street,

 It's obvious.

 Just count me in and count me out and
.                         Bm  Bm aug
 I'll be waiting for the shout,
.Bm7      E7
 Oblivious...

.G13                            F                  E7
 Got different badges but they wear them just the same.
.Am                       G                Ebdim      F#dim
 But down by the ballroom I recognized that flaming fountain
.          Adim           E7       
 In those kindred caring eyes.

 I hope it haunts me 'til I'm hopeless,

 I hope it hits you when you go,
.Ama7                          Bma7
 And sometimes on the edge of sleeping
.F                      E7
 It rises up to let me know it's not so deep,
              Ama7 (begin the entire Chorus part with guitar solo over it)
 I'm not so slow.

.G13                                 F          E7
 They'll call us lonely when we're really just alone.
.Am                    G
 And like a funny film, it's kinda cute
 
 They've bought the bullets and there's no one left to shoot.

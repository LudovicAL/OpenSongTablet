.            Em                  G
 Well, she's walkin' through the clouds
.       Am                         Em
 with a circus mind that's running  wild
.Bm                         Bb        Am
 Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams 
.             G
 and uh fairy tales
.       F(add9)
 That's all she ever thinks about
.C                D
  Riding with the wind

.         Em               G
 When I'm sad she comes to me
.       Am                              Em7
 with a thousand smiles she gives to me free
.Bm                     Bb
  It's alright she says It's alright
.Am    C                G        F(add9)
  Take anything you want from me 
.         C
 anything 
.D
 anything

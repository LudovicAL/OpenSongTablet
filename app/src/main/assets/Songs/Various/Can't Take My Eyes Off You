;intro:

.F#7/E      Am6/E        E      (2x)
                                

.                 E
 You're just too good to be true
.              Emaj7
 Can't take my eyes off of you
.               E7
 You'd be like heaven to touch
.        A/E
 I wanna hold you so much
.             Am6/E
 At long last love has arrived
.             E
 And I thank God I'm alive
.                F#7/E
 You're just too good to be true
.Am6/E          E
 Can't take my eyes off of you

 Pardon the way that I stare
 There's nothing else to compare
 The sight of you leaves me weak
 There are no words left to speak
 So if you feel like I feel
 Please let me know that it's real
 You're just too good to be true
 Can't take my eyes off of you

;break:

.F#m7    B7        Emaj7
                   

;chorus:
[C]
.           F#m9              B7
 I love you baby and if it's quite all right
.           G#m7              C#m7
 I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
.           F#m7  B7                Emaj7 C#7#9
 I love you baby, trust in me when I say  
.          F#m9                  B7
 Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray
.          G#m7                C#m7
 Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you stay
.           F#m7                   D9
 And let me love you baby, let me love you

.G     D         F               C
 Wanna tell you 'bout the girl I love
.C
 My she looks so fine
.G         D             F               C
 She's the only one that I been dreamin' of
.C                  C7
 Maybe someday she will be all mine
;etc...
 I wanna tell her that I love her so
 I thrill with her every touch
 I need to tell her she's the only one I really love

;CHORUS
;riff: G  G  x  F  CxC
 I got a woman, wanna ball all day
.riff
 I got a woman, she won't be true, no
.riff
 I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
.riff
 I said I got a little woman and she won't be true

.G      D               F          C
 Sunday morning when we go down to church
.C
 See the menfolk standin' in line
 I said they come to pray to the Lord
 With my little girl, looks so fine
 In the evening when the sun is sinkin' low
 Everybody's with the one they love
 I walk the town
 Keep a-searchin' all around:
 Lookin' for my street corner girl

;CHORUS

.G      D              F            C
 In the bars, with the men who play guitars
.C
 Singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times
 My little lover does a midnight shift
 She followed around all the time
 I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do
 Gonna pack my bags and move on my way
 Cause I got a worried mind
 Sharin' what I thought was mine
 Gonna leave her where the guitars play

 I got a woman, she won't be true, no no
 I got a woman, wanna ball all day
 I got a woman, stay drunk all the time
 I got a little woman and she won't be true

 (hey hey what can I do)

 I said she won't be true

 (Hey Hey, What can I say?)

;RIFF at same time of lyrics
 Hey hey, what can I do
.C
 I got a woman, she won't be true
.riff
 Lo-o-ord, hear what I say
.C
 I got a woman, wanna ball all day</lyrics>

.Em     D        Em      D       Em      D       Em
 Lyin'  in my    bed I hear the  clock tick and  think of you
.Em     D        Em      D       Em      D       Em
 Caught up in     circles       confu-sion is    nothing new.
.G     A       F#m     G          A       F#m
 Flashback,    warm nights,    almost left behind__.
.G     A       F#m     G          A11
 Suitcase of    memories        time after,
.Em     D        Em     D        Em      D       Em         D
 Sometimes you  picture me I'm     walking too      far ahead_
 You're calling    to   me I      can't hear what you've said.
.    G    A       F#m    G          A       F#m
 Then you say       go slow__       I fall behind__
.G   A             F#m    G
 The second hand_    unwinds__
;Chorus
[C
.           A                         Bm       G        G    A      D
 If you're lost you can look and you will find me       Time After Time__
 If  you  fall I will catch you  I'll be waiting       Time After Time__
[

;repeat chorus

.Em     D        Em      D       Em      D       Em        D
 After my        picture fades and darkness has turned to grey
.Em     D        Em      D       Em      D       Em        D
 Watching through windows you're wondering if    I'm   O. K.
.G     A       F#m      G          A       F#m
 Secrets__        stolen__      from deep inside_
.G    A         F#m    G
 The drum beats out of time.
;Chorus once

.G        A       F#m    G          A       F#m
.    You say       go slow__       I fall behind__
.G    A             F#m    G
 The second hand_    unwinds__

;Chorus twice
 (repeat "time after time" and fade) (D)

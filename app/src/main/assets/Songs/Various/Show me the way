.D
 I wonder how you're feeling there's ringing in my ears.
.    Bm                           Bb
 And no one to relate to 'cept the sea.
.D
 Who can I believe in ?   I'm  kneeling on the floor.
.      Bm
 There has to be a force.  Who do I phone ?
.    A7sus4                            G7
 The stars are out and shining.  But all I really want to know

.   Bm                    G
 Oh won't you show me the way
.       Bm              G  A7sus4
 I want you show me the way

.D
 Well, I can see no reason.. you living on your nerves
.     Bm                     Bb
 When someone drop a cup and I submerge
.D
 I'm swimming in a circle ... I feel I'm going down
.      Bm                   Bb
 There has to be a fool to play my part
.A7sus4                                  G7
 Someone thought of healing..  But all I really want to know

.D
 I wonder if I'm dreaming  I feel so unashamed
.  Bm                                 Bb
 I can't believe this is happening to me.
 A7sus4
.           G7
 I watch you when you're sleeping
 And then I want to take your love

 Repeat

.Bm                      G
 Oh won't you show me the way
.Bm                   G
 I want you day after day</lyrics>

.       C             F Em            G            C
 Oh, my name it means nothing, and my age it means less
.        G         C    F       Em            Am
 For the country I come from is called the Midwest
.      G                  C  F          C        F   C
 I was taught and brought up there, the laws to abide
.                    F    Em     G  F       C
 And that the land I live in has God on its side

 Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well
 The cavalry charged and the Indians fell
 The cavalry charged and the Indians died
 Oh the country was young then, with God on its side

 The Spanish-American war had its day
 And the Civil War too was soon laid away
 And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
 With guns in their hands and God on their side

 Oh, the first World War, well it came and it went
 And the reason for fighting I never did get
 But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
 For you don't count the dead with God on your side

 When the second World War came to an end
 We forgave the Germans and then we were friends
 Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried
 The Germans now too have God on their side

 I've learned to hate Russians all through my whole life
 If another war comes, it's them we must fight
 To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide
 And accept it all bravely with God on our side

 But now we've got weapons of the chemical dust
 If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must
 One push of the button and a shot the world wide
 And you never ask questions with God on your side

 In many a dark hour I've been thinking about this
 That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss
 But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
 Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side

 So now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell
 The confusion I'm feeling, ain't no tongue can tell
 The words fill my head and fall to the floor
 If God's on our side, He'll stop the next war</lyrics>

.A
 When I die and they lay me to rest,
.                D
 Gonna go to the place that's best.
.                   A
 When they lay me down to die,
.E                               A
 Goin on up to the spirit in the sky.

;Chorus
.A
 Goin on up to the spirit in the sky.
.                           D
 That's where I'm gonna go, when I die.
.                     A
 When I die and they lay me to rest,
.          E
 I'm gonna go to the place that's the best.

;Verse 2
 Prepare yourself, you know it's a must,
 Gotta have a friend in Jesus.
 So you know that when you die,
 It's gonna recommend you to the spirit in the sky.

 CHORUS **replace "I'm" with "you're" and 1st "I" with "you"**

;Verse 3
 Never been a sinner, I've never sinned.
 I've got a friend in Jesus.
 So you know that when I die,
 It's gonna set me up with the spirit in the sky.

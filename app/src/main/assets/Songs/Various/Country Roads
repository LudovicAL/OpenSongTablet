.     D            Bm
 Almost heaven, West Virginia,
.    A                     G        D
 Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
.                     Bm
 Life is old there, older than the trees,
.  A                            G             D
 Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.

;Chorus:
.     D                 A
 Country road, take me home
.         Bm      G
 To the place I belong,
.         D                A
 West Virginia, mountain momma,
.         G             D
 Take me home, country road.

.        D         Bm
 All my mem'ries gather 'round her,
.  A              G               D
 Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
.                   Bm
 Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
.  A                         G              D
 Misty taste of moonshine, tear-drop in my eye.

;Chorus.

.   Bm        A              D
 I hear her voice, in the morning hours she calls me,
.      G           D         A
 The radio reminds me of my home far away.
.       Bm             Em             G
 And driving down the road I get the feeling
.         D                      A          A7
 That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.

;Chorus.

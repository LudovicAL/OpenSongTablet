 Suzanne takes you down
 To her place by the river,
.        Am
 You can hear the boats go by,
 You can spend the night beside her,
.        G
 And you know that she's half crazy,
 And that's why you want to be there;
.        Bm
 And she feeds you tea and oranges
.          C
 That come all the way from China;
.     G
 And just when you mean to tell her
 That you have no love to give her,
.    Am
 She gets you on her wave-length
 And lets the river answer
.            G
 That you've always been her lover.

;Chorus:
.        Bm
 And you want to travel with her,
.        C
 And you want to travel blind,
.        G
 And you know that you can trust her,
.           Am
 For you've touched her perfect body
.          G
 With your mind.

 And Jesus was a sailor
 When He walked upon the water,
 And he spent a long time watching
 From a lonely wooden tower,
 And when he knew for certain
 Only drowning men could see Him,
 He said, "All men shall be brothers, then,
 Until the sea shall free them,"
 But He himself was broken
 Long before the sky would open,
 Forsaken, almost human,
 He sank beneath your wisdom
 Like a stone.

;Chorus:
 And you want to travel with Him,
 And you want to travel blind,
 And you think you maybe trust Him,
 For He's touched your perfect body
 With His mind.

 Suzanne takes you down
 To her place by the river,
 You can hear the boats go by,
 You can spend the night forever,
 And the sun pours down like honey,
 On our lady of the harbour;
 And she shows you where to look
 Amid the garbage and the flowers.
 There are heroes in the seaweed,
 There are children in the morning,
 They are leaning out for love,
 And they will lean that way forever,
 While Suzanne holds the mirror.

;Chorus:
 And you want to travel with her,
 And you want to travel blind,
 And you think maybe you'll trust her,
 For you've touched her perfect body
 With your mind.

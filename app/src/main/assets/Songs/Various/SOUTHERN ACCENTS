 intro: F

.F         Dm  C    F              Dm C   F
 There's a southern accent - where I come from
.    Dm         C       F             Bb              C
 The young 'uns call it country - the yankees call it dumb,
.         Dm  C      F             Bb              C
 I got my own way of talking - but everything gets done,
.       Dm  C    Dm Bb                 F
 With a southern accent - where I come from.

.         Dm         C    F                 Dm     C      F
 Now that drunk tank in Atlanta - is just a motel room to me,
.        Dm        C     F               Bb                  C
 Think I might go work Orlando - if them orange groves don't freeze,
.       Dm  C      F             Bb            C
 Got my own way of working - but everything is run,
.       Dm  C    Dm Bb                 F
 With a southern accent - where I come from.

.Bb                      Dm
 For just a minute there I was dreaming
.Bb                       Dm
 For just a minute it was all so real
.G                         Bb                    F
 For just a minute she was standing there - with me.

.          Dm    C      F                 Dm    C        F
 There's a dream I keep having - where my momma comes to me,
.    Dm          C           F            Bb                C
 And kneels down over by the window - and says a prayer for me,
.       Dm  C      F             Bb               C
 Got my own way of praying - but everything one's begun,
.       Dm  C    Dm Bb                 F
 With a southern accent - where I come from.

.       Dm  C      F             Bb           C
 Got my own way of living - but everything is done,
.       Dm  C    Dm Bb                 F
 With a southern accent - where I come from.</lyrics>

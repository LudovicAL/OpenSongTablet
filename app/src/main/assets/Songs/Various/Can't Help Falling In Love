.F    Am  Dm        Bb    F    C7
 Wise man say, only fools rush in
.    BbC7    F    Gm         F    C7   F
 But I can't help falling in love with you

.F     AmDm             Bb F C7
 Shall I stay, would it be a sin
.   BbC7    F    Gm         F    C7   F
 If I can't help falling in love with you

[C]
.Am           E7    Am            E7
 Like a river flows surely to the sea
.Am            E7    Am       D7              Gm C7
 Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be

 Take my hand, take my whole life too

 For I can't help falling in love with you

 For I can't help falling in love with you
.    BbC7    F    Gm         F    C7   F

 Daddy was a cajun babe
.G
 Raised on Southern land
.G
 Some'uv of my kin folk tell me
.G
 Was a street fightin' man

.C
 Well they rush him down to see the doctor
.C
 Hey! Doctor check his head
.G
 The only thing that was wrong with him was Uncle Johnny's Red
.D
 He drank ol' bootleg whiskey
.                      G
 Until it killed him dead

.G
 Happened back in the bayou baby
.G
 Many year ago.
.G
 Satan came to take him
.G
 And did it real slow

.C
 Well they rushed him down to see the doctor
.C
 The Doctor just shook his head
.G
 20 years of rot gut whiskey done killed this poor man dead
.D
 He drank ol' bootleg whiskey
.                   G
 And it killed him dead

 Take a tip from me people
 Brother, cain't ya see
 Ain't no future in no poison whiskey
 They goin' to rush you down to see the Doctor
 The Doctor goin' to check your head
 The only thing he's goin' to tell you baby
 Stop drinking Johnny Walker's Red

.D
 Don't drink poison whiskey
.C                  G
 Don't you drink it boy</lyrics>

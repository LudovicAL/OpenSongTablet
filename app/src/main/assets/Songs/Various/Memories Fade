.Em                                      Am
 There's only need, I love your need, so much I'm losing me
.  Em                            Am
 I cannot see the reason for the pain
.     Em                                 Am
 With hungry joy, I'll be your toy, just hoping you will play
.    Em                              Am
 Without the hope, my body starts to fail

[C]
.Bm                    B
 Memories fade but the scars still linger
.C                         Am
 Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again
.Bm                    B                        Am
 Memories fade but the scars still linger...    oh.....
[]

.  Em                           Am
 I cannot grow, I canot move, I cannot feel my age
.    Em                                 Am
 The vice like grip of tension holds me fast
.  Em                                Am
 Engulged by you, what can I do when history's my cage
.     Em                         Am
 Look forward to a future in the past

;Chorus

.    Em                               Am
 The more I talk, the more I say, the less you seem to hear
.    Em                            Am
 I'm speechless in a most peculiar way
.     Em                                   Am
 Your mind is weak, your need is great and nothing is too dear
.    Em                           Am
 For you to use to take the pain away

.Bm                    B
 Memories fade but the scars still linger
.C                         Am
 Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again
.Bm       B
 Memories fade ...
.C                        Am
 No don't pretend you can justify the end
.Bm                    B
 Memories fade but the scars still linger

 Little darling,
.             C                  D7
 It's been a long, cold, lonely winter.
.G
 Little darling,
.               C                     D7
 It feels like years since it's been here.

.G
 Here comes the sun.
.C               A7
 Here comes the sun,
.         G                C   G   C   G   D7    G   G7
 And I say, it's all right.                          

 Little darling,
 The smiles returning to their faces.
 Little darling,
 It feels like years since it's been here.

 Here comes the sun.
 Here comes the sun,
 And I say, it's all right.

 Little darling,
 I feel that ice is slowly melting.
 Little darling,
 It feels like years since it's been clear.

 Here comes the sun.
 Here comes the sun,
 And I say, it's all right.

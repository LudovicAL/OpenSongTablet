;opening
.E E D A (4x)
         
.E              D                  E
 Dear Mother, Can you hear me whining?
.E               D             G                 B
 It's been 3 whole weeks since I have left your home
.E              D                    E
 This sudden fear has left me trembling
.E               D              G              B
 'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
. G                     B
 And I'm feeling all alone...

;chorus
[C
.E              G                    A               C
 Pay attention to the cracked streets, and broken homes
.E                    G             B
 Some call it slums, some call it nice...
.E               G                      A                 C
 I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home...
.E                B
 Welcome to Paradise

;intro-seq. twice

.E           D                    E
 A gunshot rings out at the station
.E          D                G               B
 Another urchin snaps, and left dead on his own
.E             D                    E
 It makes me wonder why I'm still here
.E                  D                 G             B
 For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
.          G         B
 And I'm never gonna go...

;chorus
.E

;bridge (bass solo)

.E             D                     E
 Dear Mother, Can you hear me laughing?
.E               D                G                 B
 It's been six whole months since I have left your home
.E             D                    E
 It makes me wonder why I'm still here
.E                   D              G              B
 For some strange reason it's now feeling like my home
.          G         B
 And I'm never gonna go...

;Intro:  E  A

 (Buck plays E on 7th fret, A on 5th fret, I believe)

.              E                      A
 I took a picture that I'll have to send
.             E                      A
 People here are friendly and content
.             E                   A
 People here are colorful and bright
.                    E           A
 The flowers often bloom at night

;chorus:
.        D              C      G
 Amanita is the name           
.                   D                 C     G
 The flowers cover everything               
.                  D                 C      G   A
 The flowers cover everything                   

 There's something here I find hard to ignore
 There's something that I've never seen before
 Amanita is the name they
 Cover over everything

;chorus

;bridge
.G#      A                 E
 Don't look into the sun   
.G#      A                 B
 Don't look into the sun

.Fm                     C7
 I see a red door and I want it painted black
.Fm                   C7
 No colours anymore I want them to turn black
.Fm    Eb      Ab                    Fm
 I     see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
.  Eb      Ab       Eb    Bb
 I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

.Fm                       C7
 I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
.Fm                            C7
 With flowers and my love both never to come back
.Fm    Eb     Ab                   Fm
 I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
.       Eb       Ab   Eb      Bb
 Like a new born baby it just happens every day

.Fm                       C7
 I look inside myself and see my heart is black
.Fm                      C7
 I see my red door and I want it painted black
.Fm    Eb        Ab            Fm
 Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
.         Eb   Ab     Eb      Bb
 It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

.Fm                           C7
 No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
.Fm                             C7
 I could not foresee this thing happening to you
.Fm    Eb     Ab     Eb     Fm
    If I look hard enough into the setting sun
.   Eb        Ab         Eb   Bb               C7
 My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

.                 Fm                  C7
 I wanna see your face painted black, black as night
.  Fm                        C7
 I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
.               Fm                                   C7    Fm
 I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black,  yeah</lyrics>

.       Am
 T'aint no big t'ing
.                 Em
 To wait for the bell to ring
.       Am
 T'aint no big t'ing
.                 Em
 The toll of the bell

. Am            C
 Aggravated - spare for days
.   Em
 I troll downtown the red light place
. Am                  C
 Jump up bubble up - what's in store
. Em
 Love is the drug and I need to score

. Am                        C
 Showing out, showing out, hit and run
. Em
 Boy meets girl where the beat goes on

. Bm
 Stitched up tight, can't shake free
. Em
 Love is the drug got a hook on me

. Am
 Oh oh catch that buzz
. Em
 Love is the drug I'm thinking of

. Bm
 Oh oh can't you see
. Em
 Love is the drug for me

 Late that night I park my car
 Stake my place in the singles bar

 Face to face, toe to toe
 Heart to heart as we hit the floor

 Lumber up limbo down
 The locked embrace, the stumble round

 I say go, she say yes
 Dim the lights, you can guess the rest

 Oh oh catch that buzz
 Love is the drug I'm thinking of

 Oh oh can't you see
 Love is the drug got a hook in me

 Oh oh catch that buzz
 Love is the drug I'm thinking of

 Oh oh can't you see
 Love the drug for me

.Em   D          Em         D
 Ex-friends, ex-lovers and enemies
.Em    D        Em       D          C
 I've got your case in front of me today
.C    D   G    F#m B
 All sewn up       
.Em  D      Em        D
 Ex-bosses you never let me be
.Em D        Em             D             C
 I got your names and your numbers filed away
.C    D     G  F#m B
 I've grown up     
.F#m Bm  F#m Bm
 See me      
.F#m  Bm  F#m Bm
 Hear me      
.C
 Don't you know you can't get near me.
.D                                     Em D
 You can only hope to hear me on your radio
.         Em D
 On your radio
.C                             D G
 You're gonna hear me on your radio.

 Ex-teachers still coming through to me
 Tough kids don't stop trying to kick me to the ground
 I don't care
 Go on just do what you do to me
 You look so sick when you're pushing me around
 You're nowhere

 See me, etc.</lyrics>

.              C     C7            F
 Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
.           Ab7 G7             C
 You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
.    G7          C    C7              F
 But sleep won't come the whole night through
.          Ab7 G7                 C
 Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

;Chorus
.     C7         F                 C
 When tears come down like falling rain
.             D7                G7
 You'll toss around and call my name
.               C               F
 You'll walk to floor the way I do
.          Ab7 G7                 C
 Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

.              C     C7             F
 Your cheatin' heart will pine some day
.          Ab7 G7             C
 And crave the love you threw away
.              C    C7             F
 The time will come when you'll be blue
.          Ab7 G7                 C
 Your cheatin' heart will tell on you</lyrics>

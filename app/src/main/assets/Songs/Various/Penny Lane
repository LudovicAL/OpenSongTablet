  <lyrics>[V1]
.      G                Em             Am7        D7
 Penny Lane: there is a barber showing photographs
.         G                 Em          Gm7
 Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
.            Em7-5                Eb
 And all the people that come and go
.         D7        C
 Stop and say hello.
[C]
.      F                         Am7  Bb
 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
.F                         Am7   Bb
 Wet beneath the blue suburban skies,
.          Cdim      D7
 I sit and meanwhile:
[V2]
 On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
 The little children laugh at him behind his back.
 And the banker never wears a "mac"
 In the pouring rain.
;Chorus
[V3]
 Back in Penny Lane: there is a fireman with an hourglass.
 And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.
 He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
 It's a clean machine.
;Chorus
[V4]
 Back in Penny Lane: the barber shaves another customer.
 We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trend.
 And then the fireman rushes in
 From the pouring rain.
;Chorus
[C2]
.      G                         Bm7 C
 Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
.G                         Bm7   C
 Wet beneath the blue suburban skies.</lyrics>

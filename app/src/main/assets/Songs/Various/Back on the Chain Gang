.               DAGGDAGG
 Opening strum:        

;riff x2

.D         A            G     G
 I found a picture of you   oh
 What hijacked my world at nights
 To a place in the past we've been passed out of  oh
 Now we're back in the fight

.Em                A
 We're back on the train (ooh, ah)
 Ohh
.A               D         A G G
     Back on the chain gang

 The circumstance beyond our control oh
 The fool on TV and the news of the world
 Got in the house like a pigeon from hell, oh
 Crescending our eyes and descended like flies

 Put us back on the train, yeah
 Oh
 Back on the chain gang

.D A G G
       
;riff x2

;bridge:
 Dm A Dm A and so on
 The powers that be
 That forces us to live like we do
 Bring me to my knees
 When I see what they've done to you

 chord comping

 I'll die as I stand here today
 Knowing that deep in my heart
.A                     Dm
 Therefore to ruin one day
.A             E
 For making us part-----

.E         B          A    A
 I found a picture of you, oh
 Those were the happiest days of my life
 Like a brick in the baggle was your part, oh
 In the wretched life of a lonely heart

.F#m                   B
 Now we're back on the train
 Ohh
.B             E
   Back on the chain gang

.E B E B
          until end</lyrics>

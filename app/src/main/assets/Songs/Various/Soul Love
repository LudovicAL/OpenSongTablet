.G                                          Em                                       C
 Stone love, she kneels before the grave, a brave son, who gave his life to save the slogan
.                                          G    Bm                     Am  D
 That hovers between the headstone and her eyes     for they penetrate her grieving

.G                                     Em
 New love, a boy and girl are talking, new words, that only they can share in
.C                                                    G     Bm                     Am          D
 New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts to sleep   through the fleeting hours of morning

;Chorus
.Am                                Em
 Love is careless in its choosing, sweeping over cross a baby
.F                C                  D
 Love descends on those defenseless, idiot love will spark the fusion
.C            D                    Dm                C
 Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
.Cm               G                 D
 All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving

.A                                              F#m
 Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and told of love, and how my God on high is
.D                                             A      C#m                      Bm           E
 All love, though reaching up my lonliness evolves       by the blindness that surrounds him

;Chorus
.Bm                                F#m
 Love is careless in its choosing, sweeping over cross a baby
.G                D                  E
 Love descends on those defenseless, idiot love will spark the fusion
.D            E                    Em                D
 Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
.Dm               A                 E
 All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving</lyrics>

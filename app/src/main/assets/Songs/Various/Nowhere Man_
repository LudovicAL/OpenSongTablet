.C           G
 He's a real nowhere man,
.F              C
 Sitting in his nowhere land,
.F              Fm                F   C    Bb   F     C
 Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.             

.C              G
 Doesn't have a point of view,
.F                    G
 Knows not where he's going to,
.F          Fm               F    C      Bb     F    C
 Isn't he a bit like you and me?                     

.         Em         F
 Nowhere man, please listen,
.          Em               F
 You don't know what you're missing,
.        Em       F                      G7
 Nowhere man, the world is at your command.

.C                G
 He's as blind as he can be,
.F                 C
 Just sees what he wants to see,
.F               Fm            F      C     Bb   F      C
 Nowhere man can you see me at all?                     

.C              G
 Doesn't have a point of view,
.F                    C
 Knows not where he's going to,
.F          Fm               F     C       Bb    F       C
 Isn't he a bit like you and me?                         

.        Em         F
 Nowhere man, don't worry,
.          Em          F
 Take your time, don't hurry,
.         Em        F                         G7
 Leave it all 'till somebody else lends you a hand.

.C           G
 He's a real nowhere man,
.F              C
 Sitting in his nowhere land,
.F              Fm                F   C
 Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
.F              Fm                C
 Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.</lyrics>

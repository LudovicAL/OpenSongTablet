.D               G     D
 Is it a kind of dream 
.Bm                  G    D
 floating out on the tide 
.A                      D         G         Em7     A
 Following the river of death downstream oh is it a dream
.A7        D               G     D
 There's a fog along the horizon 
.  Bm                  G   D
 a strange glow in the sky 
.    A                    D         G                   F#
 and nobody seems to know where you go and what does it mean
.G#dim D A7    D
 oh oh is it a dream

;Chorus
.       F#m  G            A7
 Bright eyes burning like fire
.       F#m  G                          Em
 Bright eyes how can you close and fail 
.F#7         Bm         A7        D
 How can the light that burned so brightly
.G                Em   A7     D
 suddenly burn so pale bright eyes

.D               G      D
 Is it a kind of shadow 
.Bm                   G     D
 reaching out for the night 
.A                  D       G       Em7     A
 Wandering over the hills unseen or is it a dream
.A7        D                G     D
 There's a high wind in the trees 
.  Bm                G   D
 a cold sound in the air 
.    A                 D        G                   F#
 and nobody ever knows when you go and where do you start
.G#dim D A7     D
 oh oh into the dark

;Chorus

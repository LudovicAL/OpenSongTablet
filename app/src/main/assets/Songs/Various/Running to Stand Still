;Played with D harmonica

.D                            G
 So she woke up, woke up from where she was, lyin' still
.      D                                         G
 Said "I, I gotta do somethin' about where we're goin'"
.D
 Stepped on steam train
.G
 Stepped out of the driving rain, maybe
.D                             G
 Run from the darkness, in the night.

[C
;Chorus
.        A
 Singing Ah,
.         G
 Ah-la-la-la-de-day
.A        G
 Ah-la-la-la-de-day
.      D
 Ah-la-la-de-day

.D                         G
 Sweet the sin, bitter the taste in my mouth
.D                              G
 I see seven towers, but I only see one way out
.          D
 You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking
.G
 scream without raising your voice
.                    D
 You know I took the poison
.                               G
 From the poison stream, then I floated, out of here

;Chorus

.D                      G
 Oooooooooooo,  Ooo Ooo Ooo  Oooooo
.D                      G
 Oooooooooooo,  Ooo Ooo Ooo  Oooooo

.D
 She runs through the streets with eyes painted red
.G
 Under a black belly of clouds in the rain
.D
 in through a doorway, she brings me
.G
 white gold and pearls stolen from the sea
.       D                        G
 she is raging she is raging and storm blows up in her eyes

.          A
 She will, 
.           G              A
 suffer the needle chill,  
.              G         D
 She's running to stand, still.

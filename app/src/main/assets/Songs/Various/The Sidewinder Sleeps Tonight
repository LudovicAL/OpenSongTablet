.D   G C Am

;F, C, and A's are barre chords

.F                                   C
 This here is the place where I will stay in
.      F
 There isn't a number, you can call the pay phone
.C                                 F
 Let it ring a long long long long time
.                             Am                C                F    C
 If I don't pick up, hang up, call back, let it ring some more,  Ohhhhhhh...
.   F                                        Am                          C
 If I don't pick up, pick up, the sidewinder sleeps, sleeps, sleeps in a coil

.D                    G            C       G         Am
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her
.D                    G            C       G         Am
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her
.D                    G            C       G         Am
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her

.C    Em
 Ohhhh.....(Play using above riff)

.          F                        F
 There are scratches all around the coin slot
.                  C
 Like a heart beat baby trying to wake up
.F                         C
 But this machine can only swallow money

 you can't lay a patch by computer design
.F                 Am          C
 Just a lot of stupid, stupid signs

.F          C
 Tell her (yodeled)
.F                        C                                   F
 Tell her she can kiss my ass and laugh and say that you were only kidding
.                                   Am                                C
 That way she'll know that it was really, really, really, really me me

.D                    G            C       G         Am
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her
.D                    G            C       G         Am
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her
.D                    G            C       G         Am         C Em
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her

.      F
 Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me
.      C
 Today I need something more sub, stop, sub, sub, substantial
.F                                          C
 A can of beans or black eyed peas, some Nescafe and ice
.F                                      Am               C
 Candy bar, a fallen star, or a reading from Doctor Suess

.D                    G            C       G         Am
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her
.D                    G            C       G         Am
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her
.D                    G            C       G         Am         C Em
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her

;Bridge:

.Bm                            Am                     Bm
 The cat in the hat came back, wrecked a lot of havoc on the way.
.                                    Am
 Always had a smile, never reason to pretend,
.          Bm                                Am                   C
 Their world has flat backgrounds and little need to sleep but to dream
.               Em
 The sidewinder sleeps on his back

.D                    G            C       G         Am
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her
.D                    G            C       G         Am
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her
.D                    G            C       G         Am         C  Em
 Call when you try to wake her up, call when you try to wake her       (*)

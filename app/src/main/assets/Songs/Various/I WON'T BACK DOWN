.       C#m   B    E          C#m   B    E
 Well I won't back down, no I won't back down
.        C#m      B         A
 You can stand me up at the gates of hell
.       C#m  B    E
 But I won't back down

.      C#m   B  E                C#m  B   E
 Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around
.         C#m       B          A
 And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
.        C#m B  E            C#m    B    E     A    E
 Gonna stand my ground and I  won't back down       

.A E B   E A                 E     B    E
 Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out  
.A E B      C#m   B  E            C#m   B    E
 hey I will stand my ground and I won't back down

 Well I know what's right I got just one life
 In a world that keep on pushin' me around
 But I'll stand my ground and I won't back down

 Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
 Hey I will stand my ground and I won't back down
 And I won't back down
 No I wont't back down</lyrics>

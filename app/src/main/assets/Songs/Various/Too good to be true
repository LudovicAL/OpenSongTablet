.EG     A    G        E   GAG
  Her imagination ran wild  
.EG                 A   G     E  GAG
  Could this really happen to me   
.EG                A    G        E    GAG
  She could barely hold back the tears

.       D              A
 It was too good to be true
.       D              A
 It was too good to be true
.       D              A   B
 It was too good to be true

 Everything that she'd waited for
 Everything that she'd dared to dream
 Suddenly was outside her door

;ref

.     D              B
 Ther was no talk of giving in
.    D                B
 And just as hope was wearin thin
.    D                B
 Her eyse were like a child again
 Too good to be true

 Morning on the outskirts of town
 Sitting in the traffic alone
 You don't know what it means to be free

.Em  Em7Em6  Emb6
             
.Em Em7              Em6
 My death waits like 
.Emb6   Em         Em7
 an old drouin (?) 
.   Em6        Emb6
 So confident  
.            Em
 I'll go his way

.Em7        Em6
 Whistle to him
.Emb6    D            Dsus4 D
 and the passing time   
.G              A
 My death waits like
.G       C
 a Bible truth
.       F             Am    Am/G
 at the funeral of my youth 
.      F
 oh we drank for that
.        G
 and the passing time

.G#m                 F#
 My death waits like 
.          G#m
 a witched night
.   F#                    G#m
 as surely as our love is bright
.          F#              B
 let's not think about the passing time

.Em                D                C
 But whatever lies behind the door  
.                         B
 there is nothing much to do
.Em             D             C    C/B
 Angel or Devil I don't care       
.             Am      Am/G             B   Bb   C#Gm
 For in front of that door there is you           
.Gm
 My death waits like a beggar blind
 who sees the world through an unled mind
.                         F
 throw him a dime for the passing time

.Bb             C#                 Bb
 My death waits there between your thighs
.          G#                    Cm
 Your cold fingers will close my eyes
.      G#
 Let's think of that
.        Bb
 And the passing time

.Bm              A
 My death waits  
.            Bm
 to allow my friend
.  A
 a few good  times
.          Bm
 before it ends
.         A
 so let's drink to that
.        F#
 and the passing time

.G                 F                    Eb
 but whatever lies behind the door      
.                         D      G
 there is nothing much to do     
.               F            Eb
 Angel or Devil I don't care 
 for in front of that door
.         D
 there is you

.Gm
 My death waits there among the leaves
 in magicians mysterious sleeves
.                         F
 rabbits and dogs and the passing time

.Bb             C#
 My death waits there
.          Bb
 among the flowers
.          G#              C#m
 where the blackest shadow cowers
.           G#             Bb
 Let's pick lilacs for the passing time

.Bm             A
 My death waits there
.            Bm
 in a double bed
.      A
 sails of oblivion
.      Bm
 at my head
.                A
 so pull up your seats against
.    F#
 the passing time

.Gm                F               Eb
 But whatever lies behind the door 
.                 D            Gm
 there is nothing much to do   
.               F
 Angel or Devil 
.              Eb
 I don't care  
 for in front of that door....... there is</lyrics>

.Dm
 We don't need no education
.Dm
 We don't need no thought control
.Dm
 No dark sarcasms in the classroom
.Dm                          G
 Teacher leave us kids alone 
.G                               Dm  C  Dm    Dm  G  F
 Hey teacher leave us kids alone                     
.F                       C                   Dm
 All in all you're just another brick in the wall
.F                       C                   Dm
 All in all you're just another brick in the wall

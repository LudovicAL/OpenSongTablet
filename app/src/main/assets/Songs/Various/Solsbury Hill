[Intro]  A E

.                         A   E      A
 Climbing up on Solsbury Hill        
.                        F#m  E      F#m
 I could see the city lights         
.                              F#m    E      F#m
 Wind was blowing, time stood still          
.                       A   E     A
 Eagle flew out of the night      
.                       A   E      A
 He was something to observe       
.                           F#m   E       F#m
 Came in close; I heard a voice           
.                             F#m   E      F#m
 Standing, stretching every nerve          
.                          Dmaj7
 I had to listen; had no choice
.   E        Dmaj7             Dmaj7
 I did not believe the information
.  E          Dmaj7         Bm9-7
 Just had to trust imagination
.    E          Dmaj7
 My heart going boom boom boom
.Dmaj7            D         A          Esus4   E        A
 Son, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home

 To keep in silence I resigned
 My friends would think I was a nut
 Turning water into wine
 Open doors would soon be shut
 So I went from day to day
 Though my life was in a rut
 Till I thought of what I'd say
 And which connection I should cut
 I was feeling part of the scenery
 I walked right out of the machinery
 My heart going boom boom boom
 Son, he said, grab your things I've come to take you home

 When illusion spin her net
 I'm never where I want to be
 And liberty she pirouette
 When I think that I am free
 Watched by empty silhouettes
 Who close their eyes but still can see
 No one taught them etiquette
 So I will show another me
 Today I don't need a replacement
 I'll show them what the smile on my face meant
 My heart going boom boom boom
 Hey, I said, you can keep my things they've come to take me home</lyrics>

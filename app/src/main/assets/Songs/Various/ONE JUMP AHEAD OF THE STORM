.C
  Lighting is flashing all around me,
.C
  Thunder is rolling up behind.
.C
  Big blue clouds (all full of rolling??)
.C
  (Put up tears and make me blind??)

.C
  I can't let her man recatch me.
.C
  I can't stop to cry no more.
.C
  I'm just running down the highway,
.C
  One jump ahead of the storm.

.C
  One day I looked on the horizon,
.C
  Saw her love just couldn't last.
.C
  Oh, my mind was torn to pieces.
.C
  I had to leave and get out fast.

.C
  And so I slipped out of her power.
.C
  I saw my chance and I was gone
.C
  Before the rain could start to falling.
.C
  One jump ahead of the storm.

;Chorus

.      C                      Bb      FC
 I was  one jump ahead of the  storm.  
.     C                      Bb      FC
 Just  one jump ahead of the  storm.  
.      C                      Bb      FC
 I was  one jump ahead of the  storm.  
.     C                      Bb      FC
 Just  one jump ahead of the  storm.  

.      C                      Bb      FC
 I was  one jump ahead of the  storm.  
.     C                      Bb      FC
 Just  one jump ahead of the  storm.  
.      C                      Bb      FC
 I was  one jump ahead of the  storm.  
.     C                      Bb      FC
 Just  one jump ahead of the  storm.</lyrics>

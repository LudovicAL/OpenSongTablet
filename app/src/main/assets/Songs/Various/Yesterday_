.F         Em7        A7                 Dm       Bm7
 Yesterday,    all my troubles seemed so far away 
.Bb     C7                      F             C   Dm        G   Bb    F
 Now it looks as though they're here to stay, oh  I believe in  yesterday
.F        Em7          A7             Dm         Bm7
 Suddenly,     I'm not half the man I used to be 
.Bb       C7             F           Dm    G        Bb    F
 Theres a shadow hanging over me, oh yesterday came suddenly

;Bridge
.Em7    A7     Dm     C     Bb    Dm     Gm       C       F
 Why    she    had    to    go    I dont know she wouldnt say
.Em7   A7   Dm  C     Bb    Dm    Gm       C     F
 I     said something wrong now I long for yesterday

.F         Em7         A7           Dm          Bm7
 Yesterday,   love was such an easy game to play
.Bb    C               F          C   Bb  G        C     F
 Now I need a place to hide away, oh  I believe in yesterday

;Repeat bridge

.F         Em7         A7           Dm          Bm7
 Yesterday,   love was such an easy game to play
.Bb    C               F          C   Bb  G        C     F
 Now I need a place to hide away, oh  I believe in yesterday
.F     G      Bb      F

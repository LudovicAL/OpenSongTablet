.G     C             Am
 I am sailing, I am sailing
.       F               C
 home again 'cross the sea
.      D              Am
 I am sailing stormy waters
.       Dm               C   G7
 to be near you, to be free  

.       C            Am
 I am flying, I am flying
.        F                C
 like a bird 'cross the sky
.       D              Am
 I am flying, passing high clouds,
.        Dm              C    G7
 to be with you, to be free   

.         C                Am
 Can you hear me, can you hear me
.             F                C
 through the dark night, far away
.      D7              Am
 I am dying, forever trying
.       Dm                C     G7    F        G7
 to be with you, who can say                   

.         C                Am
 Can you hear me, can you hear me
.             F                 C
 through the dark night, far away
.      D7             Am
 I am dying, forever trying
.       Dm                C     G7    C        G7
 to be with you, who can say                   

.        C               Am
 We are sailing, we are sailing
.       F               C
 home again 'cross the sea
.        D7             Am
 We are sailing stormy waters
.       Dm               C
 to be near you, to be free

.G7               Dm               C
 Oh, Lord, to be near you, to be free
.G7                C
 Oh, Lord, to be free</lyrics>

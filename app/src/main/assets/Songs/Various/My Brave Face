.A                   E6        E
 My brave, my brave, my brave face.

.E                   A
 I've been living in style
.E            A    E
 Unaccustomed as I am to the luxury life.
.A                     F#m7/C#   B      E
 I've been hitting the town      and it didn't hit back.

 I've been doing the rounds
 Unaccustomed as I am to the time on my hands.
 Now I don't have to tell anybody when I'm gonna get back.

.C#m            G#m            E7                       A
 Ever since you went away I've had this sentimental inclination
.         Am              E
 not to change a single thing.
.C#m                              G#m7                     A
 As I pull the sheets back on the bed I want to go bury my head
.        Am6
 In your pillow.

[C]
.E        B    E                        B        E
 Now that I'm alone again, I can't stop breaking down again,
.             B             C#m
 The simplest things set me off again
.            G#m7     F#m7/C#
 And take me to  that place
.A6                 A        E
 Where I can't find my brave face
.A6                 A        E
 Where I can't find my brave face
.A                   E6       E
 My brave, my brave, my brave face.

 I've been living a lie
 Unaccustomed as I am to the work of a housewife,
 I've been breaking up dirty dishes and throwing them away.

 Ever since you left I have been trying to
 Compose a "baby will you please come home" note meant for you.
 As I clear away another untouched TV dinner
 From the table I laid for two.

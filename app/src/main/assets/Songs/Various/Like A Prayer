 Life is a mystery
 Everyone must stand alone
 I hear you call my name
 And it feels like home

.F                C                        Bb
 When you call my name, it's like a little prayer
.               C?                      F
 I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
.                C                     Bb
 In the midnight hour, I can feel your power
.            C?
 Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there

.Bb          F      C            Dm
 I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
.Bb        F                   C      C
 I have no choice, I hear your voice, feels like flying ...

.Bb         F     C
 I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
.Bb         F      C              C
 Out of the sky, I close my eyes, heaven help me ...

;Chorus

.Bb     F      C
 Like a child, you whisper softly to me
.Bb           F          C             C
 You're in control, just like a child, now I'm dancing ...

.Bb          F      C
 It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
.Bb               F        C             C
 You're here with me, it's like a dream, let the choir sing ...

;Chorus

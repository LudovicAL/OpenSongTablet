;CHORUS
.D                         Bm
 Charlie don't surf and we think he should
.D                         Bm
 Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good
.D                          Em7
 Charlie don't surf for his hamburger Momma
.F#m7
 Charlie's gonna be a napalm star

 RIFF (you can strum with a x-x-0-4-0-2 ? rather than the riff)

 Everybody wants to rule the world
 Must be something we get from birth
 One truth is we never learn
 Satelites will make space burn

.D                  Bm
 We've been told to keep the strangers out
.D                  Bm
 We don't like them starting to hang around
.D                  Em7
 We don't like them over town
.F#m7
 Across the world we are going to mow them down

;CHORUS

 RIFF
 The reign of the super powers must be over
 So many armies can't free the earth
 Soon the rock will roll over
 Africa is choking on their Coca Cola

.D                            Bm
 It's a one a way street in a one horse town
.D               Bm
 One way people starting to bragg around
.D              Em7
 You can laugh, put them dowm
.F#m7
 These one way people gonna mow us down

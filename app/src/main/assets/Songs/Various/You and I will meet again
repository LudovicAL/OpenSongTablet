     x2

.B              A
 You and I will meet again
.E                  A       B
 When we're least expecting it
.               A
 Oneday in some fare off place
.E          A          B
 I will recognize your face
.Bm7              A      E
 I Won't say good-bye my friend
.    A       E      A    E
 For you and I will meet again

.BBm7 B Bm7
    

 I heard you singing to no one
 I saw you dancing all alone
 Oneday you belonged to me
 Next day I just wouldn't know
 Oneday all the rules will bent
 and you and I will meet again

.           A  E
 I've got a feeling
.           A  E       B
 I've got a feeling so strong
.      A   E   A   E          B
 Maybe someday our roads will cross

     x7

 A red winged hawk is circling
 The blacktop stretches out for days
 How could I get so close to you
 and still feel so far away
 I hear a voice come on the wind
 Sayin' you and I will meet again
 I don't know how. I don't know when
 But you and I will meet again

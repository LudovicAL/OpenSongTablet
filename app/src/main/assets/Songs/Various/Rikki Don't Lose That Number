;Intro
.E

.D              A               E
 We hear you're leaving, that's OK
.D                    A                    E  C#       B
 I thought our little wild time had just begun         
.D                   A                    E
 I guess you kind of scared yourself, you turn and run
.F#m7              A
 But if you have a change of heart

;Chorus
.E                                             G
 Rikki don't lose that number, you don't wanna call nobody else
.A                G             D
 Send it off in a letter to yourself
.C                                     Em
 Rikki don't lose that number it's the only one you own
.C                 D  A                           E
 You might use it if you feel better when you get home

.D        A                               E
 I have a friend in town, he's heard your name
.D             A
 We can go out driving on slow hand row
.E  C# B  D               A                  E
 We could stay inside and play games I don't know
.F#m7
 And you could have a change of heart

;Chorus

.Amaj7                    G#m7
 You tell yourself you're not my kind
.Amaj7              C#m7
 But you don't even know your mine
.F#m7
 And you could have a change of heart

;Chorus

 Rikki don't lose that number, Rikki don't lose that number</lyrics>

;Cover by Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds on "Kicking Against the Pricks", 1986

;verse 1:

.              A
 Just running scared
.              Bm
 Each place we go
.     C#m
 So afraid
.E7           E9sus4 E7
 That he might show

;verse 2:
.               A
 Yeah, running scared
;drums enter
.             Bm
 What would I do
.           C#m
 If he came back
.E7          A
 And wanted you

;verse 3:
A
 Just running scared
;electrics enter
.        Bm
 Feeling low
.         C#m
 Running scared
;bass enters
.              E7
 You loved him so

;verse 4:
.              A
 Just running scared
;backing vocals enter
.           Bm
 Afraid to lose
.           C#m
 If he came back
.E7                    A   A7
 Which one would you choose

;coda:
.D            D6
 Then all at once
;guitars stay on D; strings follow D6 and Dmaj7
.Dmaj7            D   Dmaj7 D6
 He was standing there
.    D          D6
 So sure of himself
.    Dmaj7        D Dmaj7 D6
 His head in the air
.D              D6
 My heart was breaking
.Dmaj7              D
 Which one would it be
.D             D6        D     E7       A
 You turned around and walked away with me

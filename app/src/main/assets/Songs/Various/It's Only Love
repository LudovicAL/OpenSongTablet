;Intro - guitar

.C#m    B    Abm    A    E
                         

 When the feelin' is ended
 There ain't no use pretendin'
 Don't ya worry - it's only love

 When your world has been shattered
 Ain't nothin' else matters
 It ain't over - it's only love
 And that's all - ya

;Guitar

 When your heart has been broken
 Hard words have been spoken
 It ain't easy - but it's only love

 And if your life ain't worth livin'
 And you're ready to give in
 Just remember - that it's only love

.B                        C#m
 You can live without the aggravation
.A
 Ya gotta wanna win - ya gotta wanna win
.B                        C#m
 You keep lookin' back in desperation
.A
 Over and over and over again

;Guitar

 When your world is shattered
 Ain't nothin' else matters
 It ain't over - it's only love

 If your life ain't worth livin'
 And you're ready to give in
 Just remember - that it's only love
 Ya - that's all

;Guitar

 Ya it ain't easy baby
 But it's only love - and that's all</lyrics>

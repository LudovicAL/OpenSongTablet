;3/4

.G                                 F#m
  pushing thru' the market square  
.Em  C
  so many mother sighing
.A
  News had just come over
.       C                         GAm
 We had five years left ti cry in  

 News guy wept and told us
 earth eas really dying
 Cried so much, his face was wet
 Then i knew he was not lying.

.G Am    G
 I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
.  Bm  Em
 I saw boys, toys, electric irons and T.V's
.   A
 My brain hurt like a ware house, it had no room to spare
.         C
 I had to cram so many things to store ev'ry thing in there
.                Am
 And all the fat skinny people
.C                       Am
  And all the tall short people
.C              G  Am G
  And all the nobody  people
.C                G  Am D7
  And all the somebody  people
.                                 Am     C  G  Am
 I never thought i'd need so many people       

 A girl my age went off her head
 Hit some tiny children
 If the black had not puled her off
 I think she would have killed them

 A soldier with a broken arm
 Fixed his state to the wheels of a Cadilac
 A cop Knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
 And a queer threw up at at the sight of that

.G                                           F#m
  I think i saw you in an ice cream parlour  
.Em
  Drinking milkshakes cold and long
.A
  smiling and waving and looking so fine
.C
  Don't think you knew you were in this song

.    G  Am  G
 And it was cold, and it rained, so i felt like an actor
.F#m   Em
 And i thoought of Ma, and i wanted to get back there
.     A
 Your face, Your race, the way that you talk
.  C                                                   G  Am
 I kiss you, you're beautifull, I want you to walk. we got

;Repeat once
.G                             Bm
 five years stuck on my eyes   
.Em
 five years what a surprise we got
.A
 five years my brain hurts a lot
.C
 five years that's all we got we've got</lyrics>

;Keyboard plays a C#m on this sentence
 "Sometimes I feel like I don't know, sometimes I feel like checking out
 I wanna get it wrong, can't always be strong, and love it won't be long"

.       EG#m A
[Intro]    (this is structure (1))

 (1)     Oh sugar, don't you cry,
 oh child wipe the tears from your eyes
 You know I need you to be strong,
 and the day's as dark as the night is long

.         C#m                        B
 (2)     Feel like trash, you make me feel clean
. A
 I'm in the black, can't see or be seen
. C#m         B             A
 Baby, baby, baby, light my way
. C#m         B             A
 Baby, baby, baby, light my way

 (1)     You bury your treasure where it can't be found
 But your love's like a secret that's been passed around
 There is a silence that comes to a house where no one can sleep

 (2)     I guess it's the price of love, I know it's not cheap
 Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way
 Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way

.        E  B  C#m   A
 (3)     Ooooh, ultraviolet...  (twice)
.C#m              B                      E    A
 Baby, baby, baby, light my way               

 (1)     I remember when we could sleep on stones
 But now we lie together in whispers and moans
 When I was all messed up, and I heard opera in my head

 (2)     Your love was a lightbulb hanging over my bed
 Baby, baby, baby, light my way
 Baby, baby, baby, light my way

 (3)     Ooooh, ultraviolet...

.        G#m               A    E                B
 (4)     Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,     
.C#m           B            E
 Baby, baby, baby, light my way</lyrics>

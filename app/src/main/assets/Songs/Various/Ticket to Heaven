[Intro]           (twice)

.D                                                         A
 I can see what you're looking to find in the smile on my face
.G                A               G          D
 In my peace of mind       In my state of grace
.D                                            A
 I send what I can to the man from the ministry
.G                        A                    D
 he's a part of heaven's plan and he talks to me

.D                                                   A
 Now I send what I can to the man with the diamond ring
.G                        A     G                 D
 he's a part of heaven's plan    and he sure can sing
.D                                                         A
 now it's all I can afford but the lord has sent me eternity
.G                          A                     D
 it's to save the little children in a poor country

.D                                           A
 I got my ticket to heaven and everlasting life
.G                     A     G         D
 I got a ride all the way     to paradise
.D                                           A
 I got my ticket to heaven and everlasting life
.G          A           D
 all the  way to paradise

.D
 Now there's nothing left for luxuries nothing left to pay my
.          A
 heating bills
.G                           A    G           D
 but the good lord will provide    I know he will
.D                                                  A
 so send what you can to the man with the diamond ring
.G                              A                D
 they're tuning in across the land to hear him sing
.D                                           A
 I got my ticket to heaven and everlasting life
.G                   A    G         D
 got a ride all the way    to paradise
.D                                           A
 I got my ticket to heaven and everlasting life
.G         A           DBm
 All the way to paradise
.G         A           DBm
 All the way to paradise

. C                                     F                   C
 I'm gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local DJ.
.       F                                         C
 It's a rockin' little record I want my jockey to play.
.     G                 F                   C
 Roll Over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today.

 You know, my temperature's risin' and the jukebox blows a fuse.
 My heart's beatin' rhythm and my soul keeps on singin' the blues.
 Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tschaikowsky the news.

 I got the rockin' pneumonia, I need a shot of rhythm and blues.
 I caught the rollin' off a writer, sittin' down by the rhythm review.
 Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two.

[C
;chorus
.C
 Well, if you feel you like it
.C
 go get your lover, then reel and rock it.
.C                F
 Roll it over and move on up just
.F                    C
 a trifle further and reel and rock it,
.C
 roll it over,
.G                   F                 C
 Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two.
[

 Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you a warnin'
 don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
 Hey diddle diddle, I am playin' my fiddle,
 ain't got nothin' to lose.
 Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tschaikowsky the news.

 You know she wiggles like a glow worm, dance like a spinnin' top.
 She got a crazy partner, oughta see 'em reel and rock.
 Long as she got a dime the music will never stop.

.C
 Roll Over Beethoven,
.C
 Roll Over Beethoven,
.C              F
 Roll Over Beethoven,
.F              C
 Roll Over Beethoven,
.     G                  F                    C
 Roll Over Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues.</lyrics>

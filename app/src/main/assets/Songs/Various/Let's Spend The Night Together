.Ab                           Gm
 Don't you worry 'bout what's on your mind
.        Eb7
 (oh my, da da da da da da da da)
.Ab                    Gm
 I'm in no hurry I can take my time
.        Eb7
 (oh my, da da da da da da da da)
.Db                                      Ab
 I'm going red and my tongue's getting tied
.Db
 I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
.Cm
 (I'm high, but I try, try, try...oh my)
.Eb7
 Let's spend the night together
 Now I need you more than ever
.                               Ab     Gm Eb7
 Let's spend the night together now     

 I feel so strong that I can't disguise
 (oh my, let's spend the night together)
 But I just can't apologise
 (oh no, let's spend the night together)
 Don't hang me up and don't let me down
 We could have fun just grooving around
 (around and around oh my, my)
 Let's spend the night together
 Now I need you more than ever
.Db
 Let's spend the night together
.Ab
 Now I need you more than ever
.Db
 Let's spend the night together

.Ab
 You know I'm smiling, baby
.Db
 You need some guiding, baby
.Ab
 I'm just deciding, baby
.    Eb
 Now I need you more than ever
.Eb7
 Let's spend the night together
.                                      AbGmEb7
 Let's spend the night together now        

 This doesn't happen to me every day
 (oh my, let's spend the night together)
 No excuses offered anyway
 (oh my, let's spend the night together)
 I'll satisfy your every need
 And now I know you will satis

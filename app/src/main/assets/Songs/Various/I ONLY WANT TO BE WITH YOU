.  D                                   Bm
 I don't know what it is that makes me love you so.
.  D                       Bm
 I only know I never wanna let you go
.     G           A7         Em        A7
 'cos you started something, can't you see.
.D                              Bm
 Ever since we met you've had a hold on me.
.   G             A7      Em           A7       D
 It happens to be true, I only want to  be with you.

 It doesn't matter where you go or what you do.
 I wanna spend each moment of the day with you.
 Look what has happened with just one kiss.
 I never knew that I could be in love like this.
 It's crazy but it's true5 I only want to be with you.

.B
 You stopped and smiled at me,
.D               G       D
 asked me if I'd care to dance.
.A
 I fell into your open arms,
.E7                A
  I didn't stand a chance.
.     A7
 Now,  listen, honey,

 I just wanna be beside you everywhere.
 As long as we're together, honey, I don't care
 'cos you started something, can't you see.
 Ever since we met you've had a hold on me.
 No matter what you do, I only want to be with you.

 You stopped and smiled at me,
 asked me if I'd care to dance.
 I feel into your open arms,
 I didn't stand a chance.

 Now, listen, honey, I just wanna be beside you everywhere.
 As long as we're together, honey, I don't care
 'cos you started something, can't you see.
 Ever since we met you've had a hold on me.
 No matter what you do, I only want to be with you.
 No matter, no matter what you do, I only want to be with you.
 No matter, no matter what you do, I only want to be with you.</lyrics>

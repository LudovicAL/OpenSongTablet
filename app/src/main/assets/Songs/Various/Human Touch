;G* = G w/suspended A

.A             G*          D
 You and me we were the pretenders
.A             G*    D
 We let it all slip away
.A                   G*       D
 In the end what you don't surrender
.G                           A
 Well the world just strips away
.A                              G*      D
 Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers
.A                   G*       D
 Ain't gonna find no miracles here
.A                         G*         D
 Well you can wait on your blesses my darling
.G                          A
 I got a deal for you right here
.G                   D
 I ain't looking for praise or pity
.G                     D               G
 I ain't coming 'round searching for a crutch
.G           D
 I just want someone to talk to
.G                          A
 And a little of that Human Touch
.G                           A
 Just a little of that Human Touch

.A                     G*         D
 Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town
.A                   G*       D
 Ain't no bread from Heavenly skies
.A                    G*        D
 Ain't nobody drawing wine from this blood
.G                      A
 It's just you and me tonight
.G             D
 Tell me, in a world without pity
.G                     D           G
 Do you think what I'm askin's too much
.G                     D
 I just want something to hold on to
.G                          A
 And a little of that Human Touch
.G                           A
 Just a little of that Human Touch

.             G          D               A
 Oh girl that feeling of safety that you prize
.        Em
 Well it comes at a hard hard price
.          G            D            A
 You can't shut off the risk and the pain
.        Em
 Without losing the love that remains
.                         G
 We're all riders on this train

.A                     G*         D
 So you've been broken and you've been hurt
.A           G*       D
 Show me somebody who ain't
.A                    G*       D
 Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain
.G                                         A
 But, hell, a little touch up and a little paint...
.G                        D
 You might need something to hold on to
.G                    D                     G
 When all the answers, they don't amount to much
.G             D
 Somebody that you could just to talk to
.G                          A
 And a little of that Human Touch
.G          D
 Baby, in a world without pity
.G                     D             G
 Do you think what I'm askin's too much
.G              D
 I just want to feel you in my arms
.G                            A
 Share a little of that Human Touch
.G                           A
 Feel a little of that Human Touch
.G                              A
 Give me a little of that Human Touch</lyrics>

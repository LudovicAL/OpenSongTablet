.   Am                       G             Am
 As soon as you're born they make you feel small
.   Am                   G           Am
 By giving you no time instead of it all
.         Am                      G          Am
 'til the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
.  Am                    G            Am
 A working class hero is something to be
.  Am            G       D            Am
 A working class hero is something to be

 They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
 They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
 'til youre so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
 A working class hero is something to be
 A working class hero is something to be

 When they've tortured and scared you for 20 odd years
 Then they expect you to pick a career
 When you cant really function you're so full of fear
 A working class hero is something to be
 A working class hero is something to be

 Keep you doped with religion and sex and tv
 and you think you're so clever and classless and free
 But youre still fucking peasants as far as I can see
 A working class hero is something to be
 A working class hero is something to be

 There's room at the top they're telling you still
 but first you must learn to smile as you kill
 If you want to be like the folks on the hill
 A working class hero is something to be
 A working class hero is something to be

.       Am                     G           Am
 If you want to be a hero well just follow me
.       Am           G    D           Am
 If you want to be a hero just follow me</lyrics>

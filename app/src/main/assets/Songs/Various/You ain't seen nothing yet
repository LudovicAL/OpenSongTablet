.A        G       D
                  

.A                 G      D
 I met a devil woman      
.A                    G      D
 She took my heart away      
.A                            G      D
 She said I had it coming to me      
.A                      G      D
 But I wanted it that way      
.D                                F      G
 I think that any love is good love      
.A                C#m    F#
 So I took what I could get ooh..ooh
.B                                         E
 She looked at me with big brown eyes and said...

.A                         E     D
 You ain't seen nothin' yet      
.A                                      E      D
 B-B-Baby you just ain't seen nothin' yet      
.A                                        E      D
 Here's something you're never gonna forget      
.A                                        E      D     C#m      B      A
 B-B-Baby you just ain't seen n-n-nothin' yet (you ain't been around)

.A                        G      D
 And now I'm feelin' better      
.A                         G      D
 'Cause I found out for sure      
.A                       G      D
 She took me to her doctor      
.A                      G      D
 And he told me of a cure      
.D                                F      G
 He said that any love is good love      
.A                       C#m      F#
 So I took what I could get       
.B
 Yes I took what I could get
.B                                              E
 And then she looked at me with big brown eyes..said

.                     G        D                          G    D
 When the day is long, and the night, the night is yours alone.
.                            G             D            G  Em

 Don't let yourself go,  cause everybody cries,  and everybody hurts.

.  D       G                          D     G
 Sometimes,   sometimes everything is wrong.
.                       D                              G
 Now it's time to sing along                      hold on,
 when your day is night alone

.     D                            G  D
 hold on.                     hold on.
 when you feel like let him go.

.                         G            D            G  Em
 You think you've had too much of this life to hang on.

 Don't throw your hand, ho-old on.    Don't throw your hand.
.                         G     C                Am   D
 If you feel like you're alone. no, no, no, not alone.

.                  G            D                          G    D
 If you're on your own. Of this life, the days and nights alone.
.                              G            D             G  Em
 When you think you've had too much of this life, to hang on.
.              A          Em                  A     Em
 For everybody hurts. For sometimes everybody cries.
.          A
 Everybody hurts.
.  D      G           D
 Sometimes  everybody hurts.
.  G             D        G        D        G        D        G
 Sometimes, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on (fade out)</lyrics>

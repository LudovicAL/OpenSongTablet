 A / B / C#m
 A / B / G#m

.A       B          C#m
   Lady writer on the TV
.A       B            C#m
   Talk about the virgin mary
.A          B      C#m
   Reminded me of you
.A             B      G#m
   Expectation left a come on too

 Lady writer on the TV
 She had another quality
 The way you used to look
 And I know you never read a book

.A                                       C#m
   Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
.A                 C#m        G#m
   And I recall my fall from grace
.F#m       F#m7          C#m
   Another time another place

 Lady writer on the TV
 She had all her brains and the beauty
 The pictures does not fit
 You'd talk to me when you felt like this

 Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
 And I recall my fall from grace
 Another time another place
.E
    Your rich old man,
.                    B
 You know he'd a call her a dead wringer
.G#m
     You got the same command
.F#m
     Plus your mother was a mess in life

 Solo: A / B /C#m etc

 Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
 And I recall my fall from grace
 Another time another place

 Lady writer on the TV
 She knew all about history
 You couldn't hardly write your name
 I think I want it just the same

 Lady writer on the TV
 Talking about the virgin mary
 You know I'm talking about you and me

;Fleetwood Mac
;Each chord is half a measure

[Intro]  E   A/E   E   A/E   E   A/E   E   A/E

.E        D           A                  A
   If you wake up and don't want to smile
.E       D            A           A
   If it takes just a little while
.E           D        A              A
   Open your eyes and look at the day
.B            B           B          B
   You'll see things in a different way

.E     D/E  A                A
 Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
.E     D/E   A             A
 Don't stop; it'll soon be here
.E       D/E  A               A
  It'll be    better than before
.B             B     B          B
 Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

 Why not think about times to come
 And not about the things that you've done
 If your life was bad to you
 Just think what tomorrow will do

 All I want is to see you smile
 If it takes just a little while
 I know you don't believe that it's true
 I never meant any harm to you

.E  D/E  A   A              E   D/E A A
 Oooooooooh, don't you look back....</lyrics>

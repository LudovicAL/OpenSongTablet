.     A                   D
 They say we're young and we don't know,
.A              D    G  E
 won't find out till we grow.
.E7    A
  Well I don't know if that's all true
.       A               D
 'cause you got me, and baby
.G     E   E7    A     D
 I got you       babe. 
.      A         D
 I got you babe. 
.      A         D
 I got you babe. 

 They say our love won't pay the rent,
 before it's earned, our money's always spent
 I guess that's so, we don't have a pot,
 but at least I'm sure of all the things I got, babe
 I got you babe.
 I got you babe.
 I got you babe.

.  Bm                 E
 I got flowers in the spring.
.      Bm             E
 I got you to wear my ring.
.             A             D
 And when I'm sad, you're a clown,
.             D                     E
 and if I get scared, you're always around.
.F
 And

.     Bb                   Eb
 then they say your hair's too long,
.    Bb                 Eb    Ab       F     F7
 but I don't care, with you I can't go wrong.
.     Bb              Eb            Bb
 Then put your little hand in mine, there ain't no hill or
.Eb       Ab       F     F7 Bb  Eb
 mountain we can't climb, babe. 
.      Bb        Eb
 I got you babe. 
.      Bb        Eb Bb Eb
 I got you babe.   

.Bb            Eb
  I got you to hold my hand.
.Bb           F
 I got you to understand.
.Bb           Eb
 I got you to walk with me.
.Bb           F
 I got you to talk with me.
.Bb           Eb
 I got you to kiss goodnight.
.Bb           F
 I got you to hold me tight.
.Bb           Eb
 I got you, I won't let go.
.Bb            F
 I got you who loves me so.
.Bb Eb Bb F
    

.  Eb      Bb
 I got you babe.</lyrics>

;TUNING: E B E G# B E

.A  Asus A Asus A  B Bsus B Bsus B  E Esus E Esus E
                                                  
.       A                             E     Esus  E  Esus  E
 They paved paradise and put up a parking lot              
.         A              B                     E
 With a pink hotel, a boutique and a swingin' hot spot

;CHORUS:
. E
 Don't it always seem to go
.          A                                      N.C.
 That you don't know what you've got till it's gone
.       A                 B                E
 They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
.  Esus E  Esus        E      Esus E  Esus        E
 (Choo     bop bop bop bop, choo     bop bop bop bop)

 They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
 And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em

;CHORUS

 Hey farmer farmer, put away that D.D.T. now
 Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees
 please

;CHORUS

 Late last night I heard the screen door slam
 And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

;CHORUS TWICE (with only one chooo bop... at each end)

 They paved paradise, put up a parking lot (choo bop bop bop bop)
 They paved paradise, put up a parking lot

;NOTE: I don't actually know if these chords are "sus" chords, but I had
;to call them something!  Also, on the first two lines of the chorus and
;frequently on the verse, it is better to somewhat muffle the chords so
;that the rhythm can be heard but the actual notes barely heard.  Also,
;the song can be played in regular tuning with the same chords, but I
;think it sounds much better this way (and this is what J.M. actually does).
;Also, please post if you know any J.M. songs in their actual
;tuning.  I hear that of all her guitar songs, she only did around
;two of them in standard tuning!

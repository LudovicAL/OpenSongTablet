;Use a C  Em7  Fmaj7 chord progression except where shown

 You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
 but I look around me and I see it isn't so
 Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
.           Em7
 and what's wrong with that
.    Fmaj7               G
 I'd like to know 'cause here I go again
 I love you I love you I love you I love you

 I can't explain the feeling's plain to me say can't you see
 Ah she gave me more she gave it all to me now can't you see
.       Em7
 What's wrong with that
.  Fmaj7               G
 I need to know 'cause here I go again
 I love you I love you

.Em7                    Am
 Love doesn't come in a minute
.Dm7                          C
 Sometimes it doesn't come at all
.Em7                       Am
 I only know that when I'm in it
.Dm7         C
 It isn't silly
.Dm7         C
 It isn't silly
.Dm7                    Dm7/G
 Love isn't silly at all

 How can I tell you about my loved one?
 How can I tell you about my loved one?
 How can I tell you about my loved one?
 I love you I love you I love you I love you

 I can't explain the feeling's plain to me say can't you see
 Ah she gave me more she gave it all to me now can't you see

 You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
 but I look around me and I see it isn't so
 Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
 and whats wrong with that?</lyrics>

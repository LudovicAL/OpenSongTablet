[Intro]    x4

.A                                C#
 Stoop's so fine on a summer's eve
.                                         Bm
 when you sit outside for a short reprieve
.                                    D
 Talk to folks as they come and leave
.                           A D A D
 Jono, Jay, and Crazy Steve.      

.A                                   C#
 Night is down but it's bright as day
.                                           Bm
 You haven't been around since you went away
.                                    D
 Feels so good so that's what you say
.                                 A D A D
 Folks say hi, but you say, "Hey."      

.                D
 Well, that old mad dog, he's barking for the blues bone
.A
 Orpheus got a black book and a telephone
.E/G#
 Plays that lyre 'cause he doesn't want to be alone;
.D                Dm
 One look back....

 Buy a beer, find a place to stand
 Have a couple laughs and hear the band
 Smoke a couple of your favorite brand
 Wake up with a stamp on the back of your hand.

.F#m                            D           C#           Bm
 Don't blame me, it's all been Laraby's gang, now, now.
.F#m                                D                    C#        Bm
 Don't blame me for the song that the Nightingale sang, now, now.
.F#m
 Don't blame me 'bout the vanishing waif,
.                                    D      C#     Bm
 Don't blame me if your safe ain't safe, now, now.

.             A D A D A D A D
 Guitar Solo:               

 Sun comes up, you're still awake.
 There's the sky, still as a lake.
 Not even that can drown the ache,
 Looks so high, it must be fake.

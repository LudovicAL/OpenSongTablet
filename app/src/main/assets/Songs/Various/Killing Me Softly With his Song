.Dm7        G                 C           F
 I heard he sang a good song,  I heard he had a style
.Dm7      G                   Am
 And so I came to see him, to listen for a while
.Dm7          G                   C           E7
 And there he was this young boy,  a stranger to my eyes

[C
.Am                         F        G                        C
 Strumming my pain with his fingers, Singing my life with his words
.Am                     D/F#                 G               F
 Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song
.           C                   F                   Bb            A
 Telling my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song
[

.Dm7        G                   C           F
 I felt all flushed with fever,  embarassed by the crowd
.Dm7       G                    Am
 I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
.Dm7           G                C            E7
 I prayed that he would finish,  but he just kept right on

.Dm7        G              C          F
 He sang as if he knew me,  in all my dark despair
.Dm7         G                          Am
 And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
.Dm7        G                    C        E7
 But he was there this stranger,  singing clear and strong

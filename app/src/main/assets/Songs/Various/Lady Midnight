.  G                G7        F            C
 I came by my-self to a very crowded place;
.G                      G7                      F    C
 I was looking for someone who had lines in her face.
.                          C7                F     F
 I found her there   but she was past all con-cern;
.   C               F       Em Dm                   Dm
 I asked her to hold me,     said, "Lady, un-fold me,"
.    Em7 C                         F
 but she scorned me and she told me
.         G     G7                     C
 I was dead  and I could never re-turn.

 Well, I argued all night like so many have before,
 saying, "Whatever you give me, I seem to need so much more."
 Then she pointed at me where I kneeled on her floor,
 she said, "Don't try to use me or slyly refuse me,
 just win me or lose me,
 it is this that the darkness is for."

 I cried, "Oh, Lady Midnight, I fear that you grow old,
 the stars eat your body and the wind makes you cold."
 "If we cry now," she said, "it will just be ignored."
 So I walked through the morning, sweet early morning,
 I could hear my lady calling,

. F          G                    G7    C
 "You've won me, you've won me, my lord,
.           G                    G7    C
 you've won me, you've won me, my lord,
.C               G                    G7     C
  yes, you've won me, you've won me, my lord,
.C              G                    G7     C
  ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord,
.C              G                    G7      C
  ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord."</lyrics>

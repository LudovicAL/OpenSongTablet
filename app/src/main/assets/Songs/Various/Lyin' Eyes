.G               Gmaj7            C        Am
 City girls just seem to find out early    How to open
.                       D
 doors with just a smile__
.  G                 Gmaj7                C
 A rich old man, and she wont' have to worry;  She'll
.Am                  C                 G
 dress up all in lace__ and go in style__
.G               Gmaj7                  C            Am
 Late at night a big old house gets lonely   I guess every
.                            D
 form of refuge has its price__.
.       G                   Gmaj7               C
 And it breaks her heart to think her love is only Given
.Am               C                G
 to a man with hands as cold as ice__ .
.CD       G                  Gmaj7             C
   So she tells him she must go out for the evening  to
.Am                                      D
 comfort an old friend who's feelin' down__
.    G                      Gmaj7        C
 But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin' she is
.Am             C                    G
 headed for the cheatin' side of town__

[C]
.          G         C/G             G
 You can't hide_____  your lyin' eyes__, and your
.Em      Bm            Am
 smile___ is a thin disguise
.D             G      G9            C     A      Am
  I thought by now____ you'd realize______ There ain't
.              D                  G
 no way to hide___ your lyin' eyes____
[]

.G                    Gmaj7             C          Am
 On the other side of town a boy is waiting   with fiery
.                                  D
 eyes and dreams no one could steal__.
.    G                     Gmaj7          C
 She drives on through the night anticipating 'cause he
.Am                    C                  G
 makes her feel the way__ she used to feel__ .
.CD    G             Gmaj7                C
   She rushes to his arms,they fall together   she
.Am                                D
 whispers that it'sonly for a while__
.    G                          Gmaj7           C
 She swears that soon she'll be  comin'back for ever  she
.Am             C                      G
 pulls away and leaves him with a smile__

[C]
.          G         C/G             G
 You can't hide_____  your lyin' eyes__, and your
.Em      Bm            Am
 smile___ is a thin disguise
.D             G      G9            C     A      Am
  I thought by now____ you'd realize______ There ain't
.              D                  G
 no way to hide___ your lyin' eyes____

.G                Gmaj7           C                 Am
 She gets up and  pours herself a strong one,   and stares
.                              D
 out at the stars up in the sky__
.   G                 Gmaj7           C             Am
 An other night, it's gonna be a long one;      she draws
.                   C                 G
 the shade and hangs__ her head to cry__
.G                    Gmaj7            C         Am
 She wonders how  it  ever got this crazy    she thinks
.                             D
 about a boy she knew in shool__.
.    G                Gmaj7              C         Am
 Did she get tired or did she just get lazy  She's so far
.              C                  G
 gone she feels__ just like a fool__ .
.CDG              Gmaj7              C
   My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things You
.Am                             D
 set it up so well, so carefully___
.         G                 Gmaj7        C
 Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things You're
.Am                 C                  G
 still the same old girl you used to be___</lyrics>

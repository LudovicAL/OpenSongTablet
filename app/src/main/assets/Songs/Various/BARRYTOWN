.A              Bm7            D         D/E        A
 I'm not one to look behind, I know that times must change
.    A             Bm7            D         D/E    A
 But over there in Barrytown they do things pretty strange

.    F#m7                 C#m
 And though you're not my enemy
.  D           C#m       Bm7     E
 I like things like they used to be
.    A                      Bm7
 And though you'd like some company
.    D        C#m  Bm7
 I'm standing by myself
.   D         C#m     Bm7
 Go play with someone else

.      Bm7/F# A/E      D     C#m      Bm7
 I can see by what you carry that you come from
.E    A
 Barrytown

 Don't believe I'm taken in by stories I have heard
 I just read the daily news and swear by every word

 And don't think that I'm out of line
 For speaking out for what is mine
 I'd like to see you do just fine
 But look at what you wear
 And the way you cut your hair

 I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown

;Bridge:
.F                Am7                        Bbmaj7
         In the beginning we recall that the world was hurled
.F                 Am7                    Bbmaj7
         Barrytown people got to be from another world
.A

 Lift me or I'll be just like the others you will meet
 They won't act as kindly if they see you on the street

 And don't you scream or make a shout
 There's nothing you can do about
 It was there when you came out
 It's a special lack of grace
 I can see it in your face

 I can see by what you carry that you come from Barrytown</lyrics>

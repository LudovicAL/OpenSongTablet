.A
 Circle sky,
 telling lies.
 Here I stand
 happy man,
.       G                F       E      A
 and it looks like we've made it once again.
.        G                F       E      A
 Yes, it looks like we've made it once again.

 Colors, sound
 all around.
 Wing-tip smile,
 sees for miles.
.       G                F       E      A
 and it looks like we've made it once again.
.        G                F       E      A
 Yes, it looks like we've made it once again.

.Bm
 It's a very extraordinary scene,
 to those who don't understand,
.    Dm
 but what you have seen you must believe,
.       E
 if you can,
 if you can.
.A
 Hamilton
 smiling down.
 Telling more,
 than before,
.       G                F       E      A
 and it looks like we've made it once again.
.        G                F       E      A
 Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end!

;Intro:    F#m  C#m/F#  |  F#m6  Bm6  |  F#m  C#7sus  |  F#m

;Verse 1:
.F#m   F#m7        F#m6        Bm6
 Ev'ry time that I look in the mirror
.F#m         F#m7        F#m6         Bm6
   All these lines on my face gettin' clearer
.F#m F#m7      F#m6   Bm6
   The past is gone   
.F#m     F#m7    F#m6    Bm6
 It went by like dusk to dawn

;Bridge:
.D#m7           C#sus4 C#    D#m7               Bm6
 Isn't that the way       ev'rybody's got their dues in life to pay?

.C#F#m D#7 C#7
         

;Chorus 1:
.F#5    E5           D5                      E5
 I know nobody knows where it comes and where it goes
.F#5            E5            D5                 E5
 I know it's ev'ryvody's sin; you got to lose to know how to win

.F#m C#m F#m6 Bm6 F#m F#m9 F#m
               

;Verse 2:
 Half my life's in books' written pages
 Lived and learned from fools and from sages
 You know it's true
 All these things come back to you.

;Chorus 2:
 Sing with me,sing for the years.
 Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears.
 Sing with me if it's just for today,
 Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

.B5        C#5       D5        E5                          F#5
 Dream on, dream on, dream on, dream yourself a dream come true.
.B5        C#5       D5            E5                           F#5
 Dream on, dream on, dream on, and dream until your dream comes true.
.B5        C#m       D5        E5
 Dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on,
.F#5       G#5       A5        B5
 Dream on, dream on, dream on, ah
.C#5
 Aaah.____________________________________________

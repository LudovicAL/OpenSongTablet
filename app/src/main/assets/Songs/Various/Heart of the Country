.       Bb           Dm
 I look high, I look low,
.            Gm
 I'm lookin' everywhere I go,
.Bb              D7
 Lookin' for a home
.                    Gm
 In the heart of the country.

.    A     Bb            Dm
 l'm gonna go, l'm gonna go,
.          Gm
 I'm gonna tell everyone I know
.Bb                  D
 Lookin ' for a home 
.                    Gm
 In the heart of the country.

.G7
 Heart of the country
.          C7
 Where the holy people grow,
.G7
 Heart of the country,
.          C7
 Smell the grass in the meadow.

 Wo wo wo.

.A    Bb            Dm
 Want horse, I want sheep,
.          Gm
 I want to get me a good night's sleep,

 Livin ' in a home 
.                    Gm
 In the heart of the country.

 l'm gonna go, I'm gonna go,

 l'm gonna tell everyone I know

 Livin' in a home  
.                    Gm
 In the heart of the country.

 Heart of the country
.          C7
 Where the holy people grow,

.          C7
 Smell the grass in the meadow.

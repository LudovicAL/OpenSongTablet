.F                 C7             F               C
 Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt
.F               C7            Dm              G
 And for all the little pigies life is getting worse
.Dm7           G7      C7  Bb Cdim C
 Always having dirt to play around in

.F                 C7             F                       C
 Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts
.F                 C7             Dm              G
 You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
.Dm7               G7        C7  Bb Cdim C
 Always have clean shirts to play around in

;Bridge
.Gm                  A7
 In their styes with all their backing
.Bb                   C
 They don't care what goes on around
.Gm                    A7
 In their eyes there's something lacking
.Bb                 C
 what they need's a damn good whacking

.F                 C7               F            C
 Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
.F                C7             Dm              G
 You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
.Dm7                 G7         C7  Bb Cdim C
 Clutching forks and knives to eat their baclutching forks and on</lyrics>

.A        D             G  D    A
 Well the sun is surely sinkin' down
.        Em      Hm     A  G   Em A
 And the moon is slowly risin'  
.   D                   G        D        A
 So this old world must still be spinnin' round
.    Em Hm    A    G   DAD
 And I  still love you   

[C
.   G     F#   A
 So close your eyes
.C                  G              Hm
 You can close your eyes, it's all right
.Em              A
 I don't know no love songs
.    C                G         Hm
 And I can't sing the blues any more
.    Em    F#m7      G
 But I can sing this song
.    Em      F#m7      G
 And you can sing this song
.A        Hm    Em F#m7 G A
 When I'm gone.

.A  D               G     D       A
 It won't be long before another day
.Em       Hm     A    G    Em A
 We gonna have a good time  
.    D              G         D     A
 And no one's gonna take that time away
.Em      Hm      A           G      DAD
 You can stay as long as you like

.G   D G C G D G
               
.      D             G
 Long ago life was clean
.         C         G
 Sex was bad and obscene
.         D            G
 And the rich were so mean
.         D             G
 Stately homes for the Lords
.          C              G
 Croquet lawns, village greens
.      D           G
 Victoria was my queen

;CHORUS:
.  G    D   Em   Bm        D     G
 Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria

 I was born, lucky me
 In a land that I love
 Though I am poor, I am free
 When I grow I shall fight
 For this land I shall die
 Let her sun never set ...

;CHORUS TWICE

;BRIDGE:
.Em                  D
 Land of hope and gloria
.  D            C
 Land of my Victoria
.Em                 D
 Land of hope and gloria
.  D            C
 Land of my Victoria
.     D      G
 Victoria, toria

;SOLO (OVER VERSE CHORDS)
 CHORUS (hold the first two "Victoria"s longer)

 Canada to India
 Australia to Cornwall
 Singapore to Hong Kong
 )From the West to the East
 )From the rich to the poor
 Victoria loved them all ...

;CHORUS
.  G    D   Em  Bm     D             G

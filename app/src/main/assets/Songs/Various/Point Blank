.             c#m                                    f#m
 Do you still say your prayers little darlin' do you go to bed at night
.B                          A
 Prayin' that tomorrow everything will be alright
.       c#m                        f#m
 Well tomorrow's fall in number in number one by one
.    B                                  A
 You wake up and you're dying you don't even know what from

.              E                    B           c#m
 They shot you point blank you been shot in the back
.     B                    A
 Baby point blank you been fooled this time that's a fact
.    E           B                 c#m       B          c#m
 Yea point blank right between the eyes baby point blank

 You grew up where young girls they grow up fast
.    f#m
 You left behind what you asked
.B
 What they asked baby wasn't right
.    A
 you didn't have to live that life
.     c#m
 Well you're gonna be my Juliet
.      f#m
 These days wait on that welfare check
.       B                                              A
 and on all the pretty things you'll never have and on all the promises

.                   E               B                c#m
 That always end up point blank yea shot between the eyes
.B                A                                     E
 Point blank like little white lies we tell to ease the pain
.       B              c#m         B
 You're walkin' in the sights baby point blank
.A                                     c#m
 one false move and baby the lights go out

;BREAK
.  c#m     f#m     B       A

.c#m                                   f#m
 Once I dreamed we were together again baby you and me
.     B                           A
 Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be
.        c#m
 We were standin' at the bar it was hard to hear
.             f#m
 The band was playin' you were shoutin' somethin' in my ear
.              B
 You pulled my jacket off as the drummer counted four
.            A
 You took my hand and pulled me out on the floor
.         c#m
 You just stood there and you started dancin' slow
.      f#m
 And I swore I'd never let you go

.       B
 Well I saw you last night out on the avenue
.     A
 Your face was in the shadows but it was you
.         c#m
 You were standin' in the doorway out of the rain
.           f#m
 You didn't answer when I called out your name
.         B
 You just turned and then you looked away
.     A
 like just another stranger waitin' to get blown away

.E              B                 c#m
 Point blank oh right between the eyes
.     B               A                                  E
 Baby point blank yea right between the pretty lies they tell
.            B                         c#m
 Ah you been shot straight through the heart

.    B                       A
 Yea point blank you've been twisted up till you've become
.             E
 just another part of it baby
.       B                c#m
 You're walkin' in their sights
.   B               A                                     E
 Ah point blank yea one false move and baby the lights go out

;FADE OUT
.  E       B   c#m B       A         c#m

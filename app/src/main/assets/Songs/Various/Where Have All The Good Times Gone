[Intro]           (crashing)

.      G            F                G             F
 Well, in my life I never stopped to worry 'bout a thing
.G           F                G            F
 Open up and shout it out and never try to sing
.C                   A    G
 Wondering if I done wrong
.     F                        D
 Will this impression last too long?        But...

;Chorus:
.          G      F
 Won't you tell me
.G                  F          G    F
 Where have all the good times gone?
.G                  F          G    F
 Where have all the good times gone?

.      G              F             G               F
 Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same
.G              F              G             F
 Time was on my side and I had everything to gain
.C              A        G
 Let it be like yesterday
.F                        D
 Please let me have happy days        And...

;Chorus

.G            F               G                   F
 Ma &amp; Pa look back at all the things they used to do
.G              F              G               F
 Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
.C                    A   G
 Daddy didn't have no toys
.F                        D
 And Mommy didn't need no boys.

.G             F            G               F
 Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
.G                  F                  G      F
 But lets face it - things are so much easier today
.C                            A   G
 Guess you need some bringin' down
.F                             D
 And get your feet back on the ground

;Intro
.B  E/G#  B  E  B  C#   A   G F#
                              

;Verse
.B               E/G#              B                       E/G#
   Come up to my lighthouse for I have something I wish to say
.B                   C#             A            G       F#
   It can wait for a moment well in fact it can wait all day
.B                  E/G#                 B                           E/G#
   I just wanted to bring you up here so you could have the chance to see
.B                    C#        A              G          F#
   The beauty of the situation that you could share with me

;CHORUS
.G#m               A         B                A
     It may seem strange to talk of love and then lighthouses
.G#m            F#       E
     It's not strange to me ey hey hey
.G#m       A    B            A
     All alone you and I in our high tower
.G#m            F#     E  F#          B
     That's the way to be    hey hey hey.

;Intro again

;Verse 2
 Some laugh at my lighthouse they say that it's just an ivory tower
 But I don't mind because I know their envy grows by the hour
 See I have the purpose up here to guide the ships upon their way
 All this is mine it could be yours too, what do you say

;Chords to verse

 Put your glad rags on and join me, hon',

.            A7
 We're gonna rock around the rock tonight,

 We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad day light,

 We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight.

 When the clock strikes two, and three, and four,
 If the band slows down we'll yell for more,
[C
 We're gonna rock around the clock tonight,
 We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad day light,
 We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight.
[

 When the chimes ring five, and six, and seven,
 We'll be rockin' up in seventh heav'n,
[C
 We're gonna rock around the clock tonight,
 We're gonna rock, rock, rock, 'til broad day light,
 We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight.

;verse (lots of Eb7 riffs all over the place)

.Eb7
 Something in me, dark and sticky
 All the time it's getting strong
 No way of dealing with this feeling
 Can't go on like this too long

;bridge:
.Eb
 This time you've gone too far
.Eb
 This time you've gone too far
.Eb
 This time you've gone too far,
.  Eb
 I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you

.                Gb/Eb Db/Eb Gb/Eb            Ab/CAbsus4/Db Ab/Db
 Don't talk back,          just drive the car         
.                Gb/Eb Db/EbGb/Eb                   Ab/CAbsus4/Db Ab/Db
 Shut your mouth,               I know what you are         
.                   Gb/EbDb/EbGb/Eb                           Ab/CAbsus4/Db
 Don't say nothing,              keep your hands on the wheel     
.Ab/Db              Gb/Eb Db/Eb Gb               Ab/CAbsus4/Db
 Don't turn around,             this is for real     

;chorus:
[C]
.Bbm     Ab
 Digging in the dirt
.Db        Gb   Db/F     Ab
 Stay with me I need support
.Bbm         Ab
 I'm digging in the dirt
.Db       Gb     Db/F  Ab
 Find the places I got hurt
.Bbm         Gb     Db/F  Ab
 Open up the places I got hurt
[]

 The more I look, the more I find
 As I close on in, I get so blind
 I feel it in my head, I feel it in my toes
 I feel it in my sex, that's the place it goes

;bridge
;chorus (2x)

 Digging in the dirt, to find the places we got hurt...
;Eb7 riffs, repeat to end</lyrics>

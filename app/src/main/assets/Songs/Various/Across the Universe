.D                                  F#m
 Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
.     Em7                               A                  A7
 They slither while they pass they slip away across the Universe.
.D                                 F#m
 Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
.   Em7            Gm
 Possessing and caressing me

;Chorus
.D             Em7/A A7
 Jai Guru Deva Om nothing's gonna change my world,
.G                                A7
 Nothing's gonna change my world, nothing's gonna change my world,
.G                         D
 Nothing's gonna change my world

.D                            F#m                            Em7
 Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
.                       A             A7
 They call me on and on across the Universe.
.D                                F#m
 Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
.     Em7                               A                 A7
 They tumble blindly as they make their way across the Universe.

;Chorus

.D                                     F#m
 Sounds of laughter, shades of joy are ringing through my opened ears
.  Em7          A      A7
 Inciting and inviting me.
.D                            F#m                             Em7
 Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
.                        A            A7
 And calls me on and on across the Universe

.C      Em       Bb      F     G   G7    G+ G
 I get high when i see you go by,   my-oh-my

 When you sigh my my inside just flies, butterflies
.  F          G              C      Am
 Why am i so shy when i'm beside you
.            Bb              G
 It's only love and that is all
.               C             Am
 Why should i feel the way i do?
.            Bb             G
 It's only love and that is all
.              F           G
 But it's so hard, loving you.

 2. Is it right that you and i should fight every night
 Just the sight of you makes night time bright, very bright
 Haven't i the right to make it up, girl
 It's only love and that is all,
 Why should i feel the way i do?
 It's only love and that is all
.             F            G
 But it's so hard, loving you,
.          F                G           C Am C Am
 Yes it's so hard, loving you, loving you.

;  P.S. When playing the C-Em-...-G+-G sequence, be sure to emphasize
;       the line of notes  C-B-Bb-A-G-F-D#-D (use sort of a "base-strum"
;       technique). Do something similar for the C-Am-C-Am-C sequence at
;       the end.</lyrics>

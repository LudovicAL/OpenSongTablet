.                G                 C     D       G
 Well, if you're travellin' in the north country fair,
.G
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
.            C                G
 Remember me to one who lives there
.G              C    D       G
 She once was a true love of mine.

 Well, if you go in the snowflake storm
 When the rivers freeze and summer ends
 Please see she has a coat so warm
 To keep her from the howlin' winds.

 Please see for me if her hair hangs long
 If it rolls and flows all down her breast,
 Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
 That's the way I remember her best.

 I'm a wonderin' if she remembers me at all
 Many times I've often prayed
 In the darkness of my night
 In the brightness of my day.

 So if you're travellin' in the north country fair,
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
 Remember me to one who lives there,
 She once was a true love of mine.</lyrics>

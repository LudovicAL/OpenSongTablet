 I woke up this morning and the sun was gone, 
 Turned on some music to start my day,
 And lost myself in a familiar song.
.                      C9            G/BAm Em/G D
 I close my eyes and I slip away...

 It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
 When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
 And I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
.        G            C      Eb
 'Till I see Marianne walk a-way,
.Em7    Asus4  A   A2  A
 I see my Marianne walking away.

.G  D/F# Em7 D
         
 So many people have come and gone,
 Their faces fade as the years go by;
 Yet I still recall as I wander on, as clear as the sun
 In the summer sky.

;chorus
.Bm  A  G D/F#  Asus4 A
          Hey!

 When I'm tired and thinking cold,
 I hide in my music, forget the day and
 Dream of a girl I used to know
.                                   G/BCsus2 A
 I closed my eyes and she slips away.

  She slipped    away

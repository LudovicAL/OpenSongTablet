.C                     Em        C                     E
 Those words are all remainders, echoes growing in the heart of twilight
.Gm7           Dm            Gm7   Dm
 They lay back laughing at naivety star
.C                    Em    C                     E
 Awaken all those whispers, the dusty shadow of a passing favour
.Gm7        Dm                Gm7         Dm     Gm7        Dm          C
 I wouldn't say that you were ruthless or right, I couldn't see from so far

.F                   C                       E                              Am
 Was I chasing after rainbows? One thing for sure you never answered when I called
.F                    D                      E                          Am
 And I wiped away the water from my face, to look through the eyes of a stranger
[C
.    Fmaj7          Fm             G             D                         Am
 For rumours in the wake of such a lonely crowd, trading in my shelter for danger
.    Fmaj7       Fm               G                     Dsus    D          Am
 I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down, in the eyes of a stranger

.C                          Em       C                             E
 Can't tell the real from reflection when all these faces look the same to me
.Gm7      Dm          Gm7      Dm
 In ev'ry city such a desolate dream
.C                        Em       C                             E
 Some days are strange to numbers, some say the seventh sounds a little bit stranger
.Gm7       Dm                    Gm7           Dm  Gm7          Dm              C
 A year of Sundays seems to have drifted right by, I could have sworn in one evening

.F                          C                  E                            Am
 And I'm not seized in desperation, No steel reproaches on the table from before
.F                          D                   E                          Am
 But I still can feel those splinters of ice, I look through the eyes of a stranger

 I must be chasing after rainbows, One thing for sure you never answered when I called
.F                    D                      E                          Am
 And I wiped away the water from my face, to look through the eyes of a stranger

 For rumours in the wake of such a lonely crowd, trading in my shelter for danger.
.    Fmaj7       Fm               G              D                   Am
 I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down, walking away like a stranger
.     Fmaj7          Fm             G             D                         Am
 From rumours in the wake of such a lonely crowd, trading in my shelter for danger
.    Fmaj7       Fm               G                     Dsus    D             Am

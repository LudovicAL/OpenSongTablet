.C                   E7#9
  Some folks like to get away
.       Am7              Gm7           C7
 Take a holiday from the neighbourhood 
.F                  A7              Dm7        Bb9
  Hop a flight to Miami Beach Or to Hollywood. 
.C        E7#9      Am7       Cmaj7
  But I'm  takin' a Greyhound 
.       F      C         D7
 On the Hudson River line
.Fmaj7    G9sus             Am7  D7 Am G G9sus
 I'm in a New York state of mind    

 I've seen all the movie stars
 In their fancy cars and their limousines
 Been high in the Rockies under the evergreens.
 But I know what I'm needin'
 And I don't want to waste more time
.                           Am7  GE7#9
 I'm in a New York state of mind  

.Am7        D7          Gmaj7
  It was so easy livin'  day by day
.Gm7           C9                   Fmaj7
  Out of touch  with the rhythm and blues
.Bm7        E7            Amaj7
  And now I need a little  give and take
.    Am7      D7
 The New York Times
.    Gmaj7      Dm7 G7sus G7
 The Daily News   

 Comes down to reality
 And it's fine with me, 'cause I let it slide
 don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
 I don't have any reasons
 I've left them all behind
.                                C
 I'm in a New York state of mind 
.E7#9 Am7 Bb Eb6 Ab Dm7 Db9 Cmaj9</lyrics>

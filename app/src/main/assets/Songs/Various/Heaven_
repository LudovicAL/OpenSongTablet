.C   Am                     G
 Oh, thinking about all our younger years
.          Dm           Am
 There was only you and me,
.        Dm                 G
 we were young and wild and free

.C    Am                    G
 Now, nothing can take you away from me
.           Dm               Am
 We've been down that road before
.           Dm                    G
 But that's over now, you keep me comin' back for more

[C]
.F           G          Am
 Baby you're all that I want
.            C                F
 When you're lying here in my arms
.F              G         Am             G
 I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven

.F           G          Am
 And love is all that I need
.      C                     F
 And I found it here in your heart
.F            G       Am           G
 It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven
[]

.C   Am                    G
 Oh, once in your life you find someone
.         Dm               Am
 Who will turn your world around
.          Dm                     G
 Bring you up when you're feeling down

.C     Am                            G
 Yeah, nothing could change what you mean to me
.           Dm                Am
 Oh there's lots that I could say
.         Dm                      G
 But just hold me now, 'cause our love will light the way

;chorus

.Dm                       F
 I've been waiting for so long
.    C            Am
 For something to arrive
.    Dm            G
 For love to come along

.Dm                        F
 Now our dreams are coming true
.            C                  Am
 Through the good times and the bad
.G
 Yeah, I'll be standing there by you

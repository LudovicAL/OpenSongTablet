.Am        Am7          D
 Say, say, say what you want,
.    Dm7                      Am
 but don't play games with my affection.
.Am          Am7           D
 Take, take, take what you need,
.    Dm7                       Am
 but don't leave me with no direction.

.Dm                    F
 All alone, I sit home by the phone,
.            Am
 waiting for you, baby.
.Dm
 Through the years,
.            F
 how can you stand to hear,
.            E
 my pleading for you dear?
 You know I'm crying Ooh ooh ooh ooh.

.Am      Am7           D
 Go, go, go  where you want,
.    Dm7                 Am
 but don't leave me here forever.
.Am        Am7       D
 You, you, you stay away,
.   Dm7                  Am
 so long girl, I see you never.

.     Dm
 What can I do
.            F
 girl to get through to you?
.        Am
 Cause I love you baby.
.   Dm                       F
 Standing here, baptisted in all my tears,
.     E
 baby through the years,
 You know I'm crying Ooh ooh ooh ooh.

.    Am
 You never worry,
.    G                Am
 and you never shed a tear.
.    Am                 Am
 You saying that my love ain't real,
.     E
 just look at my face,
 these tears ain't drying

.Am        Am7           D
 You, you, you can never say,
.     Dm7                        Am
 that I'm not the one who really loves you.
.  Am          Am7        D
 I pray, pray, pray every day
.     Dm7                          Am
 that you'll see things, girl like I do.

.A
 You keep sayin' you got something for me
 Somethin' you call love but confess
.D
 You been messin' where you shouldn't been messin'
.        A
 And now someone else is getting all your best

[C
.      C                   A           C                       A
 These boots were made for walking 'n' that's just what the'll do
.C                       A
 One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
[

.A
 You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'
 You keep losing when you oughta not bet
.D
 You keep samein' where you oughta be changin'
.           A
 Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet

;Chorus

.A
 You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
 You keep thinking that tou'll never get burned
.D
 I just found me a brand new box of matches
.    A
 And what she knows you ain't got time to learn

;Chorus</lyrics>

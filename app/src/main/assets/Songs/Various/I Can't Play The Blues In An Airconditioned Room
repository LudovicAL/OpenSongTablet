;intro
.F

 All my life I had to struggle, I paid some heavy dues
 Squeekin' out a livin', playin' easy blues
 Then one day my music made me a millionaire
 I bought a big old mansion with central heated air
.    Bb
 Now I got more money than I know how to use
.    F
 Got everything a man could want, but I ain't got no blues
.   C
 Success for me could only lead to my immediate doom
.         F
 'cause I can't play the blues in an airconditioned room

;horns

 Now I was doin' better with a smaller piece of pie
 But all my fame and fortune I can't identify
 I lost the inspiration that came natural in the start
 I have to have a mean old woman, just to break my heart
 Now my life's too easy, I'd be getting soft
 I used to play the blues all day, but now I just play golf
 Now all my pain is rearranged, my life is changes too
 'cause I can't play the blues in an airconditioned room

.G                        Bb                           C     F
 You know what I'm saying  It's kinda hard to play the blues 
;horns

 You might think I'm crazy, you might think I'm strange
 The first thing in the morning I'm gonna make a change
 I throw away my money, I move back to that shag
 Do whatever I gotta do to get that old feelin' back
 I know I'd be feelin' better with nothing left to lose
 When times are bad, the less I had, the better I played the blues
 I buy myself some turkey and wine, and howl it at the moon
 'cause I can't play the blues in an airconditioned room

.   C
 If I should die tomorrow you can write it on my tomb
.    F
 "He couldn't play the blues in an airconditioned room"

;horns
 Whooo-ooh! See what I'm sayin?
;improvise 'till fade</lyrics>

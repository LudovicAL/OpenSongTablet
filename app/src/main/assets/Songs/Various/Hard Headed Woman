.Dm    G                         C
   I'm looking for a hard headed woman
.Cm                F        Dm  Am
   One who'll take me for myself
.Bb         G       C           F
   And if I find my hard headed woman
.Bb           C        F         Am
   I won't need nobody else, no, no, no

 I'm looking for a hard headed woman
 One who'll make me do my best
 And if I find my hard headed woman
 I know the rest of my life will be blessed, yes, yes, yes

.Dm   G                  C
   I know a lot of fancy dancers
.Cm               F              Dm   Am/F
   People who can glide you on a floor
.Bb        F          Bb          F    C
   They move so smooth but have no answers
.Gm            C                          F Am
   When you ask "why'd you come here for?"  
.Am             D              Am
   I know, many fine feathered friends
.          D               F       E         A
 but their friendliness depends on how you do

.Dm     G                        C
   I'm looking for a hard headed woman
.Cm               F           Dm  AmF
   one who'll make me feel so good  
.Bb     F  Bb            F      C
   And if I find my hard headed woman
.Gm          C                  F            Am
   I know my life will be as it should, yes, yes, yes

.D
 There's a new guy in town
 He's been dragging around
.G        A         D
 He's the figure of youth
.D
 And his eyes are so blue
 And they're looking at you
.G  A           D
 So tell me the truth

.G     A              D          G
 Well, well, he's got stories to tell
.G            A            D
 He bites off more than he chews
.G     A           D            G
 Well, well, is he ringing your bell
.G           A           D
 My heart is breaking in two

 And his skin is so fair
 And it shines like his hair
 As he stands so aloof
 With an indolent air
 And an insolent stare
 That just shutters the truth

 Well, well, is he ringing your bell
 My heart is breaking in two
 Well, well, he'll be rotting in hell
 For playing the devil with you

.Bm      G
 Is it already too late
.Bm       G
 No point shutting the gate
.Bm               G
 Have you already swallowed the bait
.           A   ring out
 and you're gone

 As he knocks you down cool
 As you lose all control
 To this slip of a youth
 I see fire in his eyes
 I see ice in his smile
 And I'm learning the truth

 Well, well, he's got stories to tell
 Of love that is long overdue
 Well, well, who is under his spell
 Is paying the devil his due</lyrics>

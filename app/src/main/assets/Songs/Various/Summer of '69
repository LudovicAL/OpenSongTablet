.D
 I got my first real six-string
.A
 Bought it at a five-and-dime
.D
 Played it til my fingers bled
.A
 It was the summer of 69

 Me and some guys from school
 had a band and we tried real hard
 Jimmy quit and Jody got married
 I shoulda known we'd never get far

;Chorus
.G         A
 Oh when I look back now
.D                     G
 that summer seemed to last forever
.G           A
 Oh and if I had a choice
.D        G
 Yeah I'd always wanna be there
.G              A               D
 Those were the best days of my life

 Ain't no use in complainin'
 when you got a job to do
 Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
 and that's where I met you

;Chorus
 Standin on your mama's porch
 you told me that you'd wait forever
 Oh and when you held my hand
 I knew that it was now or never
.               A               D     D  Dsus2 D Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
 Those were the best days of my life                    
.A  Asus2 A     Asus4A      Asus2  A  D
                back in the summer of '69

 Man we were killing time
.        C                     Bb          F
 we were young and restless we needed to unwind
.        Bb                  C             D
 I guess nothin' can last forever- forever;no

.D  Dsus2 D Dsus4 D Dsus2 D A Asus2 A Asus4 A Asus2 A
                                          
 And now the times are changing
 look at everything thats come and gone
 Sometimes when I play that old six-string
 I think about you wonder what went wrong

;Chorus
 Standin' on your mama's porch
 you told me it would last forever
 oh the way you held my hand
 I knew that it was now or never
 Those were the best days of my life

 Back in the summer of 69</lyrics>

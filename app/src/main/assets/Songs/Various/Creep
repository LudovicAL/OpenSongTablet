.              G
 When you were here before,
.                         B
 Couldn't look you in the eye,
.                    C
 You're just like an angel
.                   Cm
 Your skin makes me cry,
.                 G
 You float like a feather,
.               B
 In a beautiful world.
.                 C
 And I wish I was special,
.               Cm
 You're so very special.

[C]

.          G            B
 But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
.                   C
 What the hell am I doing here?
.          Cm
 I don't belong here.
[]

 I don't care if it hurts
 I want to have control,
 I want a perfect body,
 I want a perfect soul,
 I want you to notice,
 When I'm not around,
 You're so very special,
 I wish I was special.

;chorus

 She's running out again,
 She's running out
 She's run run run running out...

 Whatever makes you happy,
 Whatever you want,
 You're so very special,
 I wish I was special...

;chorus
 I don't belong here.</lyrics>

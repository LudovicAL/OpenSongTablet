.D      A/D               D          G/D             A/D
 Now my grandfather was a sailor, he blew in off the water
.D               A/D         G/D           A/D
 My father was a farmer and I, his only daughter,
.D               A/D                  G/D            A/D
 took up with a no-good millworking man from Massachusetts
.    D                  A/D         G/D                   A/D       D
 who dies from too much whiskey and leaves me these three faces to feed
.D Csus2 G6/B A7sus4
              

.A/D               D   G/D             A/D
 Mill-work ain't easy; mill-work ain't hard
.D                   A/D            G/D          A/D
 Mill-work, it ain't nothing but an awful boring job
.    D             A/D          G/D                 A/D
 I'm waiting for a day dream to take me through the morning
.    D             A/D               G/D          A/D            D
 and put me in my coffee break where I can have a sandwich and remember

.          C(addD)                   G6/B
 Then it's me and my machine for the rest of the morning
.        Gm/Bb                 A7sus4
 for the rest of the afternoon 
.                    D          C/D D C/D
 and the rest of my life              

 Now my mind begins to wander to the days back on the farm
 I can see my father smiling at me, swingin' on his arm
 I can hear my grand-dad's stories of the storms out on Lake Erie
 where vessels and cargos and fortunes and sailor's lives were lost

 Yes, but it's my life has been wasted, and I have been the fool
 to let this manufacture use my body for a tool.
 I can ride home in the evening, staring at my hands
 swearing by my sorrow that a young girl ought to stand a better chance

.   C(addD)                      G6/B
 So may I work the mills just as long as I am able
.    Gm/Bb                    A7sus4              D
 and never meet the man whose name is on the label
.      C(addD)                   G6/B
 It be me and my machine for the rest of the morning
.        Gm/Bb                 A7sus4
 for the rest of the afternoon 
.                    D          C/D D C/D
 and the rest of my life</lyrics>

;Beatles

.Dm
 Here come old flat top, He come grooving up slowly,
.Dm
 He got Joo Joo eyeball, He one holy roller
.       A7
 He got hair down to his knee;
.G7
 Got to be a joker, he just do what he please.

;Play riff

.Dm
 He wear no shoe shine, he got toe jam football
.Dm
 He got monkey finger, he shoot co-ca cola
.        A7
 He say, "I know you, you know me."
.G7
 One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
.     Bm              G
 Come Together, Right now, over me

;Play riff

.Dm
 He bag production, He got wal-rus gumboot
.Dm
 He got O-no sideboard, He one spinal cracker
.       A7
 He got feet down below his knee
.G7
 Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease
.     Bm              G
 Come together, right now,  over me

;Play riff

.Dm
 He roller coaster, he got early warning
.Dm
 He got muddy water, He one Mo-jo filter
.        A7
 He say, " One and one and one is three."
.G7
 Got to be good looking 'cause he so hard to see
.     Bm
 Come together, Right now, over me</lyrics>

.G       D        Em        C              G       D          C           G
.G       D        Em        C              G       D          C           Gm

[V1]                                                                         
.       D                     Em                         C             G          D
 In the year of `39 assembled here the volunteers in the days when the lands were few
.         Em          Em7          C                        G        D          G
 Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn, the sweetest sight ever seen

.G       D                          B7                         Em                  Am
 And the night followed day and the story tellers say that the score brave souls inside
.    G                        D                     C            Em    C     D             G     D
 For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried.

.          G                          C          G                              D
 Don't you hear my call though you're many years away don't you hear me calling you
.           G       G/F#   Em   D       C     C/B       Am
 Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
.       G             D             G
 In the land that our grandchildren knew

[V2]
.       D                  Em                             C          G         D
 In the year of `39 came a ship in from the blue the Volunteers came home that day
.         Em         Em7       C                                G         D       G
 And they bring good news of a world so newly born though their hearts so heavily weigh
.        D                           B7                         Em               Am
 For the earth is old and grey, to a new home we'll away but my love this cannot be
.       G                               D
 For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
.              C            D           G    D
 Your mother's eyes in your eyes cry to me   

[C2]
.          G                          C          G                              D
 Don't you hear my call though you're many years away don't you hear me calling you
.        G       G/F#   Em   D      C       C/B       Am
 All the letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
.       Em          D         G
 For my life still ahead pity Me</lyrics>

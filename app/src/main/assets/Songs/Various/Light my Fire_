.Am7                            F#m7
 You know that it would be untrue
.Am7                             F#m
 you know that it would be a lie 
.Am7                    F#m
 if i was to say to you 
.Am7                           F#m7
 girl we couldn't get much higher

;Chorus:
.G            A
 Come on baby light my fire
.G            A             D
 Come on baby light my fire 
.G            A            E
 Try to set the night on fire

.Am7                           F#m7
 The time to hesitate is through
.Am7                         F#m7
 no time to wallow in the mire
.Am7                       F#m
 try now we can only loose 
.Am7                            F#m7
 and our love become a funeral pyre

;Chorus
.F               C
 try to set the night on fire
.F               C
 try to set the night on fire</lyrics>

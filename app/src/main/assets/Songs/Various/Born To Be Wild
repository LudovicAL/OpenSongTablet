;Guitar over E/Em

.Em
 Get your motor runnin'
 Head out on the highway
 Lookin' for adventure
 In whatever comes our way

;Chorus - part 1:
[C]
.G     A             E
 Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
.G        A          E
 Take the world in a love embrace
.G    A          E                G   A        E
 Fire all of the guns at once and explode into space
[]

.Em
 I like smoke and lightnin'
 Heavy metal thunder
 Wrestlin' with the wind
 And the feelin' that I'm under

;Chorus - part 1

;Chorus - part 2:
[C]
.       E
 Like a true nature's child
.        G
 We were born, born to be wild
.         A              G             Em
 We could climb so high, I never wanna die
.E          D     E     D
 Born to be wild,       
.E          D     E     D
 Born to be wild,

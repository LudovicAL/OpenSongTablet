;Oasis
; Use barre chords throughout, A forms for C, B, C#, and As in the choruse,
; E forms for E, G# and As in verses.

;Chorus:
.E         G#              C#          A
 Theres no need for you to say you're sorry
.C            B    E
 Goodbye I'm going home
.E        G#              C         A
 I don't care no more so dont you worry
.C           B     E
 Goodbye I'm going home

.E                  A
 I hate way that even though you
.E                       A
 Know you're wrong you say you're right
.E                               A
 I hate the books you read and all your friends
.F#                               G#
 Your musics shite it keeps me up all night

;Chorus

 I hate the way that you are so sarcastic
 and you're not very bright
 You think that everythings you've done's fantastic
 your music's s***e it keeps me up all night

 E, G#, C#, A x 2

.G#m            C#m               A             E
 And it will be nice to be alone for a week or two
.G#m            C#m               A             E
 But I know that soon enough I'll be right back here with you
.C#        B          A         G
 with you, with you, with you, with you
.C#         B         A         G
 with you, with you, with you, with you

;Then play the Chorus again but draw out the last three chord changes.</lyrics>

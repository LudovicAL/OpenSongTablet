 Sally called when she got the word
.C                               D        G    D
 She said I suppose you've heard - About Alice 
.       G
 Well I rushed  to the window, well I looked outside
.C                               D7
 I could hardly believe my eyes, As a big limousine
.          G              D
 rolled up to Alices drive

[C
.G
 I don't know why she's leaving or where she's gonna go
.  C
 I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
.         D                                               G     D7
 'Cos for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice 
.G                                            C
 Twenty four years waiting for the  chance to tell her how I feel
.                                        D
 And maybe get a second glance, now I've got to get used to
.    C                   G
 not living next door to Alice
[

 We grew up together,two kids in the park
 We carved our initials - deep into the bark -Me and Alice
 Now she walks through the door,her head held high
 Just for a moment I caught her eye - The big limousine
 Pulled out of Alices drive

;Chorus

 Sally called back and asked how I felt
 And she said-Hey, I know how to help - get over Alice
 She said Alice is gone, but I'm still here
 You know I've been waiting for twenty four years
 And the big limousine Disappeared

;Chorus

;END on
.                             G DC G

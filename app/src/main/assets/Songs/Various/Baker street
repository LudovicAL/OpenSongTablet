;Saxophone over D   C G  D chord sequence
.A
 Winding your way down on Baker Street
.A
 Lite in your head, and dead on your feet
.       Em                   G
 Well another crazy day, you drink the night away
.    D
 And forget about everything

.A
 This city desert makes you feel so cold, its got
.A
 So many people but its got no soul
.         Em                   G
 And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong
.         D
 When you thought it held everything.

.Dm7                           Am7
 You used to think that it was so easy
.Dm7                         Am7
 You used to say that it was so easy
.    C             G            D
 But you're tryin, you're tryin now
.Dm7                         Am7
 Another year and then you'd be happy
.Dm7                               Am7
 Just one more year and then you'd be happy
.    C              G            A
 But you're cryin', you're cryin now

 Way down the street there's a light in his place
 You open the door, he's got that look on his face
 And he asks you where you've been, you tell him who you've seen
 And you talk about anything

 He's got this dream about buyin' some land
 He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
 And then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town
 And forget about everything

 But you know he'll always keep moving
 You know he's never gonna stop moving
 Cause he's rollin, He's the rolling stone
 And when you wake up it's a new morning
 The sun is shining it's a new morning
 And you're going, you're going home</lyrics>

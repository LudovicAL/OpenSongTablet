.C                              F
  Why do I feel like I'm losing you?
.C                                  F
  Will it ever recall what I always wanted it to?
.G                F
  Tell me I'm the lucky one,
.G                 F
 - but how you say that
.        G                  Am                   G
 when it breaks my heart to see another one with you?

[C
.F G            Am
 Oooh, lover of mine,
.F G            Am
 Oooh, lover of mine.
.        F        C
 When it hurts so bad
.        G              Am
 I wanna hold you in my arms.
.     G  F                   G
 Make me feel like you wanna be
.         C
 lover of mine.

 After we've said what there is to say
 Am I stealing your heart or am I just in your way?
 Mighty sigh for you is running wild
 Jalousy, dangerous kind,
 when I see you looking at another one that way.

;Chorus

.F                     C
 Please set me free or give me your reason
.F                  Am
 - I try to keep it alive.
.F                    C
 There is no need for us to be lonely
.F                                           G
 - give me some kind of hope, I'm walking on fire.

;Chorus

 Make me feel like you wanna be lover of mine...
 Make me feel like you wanna be lover of mine...

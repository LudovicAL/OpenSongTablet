.      C                      Dm            F
 Bring tea for the tillerman, steak for the sun
.C                                    Bb
 Wine for the women who made the rain come
.F                  C           G                 C       Am
 Seagulls sing your hearts away  'cause while the sinners sin
.    G
 The children play.
.C   Dm            Em         F         G                   Bb
 Oh, Lord how they  and play,  for that happy day, for that happy day</lyrics>

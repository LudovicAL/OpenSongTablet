.E                           D  A   E
 Now I'm not feeding off you I will rearrange your scales
.     G        Gsus4
 If I can and I can
.E                    D A
 Marching the ocean marching to the sea

.              G                         Gsus4
 I had a hat I put it down into some  quicksand
.                G
 Picked it up slapped it on my head
.B
 All the people gather
.Em      Em/F#  Em/G
 Carry each his burden
.        A                 C              Em
 We are young despite the years we are concern
.      E/F#      E/G       A  Asus2
 We are hope despite the times
.Em G             A
 Settle on these days
.       C                 Em
 Happy throngs take this joy wherever, wherever....

 I wish to meet each one of you
 And you meet you if I can and I can
 We have many things in common name three

 Now I'm not feeding off you I will rearrange your scales
 If I can and I can
 I wish to meet each one of you and you me you</lyrics>

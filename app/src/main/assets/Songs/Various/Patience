 Shed a tear 'cause I'm missing you
.    G
 I'm still alright to smile
.A                            D
 Girl I think about you every day now
.C
 Was a time when I wasn't sure
.        G
 but you set my mind at ease
.A                            D
 There is no doubt your in my heart now

[C
.C         G
 Sad woman take it slow
.        C               Em
 It will work itself out fine
.C              G                D
 All we need is just a little (( patience ))
.C         G
 Sad sugar make it slow
.    C                Em
 and we come together fine
.C              G                D
 All we need is just a little (( patience ))
[
 Patience! Ooh - ooh - ooh - ooh - ya - a

 I sit here on the stairs
 'cause I'd rather be alone
 If I can't have you right now
 I'll wait here
 Sometimes I get so tense
 but I can't speed up the time
 but you know love is one more thing to consider

;chorus
 Sad woman take it slow
 and things will be just fine
 You and I just use a little (( patience ))
 Sad sugar take the time
 'cause the lights are shining bright
 You and I got what it takes to (( make it ))

.D
 We won't fake it
.D
 Oh I'll never break it
.D
 'cause I can take it

;guitar solo repeat several times
.C     G     C     Em    C     G     D

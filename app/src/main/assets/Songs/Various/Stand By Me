.          A             F#m
 When the night is cold, and the land is dark
.          D          E7          A
 and the moon is the only light we'll see
.          A                       F#m
 though I won't be afraid tough I won't be afraid
.          D           E7         A
 just as long as you stand, stand by me
 So darlin' darlin' stand by me, oh stand by me
 stand by me, stand by me, stand by me.
 And the sky that we look upon should crumble and fall
 and the mountains should tumble to the sea.
 I won't cry I won't cry, oh I won't shead a tear
 just as long as you stand stand by me.
 So darlin' darlin'......</lyrics>

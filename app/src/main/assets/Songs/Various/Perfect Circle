.F  F/G        D        F   F/G    G
    Put your hair back you get to leave
.F  F/G        D             G
    Eleven gallows on your sleeve
.F   F/G       D    F F/G     G
    Shallow figure winner's pain
.F   F/G     D      F          G      F   Dm7
    Eleven shadows way out of place       
. C            F              C           Dm
 Standing two sure shoulders high in the room

 The last time through this part is :
.C            F              C           F
 Standing two sure shoulders high in the room

 Pull your dress on and stay real close
 Who might leave you where I left off
 A perfect circle of acquaintances and friends
 Drink another coin a phrase
 Heaven assure shoulders high in the room

 Try to win and suit your needs
 Speak out sometimes and try to win
 Standing two ___ shoulders high in the room</lyrics>

;Elvis Costello

.      C        G/B         F/A           C/G
 While Nat King Cole sings "Welcome To My World"
.F                C/E               Dm          E
 You request some song you hate you sentimental fool
.    Em                Am
 And it's the force of habit
.      Em
 If it moves then you fuck it
.      Am
 If it doesn't move you stab it

.      C         G/B        F/A           C/G
 And I thought I heard "The Working Man's Blues"
.F              C/E                 Dm         E7
 He went out to work that night and wasted his breath
.Em                  Am
 Outside there was a public execution
.Em                   Am
 Inside he died a thousand deaths

.         C          G/B        F/A       C/G
 And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
.         C          G/B        F/A       C/G
 And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
.         C          G/B        C/Bb      F/A
 And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
.C/G                   G       C     G/BF/AC/GF  C/EDm C
 And they put him in a suit of lights                  

.       C    G/B   F/A   C/G
 In the perforated first editions
.           F   C/E      Dm        E
 Where they advocate the hangman's noose
.     Em                         Am
 Then tell the sorry tale of the spent Princess
.    Em                Am
 Her uncouth escort looking down her dress

.C          G/B      F/A           C/G
 Anyway they say that she wears the trousers
.    F           C/E            Dm
 And learnt everything that she does
.    E7              C   G/B    C/Bb     F  C/E
 And doesn't know if she should tell him yes
.   F/Eb    Gsus Gsus G
 Or let him go  

.         C          G/B        F/A       C/G
 And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
.         C          G/B        F/A       C/G
 And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
.         C          G/B        C/Bb      F/A
 And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
.C/G                   G         C
 And they put him in a suit of lights

.            G               F C/E G/D C     G             G
 Well it's a dog's life in a rope leash or a diamond collar
.     G                  F     C/E   G/DC
 It's enough to make you think right now
.    F               F
 But you don't bother
.    C        G/B         F/A     C/G
 For goodness sake as you cry and shake
.      F        C/E       Dm                E7
 Let's keep you face down in the dirt where you belong
.    C    G/B C/Bb    F   C/E  F/Eb    Gsus4
 And think of all the pleasure that it brings
.           Gsus4          G
 Though you know that it's wrong

.    G                          F C/E
 And there's still life in your body
.G/D C    G              G
 But most of it's leaving
.G                 F  C/E G/D C
 Can't you give us all a break
.      F                  F
 Can't you stop breathing 

.      C         G/B        F/A           C/G
 And I thought I heard "The Working Man's Blues"
.F         C/E                 Dm        E
 I went to work last night and wasted my breath
.Em                       Am
 Outside they're painting tar on somebody
.Em               Am                              Gsus4 G
 It's the closest to a work of art that they will ever be

.         C      G/B            F/A       C/G
 And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
.         C      G/B            F/A       C/G
 And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
.         C      G/B            C/Bb      F/A
 And they pulled him out of the cold cold ground
.C/G                   G       C
 And they put him in a suit of lights

 repeat ...

.C/G                   G       C     G/BF/A C/G F  C/EDm C
 And they put him in a suit of lights                    
.C  G/B F/AC/GF  C/E Dm C
                        
 repeat ...</lyrics>

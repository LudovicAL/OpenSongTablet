.G              Am      C    G               Am C
 Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts,          
.G                   Am   C       G
 Something's telling me I must go home.
.                                    C
 And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
.          G        D7              G           Am D7
 The day I left her standing on her own.           

.G                Am      C       G          Am C
 Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco,        
.G            Am       C     G
 Gotta do the things I wanna do.
.                                    C
 And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
.                G       D7              G      Am D7
 They brought me back to see my way with you.      

.G              Am      C    G               Am C
 Talk about the life in Massachusetts,          
.G               Am     C      G
 Speak about the people I have seen,
.                                    C
 And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
.         G           D7               G        Am D7
 And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.       

.         Am     C    G
 I will remember Massachusetts...</lyrics>

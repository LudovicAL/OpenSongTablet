 Immanuel Kant was a real piss-ant
.                    A
 Who was very rarely stable
 Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggar
.                              D
 Who could drink you under the table
 David Hume could out-consume
.                   G
 Whilhelm Friedrich Hegel
.    A
 And Wittgenstein was a beery swine
.                           D
 Who was just as sloshed as Schlagel
.                A
 There's nothin' Nature didn't teach yer
 'Bout the raisin' of the wrist
.            D        B7          E7
 Socrates himself was permanently pissed

 John Stuart Mill of his own free will
 On a bottle o' shanty became particularly ill
 Plato they say, could put it away
 Half a pint of whiskey every day
 Aristotle, Aristotle was a bugger for the bottle
 Hobbes was fond of his dram
 And Rene Descartes was a drunken fart
 `I drink therefore I am'

 But Socrates himself is particularly missed
 A lovely little thinker but a bugger when he's pissed</lyrics>

.D   F#m              G/A       D     D/C     G
 The long and winding road that leads to your door
.     D/F#      Bm7    Em7  A7             D7sus   D7
 Will never disappear, I've seen that road before  
.G    D/F# Bm7            Em7     A7      D
 It always leads me here, lead me to your door

.D   F#m            G/A            D    D/C     G
 The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
.    D/F#           Bm    Em7    A7      D7sus    D7
 Has left a pool of tears crying for the day      
.G   D/F#     Bm             Em7    A7       D
 Why leave me standing here? Let me know the way

;Chorus
.D               G              D/F#            Em7    A7
 Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried  
.D             G              D/F#           Em7    A7
 Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried  

.    D          F#m     G/A         D        D/C     G
 But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
.    D/F#             Bm     Em      A7        D7sus    D7
 You left me standing here   a long, long time ago      
.G     D/F#     Bm            Em7     A7      D
 Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to your door

.    D          F#m     G/A         D        D/C     G
 But still they lead me back to the long and winding road

 You left me standing here   a long, long time ago

 Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to your door</lyrics>

.     D                  Gmaj9
 In the chilly hours and minutes
.     D         G Bm       G6
 of uncertainty I want to be
.D                G       A7     D
 in the warm hold of your lovin' mind
.   D             Gmaj9
 To feel you all around me,
.       D             G Bm       G6
 and to take your hand along the sand
.D                    G       A7        D
 Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind

 When sundown pales the sky
 I want to hide a while behind your smile
 And ev'rywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find
 For me to love you now
 would be the sweetest thing t'would make me sing
 Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind

 When rain has hung the leaves with tears
 I want you near to kill my fears
 To help me to leave all my blues behind
 Standin' in your heart
 is where I want to be and long to be
 Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind</lyrics>

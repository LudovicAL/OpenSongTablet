.G        Em           D                    C
 One, two princes kneel before you. (That's what I said, now)
.G        Em               D           C
 Princes, princes who adore you. (Just go ahead now)
.G        Em                 D         C
 One has diamonds in his pockets. (That's some bread now)
.G            Em                   D           C
 This one, he wants to buy you rockets. (Ain't in his head now)

.G     Em         C
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.    Di di ba
.G           Em
 dip. Di dip dip di dip. Be dee-dle-ee
.D                       C
 di ba du ba du ba du ba du ba du ba du ba du ba.

 This one got a princely racket. (That's what I said now)
 Got some big seal up on his jacket (Ain't in his head now)
 Marry him, your father will condone you. (How 'bout that, now?) You
 marry me, your father will disown you. (He'll eat his hat now)

.C                      G
 Marry him or marry me. I'm the one that loves you baby, can't you see? I ain't
.C                                 D
 got no future or family tree, but I know what a prince and lover ought to be.
 I know what a prince and lover ought to be. Said

[C
 If you want to call me baby. (Just go ahead, now) And
 if you want to tell me maybe. (Just go ahead, now) And
 if you wanna buy me flowers. (Just go ahead, now) And
 if you want to talk for hours. (Just go ahead, now)

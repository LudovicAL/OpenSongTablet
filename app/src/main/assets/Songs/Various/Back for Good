;Intro: (D  G  G  D  A) x 2
.D G               G     Asus4 A         D   G               Asus4 A
 I guess, now it's time,  for me to give up, I feel it's time ,
.      D              G                  G                    Asus4 A        D
 Got a picture of you beside me,Got your lipstick marks still on your coffee cup,
.G       G
 Oh yeah,
.Asus4 AD            G              G                 Asus4 A
  Got a fist of your emotion, Got a head of shattered  dreams,
.      Bm              D            G         DA
 Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now 

;Chorus
.D                G                        G
 Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it,
.       Asus4    A        D      D              G              G                 Asus4 A
 I just want you back for good, (want you back, want you back, want you back for good),
.D                   G                              G
 Whenever I'm wrong, just tell me the song and I'll sing it,
.          Asus4     A         D                 G
 You'll be right and understood, (want you back, want you back)
.G                   Asus4 A
 I want you back for good

.D      G                 Asus4   A       D              G               Asus4A
 Unaware but underline, I figured out the story (no no), It wasn't good (no no),
.         D            G                           Asus4     AD
 But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind), I celebrated glory,
.G                Asus4 A
 But that was not to be,
.       D             G                            Asus4 A
 In the twist of separation, you excelled at being free,
.          Bm                             D               G  DA
 Can't you find (can't you find) A little room inside for me  

;Chorus

.Gmaj7        D
 And we'll be together,
.Gmaj7              Dmaj7
 this time it's for ever,
.Bm                      D
 You can't fight it, and forever we will be,
.   Gmaj7            G
 So  complete in our love,
.        G                 A
 We will never be uncommon again

;Chorus

.  G                     D        A        D
 I guess it's time, that you came back for good.</lyrics>

.E              A             E              A
 I can't get no satisfaction  I can't get no satisfaction
.             E              B7             E          A
 Cause I try__   and I try___    and I try__  and try__

 (start main riff)
.A     E               A  D       A       E             A  D
 I can't get no                  I can't get no            

. A    E               A  D        A      E             A  D
 When I'm driving  in my car    and the man comes on the radio
.A     E               A  D        A      E             A  D
 he's telling me more and more   about some useless information
.A      E              A   D       A      E             A  D
 supposed to drive my imagination  I can't get no          

.     A      E    N.C.       E     A  D      A      E         A D
 Oh no  no  no    hey  hey  hey          That's what I say      

 When I'm watchin' my TV and that man comes on to tell me
 how white my shirts can be Well he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
 the same cigarettes as me
 I can't get no oh no no no
 Hey hey hey that's what I say

;Chorus

 When I'm ridin' 'round the world and I'm doin' this and I'm signing that
 And I'm tryin' to make some girl who tells me "Baby better come back next week
 'cause you see I'm on a losin' streak"
 I can't get no oh no no no
 Hey hey hey that's what I say

;Chorus</lyrics>

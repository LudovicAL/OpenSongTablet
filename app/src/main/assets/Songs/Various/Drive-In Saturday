.E      A                             F#m
 Let me put my arms around your head, gee it's hot let's go to bed
.E6
 Don't forget to turn on the light, don't laugh babe it'll be alright
.A                               F#m
 Pour me out another please I'll ring and see if your friends are home
.E6                                       E
 Perhaps the strange ones in the dome can lend us a book
.                         D                            Amaj7
 We can read up alone and try to get it on like once before
.     D                                 A               F#m            B
 When people stared in Jaggers eyes and scored like the video films we saw

;Chorus
.    C        D      G            G7/F      E7     Am     Am/G
 His name was always Buddy and he shrug and ask to stay   
.          D/F#               G              C        G/B   D
 And she'd sigh like Twig the wonder kid and turn her face away
.        C       D      G                    G7        E7     Am           Am/G
 She's uncertain if she likes him though she knows she really loves him    
.       D                    G              C  C/B Am      D/F#   D/E
 It's a crash course for the ravers, it's a drive- in Saturday    

.A                               F#m
 Jung the foreman prayed at work neither hands nor limbs would burst
.     E6
 It's hard enough to keep formation with the fall out saturation
.A                              F#m
 Cursing at the Astronette that stands in still by his cabinet
.    E6                                              E
 His crashing out with sylvian the bureau supply for agreeing men
.     D                                Amaj7
 With snorting head he gives us to the shore
.      D                                  A             F#m            B
 Which once it raised a sea that raged no more like the video films we saw

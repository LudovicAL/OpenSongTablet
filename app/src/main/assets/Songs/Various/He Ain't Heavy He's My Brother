;Intro:
.G  D/F#  C/E  D
               

.G               D/F#         C/E         Am7  D      D/D#  Em        F
 The road is long,with many a winding turn,that leads us to who knows where,
.          Am7 C/D D       G   D/F#                 Em       D#   G
 who knows where,  but i'm strong, strong enough to carry him,    he ain't heavy,
.Am7 C/D       G  Am7 C/D          G  D/F#           C/E      Am7  D   D/D#   Em
       he's my brother,  so on we go, his welfare is my concern, no burden is he,
.   F              Am7 C/D D       G    D/F#            Em      D# G          Am7
 to bear, we'll get there,   for i know, he would not encumber me, he aint heavy,
.C/D          G  Am7
 he's my brother,
.       C         D/C       C            D/C           Bm         Dm
 If i'm leaning at all, i'm leaning with sadness, that everyone's heart,
.      C      B         Em     Em/D  C  C/B Am7    C/D   D
 isn't filled, with the gladness, of love, for one another.
.                 G   D/F#                  C/E   Am7  D          D/D#    Em
 I'ts a long long road, from which there is no return, while we're on the way,
.   F              Am7 C/D D         G  Bm D/F# D  D/F#  D  Em       D#
 to there, why not share,    and the load, doesn't weigh me down, at all,
.G          Am7 C/D          G
 he ain't heavy,     he's my brother,
 he's my brother, he ain't heavy,
 he's my brother, he ain't heavy.</lyrics>

;Intro |:  Eb    E  F     Eb   E  F :| (use barre chords)
.C             Bb                 F
 After all the jacks are in their boxes
.C                   Bb          F
 And the clowns have all gone to bed
.C                      Bb            F
 You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
.G         Bb         Eb E F
 Footsteps dressed in red
.G       Bb            Eb EF Eb E F
 And the wind whispers Mary

.C          Bb       F
 A broom is drearily sweeping
.C                       Bb          F
 Up the broken peices of yesterday's life
.C           Bb       F
 Somewhere a queen is weeping
.G           Bb          Eb EF
 Somewhere a king has no wife
.G            Bb    Eb EF Eb E F
 And the wind cries Mary

;Solo over: |: F  Eb  Bb  Ab :| 3x    G  Bb  Db  F

.C                       Bb     F
 The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
.C                       Bb         F
 And shine the emptyness down on my bed
.C               Bb   F
 The tiny island sags downstream
.G                   Bb       Eb EF
 Cause the life that lived is dead
.G            Bb      Eb EF Eb E F
 And the wind screams Mary

.C             Bb     F
 Will the wind ever remember
.C                Bb           F
 The names it has blown in the past
.C                        Bb           F
 With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
.G                         Bb     Eb EF
 It whispers no, this will be the last
.G            Bb    Eb EF Eb E F Eb E F Eb E F
 And the wind cries Mary</lyrics>

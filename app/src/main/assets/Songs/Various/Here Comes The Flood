;intro:
.Dbsus4 Dbm E/B A
         

.Dbm               Abm/B       A
   When the night  shows   and signals grow on radios

.D                 Abm/B       A
   All the strange things that come and go as early warnings

.B                 B/Ab    A
 Stranded starfish have no place to hide

.      A        Gb/Bb   B       Ab/C   Dbm
 Still waiting  for the swollen Easter tide

.       Dbm7/B                    Gb/Bb  Gbm/A A        E
 Theres no point in direction, we cannot even  choose a side

 I took the old track, the hollow shoulder, across the water,
 On the tall cliffs, they were getting older, sons and daughters,
 The jaded underworld was riding high,
 And waves of steel hurled metal at the sky,
 And as the nails sunk in the cloud,
 The rain was warm and soaked the crowd.

;chorus:
[C]
.E          B/Eb      Dbm
 Lord, here comes the flood

.      B           Ab/C              Dbm
 We'll say goodbye,     to flesh and blood

.   Ab/C                         Dbm
 If again the seas are silent in any still alive

.Ab/C     Ab/Bb     Ab         Ab/Gb  A
 It'll be those who gave their island to survive

.      Am Bm C        D        E
 Drink up,   dreamers,  you're running dry
[]

 When the flood call, you have no home, you have no walls,
 In the thundercrash, you're a thousand minds within a flash,
 Don't be afraid to cry at what you see,
 The actor's gone, there's only you and me,
 And if we break before the dawn, they'll use up what we used to be.

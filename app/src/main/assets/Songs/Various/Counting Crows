;Intro &amp; verse riff:                  (alternate fingering)

.G (riff)
 Step out the front door like a ghost
 into the fog where no one notices the contrast of white on white.
 And in between the moon and you   the angels get a better view
 of the crumbling difference between wrong and right
 I walk in the air between the rain, through myself and back again
 Where?  I don't know
 Maria says she's dying.  Through the door, I hear her crying
 Why?  I don't know

.      C       D               Em        G/D
 Round here we always stand up straight  
.      C    D             Em    G/D
 Round here something radiates  

.G (riff)
 Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
 She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
 She walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
 Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
 She parks her car outside of my house   Takes her clothes off,
 Says she's close to understanding Jesus
 She knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
 She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

.      C          D               Em      G/D
 Round here we're carving out our names   
.      C    D               Em     G/D
 Round here we all look the same   
.      C                      D
 Round here we talk just like lions
.       Em             G/D
 But we sacrifice like lambs
.      C          D                   Em       A  D        A
 Round here she's slipping through my hands    /  /    Oh...

.G/D                      D            A      G/D        D         A
 Sleeping children got to run like the wind   Out of the lightning dream
.G/D                       D           A    G/D        D
 Mama's little baby better get herself in   Out of the lightning

.G (riff)
 She says, "It's only in my head."
 She says, "Shhh...I know it's only in my head."
 But the girl on the car in the parking lot
 says: "Man, you should try to take a shot
 Can't you see my walls are crumbling?"
 Then she looks up at the building   and she says she's thinking of jumping
 She says she's tired of life;   she must be tired of something.

.      C          D            Em     G/D
 Round here she's always on my mind   
.      C    D             Em     G/D
 Round here I got lots of time   
.      C                            D
 Round here we're never sent to bed early
.  Em            G/D
 Nobody makes us wait
.      C               D         Em        G/D
 Round here we stay up very very very very late

.            C        D              Em     G/D
 I can't see nothing, nothing around here   
.                    C                            D
 You catch me if I'm falling, you catch me if I'm falling
.                             Em                 G/D
 Will you catch me 'cause I'm falling down round here

.G (riff)
 I said I'm under the gun round here
 I'm innocent, I'm under the gun round here
 I can't see nothing, nothing round here.

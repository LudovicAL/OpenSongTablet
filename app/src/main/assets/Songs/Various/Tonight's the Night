.C                 Fmaj7
 Stay away from my window
.C                 Fmaj7
 Stay away from my back door too
.C              Fmaj7
 Disconnect the telephone line
.C              Fmaj7           Bbmaj7  G7   F  G/B
 Relax baby and draw that blind                 

.C                       Fmaj7
 Kick off your shoes and sit right down
.C                  Fmaj7
 and loosen up that pretty french gown
.C                 Fmaj7
 Let me pour you a good long drink
.C                   Fmaj7
 Ooh baby, don't you hesitate 'cause
.C                  Fmaj7
 tonight's the night
.C                Am
 It's gonna be allright
.         Dm
 'cause I love you girl
.        Fmaj7                 C    G
 ain't nobody gonna stop us now     

 Come on angel my hearts on fire
 Don't deny your man's desire
 You'd be a fool to stop this tide
 Spread your wings and let me come inside 'cause
 Tonights the night
 It's gonna be allright
 'cause I love you girl
 ain't nobody gonna stop us now

 Don't say a word my virgin child
 just let your inhibitions run wild
 The secret is about to unfold
 upstairs before the nights too old 'cause
 Tonights the night
 It's gonna be allright
 'cause I love you girl
 ain't nobody gonna stop us now</lyrics>

;Verse 1
.D A     D A    D A        D A
 I love,          she makes me
.D          A    D A   D           C
  She is my heart        she is my love
.G          A   D A D A
  She is my love

;Verse 2
.D   A   D A   D          A       D A
  I know,       I'm jealous of her
.D             A    D A  D           C
  She makes me need,       she is my love
.G          A   D A E7
  She is my love

;Chorus:
.A         E           A            D**
 Who knows who'll she make me, as I lie in her cocoon?
.        A          C#7    F#m     B7
 And the world will surely heal my ills
.    D                                A
 I'm warm and terrified, she makes me so

;Verse 3
 I know, the day I leave her
 I'll love her still, she is my love
.          A   E7
 she is my love

;Chorus music:
 Who knows where my dreams will end
 I'll follow as they go
 But the world will know how long I take
 And if I'm very slow, she makes me so.

 Lalalalala la la la ...
.Dm            G                  C
 Now that I've lost everything to you
.            F                     Bb
 You say you wanna start something new
.     Gm                       A
 It's breaking my heart you're leaving, baby I'm breathing
.Dm           G               C
 If you wanna leave take good care
.                F                     Bb
 Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
.           Gm                      A       C
 But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

.F   C                Bb
 Oh, baby baby it's a wild world
.C                Bb             F
 It's hard to get by just upon a smile
.F   C                Bb
 Oh, baby baby it's a wild world
.C                 Bb                  F          Gm
 And I'll always remember you , like a child girl 
[

.Dm                   G                         C
 You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
.         F                    Bb
 And it's breaking my heart in two
.        Gm                  A
 Cause I never wanna see you sad girl, don't be a bad girl
.Dm               G               C
 But if you wanna leave take good care
.                F                       Bb
 Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
.       Gm                      A        C
 Just remember there's a lot of bad everywhere

 Baby I love you
.Dm               G               C
 But if you wanna leave take good care
.                F                       Bb
 Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
.       Gm                      A        C
 Just remember there's a lot of bad everywhere

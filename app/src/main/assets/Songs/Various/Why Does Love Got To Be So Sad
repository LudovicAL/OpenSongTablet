.AmG AmG AmG AmG
               
.AmG AmG AmG AmG
               

.Am                G
  Got to find me a  way
.Am                  G
  To take me back to  yesterday.
.F          C                E
  How can I  ever hope to forget you?

.Am                   G
  Won't you show me a  place
.Am                   G
  Where I can hide my  lonely face?
.F                       C                    E
  I know you're going to  break my heart if I  let you.

.Amaj7                    Dmaj7
  Why does love got to be  so sad?
.Amaj7                    Dmaj7
  Why does love got to be  so sad?
.Amaj7                    Dmaj7
  Why does love got to be  so sad?
.Amaj7                    Dmaj7
  Why does love got to be  so sad?

.Am                G
  Like a moth to a  flame,
.Am               G
  Like a song without a name,
.F           C                      E
  I've never  been the same since I  met you.

.Am                  G
  Like a bird on the  wing,
.Am                    G
  I've got a brand new  song to sing,
.F        C                   E
  I can't  keep from singing about you.

;Chorus

;Solo on Verse Six Times

.Am                G
  I'm beginning to  see
.Am                  G
  What a fool you've  made of me.
.F                C                     E
  I might have to  break the law when I  find you.

.Am             G
  Stop running away;
.Am                 G
  I've got a better  game to play,
.F           C                       E
  You know I  can't go on living without you.

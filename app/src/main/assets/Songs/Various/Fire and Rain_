. A              Em7                 D             A
 Just yesterday mornin' they let me know you were gone,
.             E                   Gmaj7
 Susan, the plans they made put an end to you.
.A                  Em7            D              A
 I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song,
.                E           Gmaj7
 I just can't remember who to send it to.

;Chorus:
.D         Hm7       E7        A
 I've seen fire and I've seen rain,
.        D                  Hm7          E7    A
 I seen sunny days that I thought would never end,
.        D                   Hm7       E7      A
 I seen lonely times when I could not find a friend,
.       G                  Em7     A9   Asus     A
 But I always thought I'd see you again.         

 Won't you look down upon me Jesus, you've got to help me make a stand,
 Just got to see me through another day.
 My body's aching and my time is at hand,
 And I can't make it any other way.

;Chorus.

 Been walkin' my mind to an easy time, my back turned toward the sun,
 Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around.
 Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come,
 Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.

;Chorus.

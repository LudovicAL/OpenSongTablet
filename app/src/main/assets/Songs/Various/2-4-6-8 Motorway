  <lyrics>[V1]
.A                                     E
 Drive my truck midway to the motorway station
.D                        E11                 A
 Fair-lane cruiser coming up on the left hand side
.             E
 Headlights shining, driving rain on the window frame
.D                 E11                 A
 Little young lady stardust hitching a ride

[Chorus]
.A                            E
 And it's two four six eight, never too late
.D               E11                     A
 Me and my radio trucking on through the night
.A                           E
 Three five seven nine, on a little white line
.D                   E11                 A
 Motorway sun coming up with the morning light.

[V2]
 Whizz-kid sitting pretty on your two wheels stallion
 This old ten ton lorry got a bead on you
 Ain't no use setting up with a bad companion
 Ain't nobody got the better of you know who.

;Chorus repeat

[V3]
 Well, there ain't no route you can choose to lose the two of us
 Ain't nobody know when you're acting right or wrong
 No one knows if a roadway's leading nowhere
 Gonna keep on driving on the road I'm on.

;Chorus repeat ad infinitum.</lyrics>

.G                                     Dm7
 Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
.E7-5
 Nothing is real.
.    C          D   E
 And nothing to get hung about.
.Am7              D   G
 Stawberry Fields forever.

.D                   D7        B7
 Living is easy with eyes closed,
.Em                       C
 Misunderstanding all you see.
.Am7          D7             G                    Em
 It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out,
.Am7        D7             C  G  C
 It doesn't matter much to me.   

 Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
 Nothing is real.
 And nothing to get hung about.
 Stawberry Fields forever.

 No one I think is in my tree,
 I mean it must be high or low.
 That is, you know you can't tune in but it's all right,
 That is, I think it's not too bad.

 Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
 Nothing is real.
 And nothing to get hung about.
 Stawberry Fields forever.

 Always know sometimes think it's me,
 But you know I know and it's a dream.
 I think I know of thee, ah, yes but it's all wrong,
 That is, I think I disagree.

 Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
 Nothing is real.
 And nothing to get hung about.
 Stawberry Fields forever.

[Intro]      
.G            Fmaj7       Em
 I slept last night in a good hotel
.       Am         C       F    C
 I went shopping today for jewels
.G                Fmaj7        Em
 The wind rushed around in the dirty town
.        Am            C           F    C
 And the children let out from the schools
.      Am                  G
 I was standing on a noisy corner
.C               G       F C D
 Waiting for the walking green
.G                    Fmaj7         Em
 Across the street he stood, and he played real good
.       Am    C      F C
 On his clarinet for free

.G         Fmaj7     Em
 Now me, I play for fortunes
.        Am     C        F C
 And the velvet curtain calls
.        G          Fmaj7          Em
 I got a black limosine and a few gentlemen
.  Am         C         F  C
 Escorting me to these halls
.         Am                   G
 And I'll play if you have the money
.   C           G          FC D
 Or if you're a friend to me
.G               Fmaj7        Em
 But the one-man-band by the quick lunch stand
.       Am           C        F  C     Em D
 He was playing real good for free        

.G       Fmaj7      Em
 Nobody stopped to hear him
.          Am        C         F  C
 Though he played so sweet and high
.     G           Fmaj7       Em
 They knew he had never been on their TV
.        Am              C     F C
 So they passed his good music by
.  Am                   G
 I meant to go over and ask for a song
.      C        G     FC D
 Maybe put on a harmony
.G           Fmaj7            Em
 I heard his refrain as that signal changed
.     Am      C                     F  C      Em D
 He was still playing real good for free</lyrics>

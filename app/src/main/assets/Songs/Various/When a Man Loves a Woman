 key of C
 intro      C  G/B  Am7  Am/G  F  G  C  G6

.                  C           G/B   Am                        C7/G
 verse1     When a man loves a woman,   can't keep his mind on nothing else
.F                G                             C     G
 He'll trade the world for the good thing he's found  
.         C            G/B    Am                 C7/G
 If she's bad he can't see it      she can do no wrong
.F                     G                         C    G
 Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down  

 verse2     When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime
 Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
 He'd give up all his comfort, sleep out in the rain
 If she said that's the way it ought to be
;Chorus
[C
.F           G            C
  Well, this man loves a woman
.F           G            C
  I gave you everything I had
.F           G         C    E7/B     Am
  Tryin' to hold on to your precious love
.D7                           F/G   G+5
  Baby, please don't treat me bad   
[

 verse3     When a man loves a woman, down deep in his soul
 She can bring him such misery
 If she plays him for a fool, he's the last one to know
 Lovin' eyes don't ever see

;chorus
.                  C           G/B    Am                       C7/G
 outro      When a man loves a woman,    I know exactly how he feels
.    F          G              C     G
 Coz baby baby baby you're my world  
 (repeat outro until tired)</lyrics>

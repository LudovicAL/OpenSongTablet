.            Fm7     Bb7
 Her name is Lola    
.          Ebmaj7
 She was a showgirl
.            Am7-5           D7
 With yellow feathers in her hair
.      Gm7
 And a dress cut down to there
 She would merengue
 And do the cha-cha
 And while she tried to be a star
 Tony always tended bar
.           Cm D7  Gm
 Across the crowded floor
.                  Cm    D7  Gm
 They worked from eight til four
.           Cm                     D7
 They were young and they had each other
.          Gm7 Gbm7 Fm7
 Who could ask for  more

[C]
.       Fm7  Bb7      Ebmaj7
 At the Copa,    Copacabana
.    Fm7     Bb7           Ebmaj7
 The hottest spot north of Havana (,here)
.C7     Fm7  Bb7      Gm7 C7
 At the Copa,    Copacabana
.Fm7        Bb7         Gm7        C7            Fm7     D7
 Music and passion were always in fashion at the Copa

.             Gm7        Gm7 Gbm7 Fm7
 They fell in love...      
.Fm7 Gbm7 Gm7 Gm7 Gbm7 Fm7 Gbm7 Gm7
           
 His name was Rico
 He wore a diamond
 He was escorted to his chair
 He saw Lola dancing there
 And when she finished
 He called her over
 But Rico went a bit too far
 Tony sailed across the bar
 And then the punches flew
 And chairs were smashed in two
 There was blood and a single gunshot
 But just who shot who?

 Her name is Lola
 She was a showgirl
 But that was thirty years ago
 When they used to have a show
 Now it's a disco
 But not for Lola
 Still in the dress she used to wear
 Faded feathers in her hair
 She sits there so refined
 And drinks herself half-blind
 She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
 and she's lost her mind

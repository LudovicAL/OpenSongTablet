.Em     G           D
 20,000 miles to an oasis
.Em     A            G
 20,000 years will I burn
.Em     G           D
 20,000 chances are wasted
.Em              A       G
 Waiting for the road to turn

.C               D
 I would give my life to find it
.Bm
 I would give it all
.C             Am
 Catch me if I fall

 (Verse same as above)

 Walking through the woods I have faced it
 Looking for something to earn
 30,000 thoughts have been wasted
 Never in my time to return

 (Chorus same)

 I would give my life to find it
 I would give it all
 Catch me if I fall

 (Interlude)

.Asus4     G
           

.G   D    G
 All alone
.G          D   Em
 Waiting to fall

 40,000 stars in the evening
 Look at them fall from the sky
 40,000 reasons for living
 40,000 tears in your eye

 I would give my life to find it
 I would give it all

 (End different from usual chorus)

.Em            D
 Catch me if I fall</lyrics>

;INTRO
.G C G C G D C D G
                 

.G                    C         C9           C   G
   The bus is pulling out and I guess I'd better go
.  Am            C                 C9              D   D9
 Before I make a grave mistake and let my feelings show
.G                   C       C9    C        G
   And twenty miles away she waits alone for me
.    Am            C           C9         C     D  D9
 But when I try to picture her you're the one I see
.        C          G                 D    C
 And in another situation I could put up a fight
.    C9          D             G
 But you will be my downfall tonight.

.G                        C     C9      C     G
   So the night is coming down, drowing us in blue
.    Am              C                  C9      C         D D9
 And it all points toward the things we know we shouldn't do
.G                  C       C9         C    G
   And as I look at you and fall under your spell
.       Am               C               C9     C       D    D9
 Well I know I should be thinking of her lying there herself.

.         C              G                            D       C
 And when faced with temptation you know a man should stand a fight
.    Am             D          G
 But you will be my downfall tonight.

.      Hm      Hm7 Hm D              Dsus4 D      Am      Am7
 Be my downfall    be my great regret      be the one girl
.Am   Am7  D          Dsus4
 That I'll   never forget
.Am                    Am7          D      G      C G C C D D G
   Be my undoing be my slow road to ruin tonight.             
.      Hm      Hm7 Hm D              Dsus4 D      Am      Am7
 Be my downfall    be my great regret      be the one girl
.Am   Am7  D          Dsus4
 That I'll   never forget
.Am                    Am7          D      G     G
   Be my undoing be my slow road to ruin tonight.

.G                       C           C9       C         G
   So the bus is pulling out and I'm grounded here with you
.      Am      Am7     C                      C9     C      D
 And I want to say the sweet things babe I've always wanted to
.   C              G                       D      C
 So tell me now the  tail-lights have gone out of sight
.C                     D                      G
   Baby want you be my  downfall once again tonight.</lyrics>

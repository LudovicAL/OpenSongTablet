.    F
 And now, the end is near
.         Cm6             D7
 And so I face the final curtain.
.    Gm                   Gm7
 My friend, I'll say it clear
.              C7                 F
 I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
.                          F7
 I've lived a life that's full
.            Bb              Bbm
 I travelled each and every highway
.     F                     C7
 And more, much more than this,
.         Gm  F
 I did it my way.

 Regrets, I've had a few
 But then again too few to mention.
 I did what I had to do
 And saw it through, without exemption.
 I planned each charted course
 Each careful step, along the byway
 And more, much more than this,
 I did it my way.

.                                    Cm7
 Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew,
.           Bb
 When I bit off more than I could chew
.               Gm7                 C7
 But through it all, when there was doubt
.         Am7              Dm
 I ate it up, and spit it out,
.           Gm7               C7
 I faced it all, And I stood tall,
.           Gm F
 And did it my way.

 I've loved, I've laughed and cried
 I've had my fill, my share of losing.
 And now, as tears subside,
 I find it all so amusing.
 To think, I did all that,
 And may I say, "not in a shy way",
 Oh no, oh no not me,
 I did it my way.

 For what is a man, what has he got,
 If not himself, then he has not,
 To say the things, he truly feels,
 And not the words of one who kneels.
 The record shows, I took the blows,
 And did my way.</lyrics>

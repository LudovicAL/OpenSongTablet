;Passing Through (written by R. Blakeslee - ar. L. Cohen)

.      C                       F
 I saw Jesus on the cross on a hill called Calvary
.        C                                 G
 "Do you hate mankind for what they done to you?"
.         C                                F
 He said, "Talk of love not hate, things to do - it's getting late.
.        C                   G             C
 I've so little time and I'm only passing through."

[C
.C
 Passing through, passing through.
.                           C7
 Sometimes happy, sometimes blue,
.          F
 glad that I ran into you.
.         C               G               C
 Tell the people that you saw me passing through.
[

.      C                             F
 I saw Adam leave the Garden with an apple in his hand,
.       C                                      G
 I said "Now you're out, what are you going to do?"
.            C                              F
 "Plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little cane.
.        C                  G             C
 I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through."

;Chorus

.           C                          F
 I was with Washington at Valley Ford, shivering in the snow.
.         C                                      G
 I said, "How come the men here suffer like they do?"
.          C                            F
 "Men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right
.      C                       G             C
 even though they know they're only passing through"

;Chorus

.           C                                F
 I was with Franklin Roosevelt's side on the night before he died.
.         C                                    G
 He said, "One world must come out of World War Two" (ah, the fool)
.         C                                   F
 "Yankee, Russian, white or tan," he said, "A man is still a man.
.          C                      G             C
 We're all on one road, and we're only passing through."

.Am                                        G
 You must leave now take what you need you think will last
.Am                                       G
 But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast
.Am                                 G
 Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
.Am                        G
 Crying like a fire in the sun.
.Em                             D
 Look out the Saints are comin' through
.Am                D         G
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

 The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
 Take what you have gathered from coincidence
 The empty handed painter from your streets
 Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
 This sky too, is folding under you
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

 All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
 All your reindeer armies, are all going home
 The lover who just walked out your door
 Has taken all his blankets from the floor
 The carpet too, is moving under you
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

 Leave your stepping stone behind, something calls for you
 Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
 The vagabond who's rapping at your door
 Is standing in the clothes that you one wore
 Strike another match, go start anew
 And it's all over now, Baby Blue.</lyrics>

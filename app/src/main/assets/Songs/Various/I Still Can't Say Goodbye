 When I was young, my Dad would say Come on Son let's go out and play
.G            D          C     Dsus4 D   Em D/F# G C D
 Sometimes it seems like yesterday                   

.G             D      C      D     G    D         Bm    C
 And I'd climb up the closet shelf When I was all by my-self
.G            D       C     Dsus4 D Em         D/F#     G
 Grab his hat and fix the brim      Pretending I    was him

.D             C      G
 No matter how hard I try
.D                  C       G
 No matter how many tears I cry
.D                  Em    D  Em/C#
 No matter how many years go by
.  C           D        C Em D/F# G Em D/F#
 I still can't say good-bye            

.G              D       C       D   G        D          Bm        C
 He always took care of Mom and me.   We all cut down a Christmas tree
.G          D        C        Dsus4 D Em D/F# G
  He always had some time for me              

.C      D                 Em    Em/D
   Wind blows through the trees 
.C                   D           Gmaj7
 Street lights, they still shine bright
.C      D              Em   Em/D
   Most things are the same 
.      Em/C#          C      Dsus4 D
 but I miss my Dad to-night        

.G              D       C       D   G        D          Bm        C
 I walked by a Salvation Army store Saw a hat like my daddy wore  
.G          D        C     Dsus4 D Em                  D/F#    G
 Tried it on when I walked in          Still trying to be like him

.D             C      G
 No matter how hard I try
.D                  C       G
 No matter how many years go by
.D                  Em    D  Em/C#
 No matter how many tears I cry
.  C           D        C Em D/F# G Em D/F# G
 I still can't say good-bye</lyrics>

.Am                               G
 Dear wind that shakes the barley free,
.Am                               G   G/F#     Em
 Blow home my true love's ship to me, fill her sails.
.Am                      G
 I a-weary wait upon the shore.

.Am                          G
 Forsake her not in times of storm,
.Am                           G     G/F#     Em
 protect her oaken beams from harm, fill her sails.
.Am                      G
 I a-weary wait upon the shore.

.Am                   G
 Whether he be in Africa
.Am                    G  G/F#     Em
 Or deep asleep in India, fill his dreams,
.Am                      G
 I a-weary wait upon the shore.

.Am                             G
 Dear snow white gulls upon the wing,
.Am                     G    G/F#   Em
 I, like you, are lamenting, for my love.
.Am                      G
 I a-weary wait upon the shore.

.Am                   G
 And in my chariot of sleep,
.Am                         G     G/F# Em
 I ride the vast and dreamy deep, deep sea.
.Am                     G
 I awake a-weary on the shore.

.Am                         G
 For seven years and seven days,
.Am                         G     G/F# Em
 no man has seen my woman's ways, dear God.
.Am                         G
 I a-weary cry upon the shore.

.Am                        G
 Along the shingle beach I go,
.Am                     G   G/F# Em
 the wind about me as I make my way,
.Am                        G
 to my weary dream upon my bed.

.Am                               G
 Dear wind that shakes the barley free,
.Am                               G   G/F#     Em
 Blow home my true love's ship to me, fill her sails.
.Am                      G
 I a-weary wait upon the shore.
.Am                      G
 I a-weary wait upon the shore.</lyrics>

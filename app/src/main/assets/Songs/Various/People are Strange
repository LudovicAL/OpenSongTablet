.Em                   Am         Em        Am         Em    B        Em
 People are strange  When your a Stranger  Faces look ugly when your alone
 Women Seem Wicked   When your unwanted    Streets are uneven when you are down

.Em                   G                          B                  B
 When Your strange    Faces come out in the rain    When Your strange
.G                          B
 Nobody remembers your name   When your strange When your strange
 When your strange........

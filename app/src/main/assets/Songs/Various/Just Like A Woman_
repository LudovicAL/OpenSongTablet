.  F    Bb    C7    F
 Nobody feels any pain
.              Bb   C7            F
 Tonight as I stand inside the rain
.Bb         C7
 Everybody knows
.B7                   C7
 That Baby's got new clothes
.      Bb Am     Gm   F      C7
 But late-ly     I   see her ribbons and her bows
.      Dm      F  Bb   C11     C7    C9    C7
 Have fallen from her curls                

;Chorus:
.C7    F    Am   Gm  F Bb
 She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
.      F         Am   Gm  F Bb
 She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
.          F    Am   Gm  F B
 And she aches just like a woman
.        C11    C7          C9     C7  F
 But she breaks just like a little     girl.

;Verse 2
 Queen Mary, she's my friend.
 Yes I believe I'll go see her again.
 Noboby has to guess,
 That baby can't be blessed,
 'Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest.
 With her fog,
 Her amphetamines
 And her pearls

;Chorus

;Bridge :
.       A7
 It was raining from the first
 And I was dying of thirst
.     F
 So I came in here
.        A7
 And you long time curse hurts
.                        Bb
 But whats worse is this pain in here
.C11      C7         C9 C6
  I can't stay in here
.C11      C7   C9 C7
 Ain't it   clear that

;Verse 3
 I just can't fit.
 Yes I believe it's time for us to quit.
 And when we meet again,
 Introduced as friends,
 Please don't let on that you knew me when,
 I was hungry,
 And it was your world then.

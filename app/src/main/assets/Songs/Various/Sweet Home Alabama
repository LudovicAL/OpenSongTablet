.D       C             G
    Big wheels keep on turning
.D           C              G
    Carry me home to see my kin.
.D          C               G
    Singing songs about the southland
.D               C              G
    I miss'ole' 'bamy once again (and I think it's a sin)

 Well, I heard Mister Young sing about her
 Well, I heard ole Neil put her down.
 Well, I hope Neil Young will remember,
 A southern man don't need him around anyhow

[C
 Sweet home Alabama,
 Where the skies are so blue,
 Sweet home Alabama,
 Lord, I'm coming home to you.

.                                       F    C    D
 In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor   Boo  hoo  hoo !
 Now we all did what we could do.
 Now Watergate does not bother me.
 Does your conscience bother you?  (tell the truth)

;CHORUS

 Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
 And they've been known to pick a tune or two
 Lord they get me off so much
 They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
 Now how about you?

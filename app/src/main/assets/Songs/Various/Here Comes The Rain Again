.Am                         F
 Here comes the rain again, falling on my head like a memory
.G                                     Am
 Falling on my head like a new emotion 

.Am                               F
 I want to walk in the open wind, I want to talk like lovers do
.G                                   Am
 Want to dive into your ocean, is it raining with you?

[C]
.         F                C
 So baby, talk to me, like lovers do
.F                  C
 walk with me, like lovers do
.F                C         DG
 Talk to me, like lovers do

.Am                         F
 Here comes the rain again, raining on my head like a tragedy
.G                                   Am
 Tearing me apart like a new emotion 

.Am                                  F
 I want to breathe in the open wind, I want to kiss like lovers do
.G                                   Am
 Want to dive into your ocean, is it raining with you?

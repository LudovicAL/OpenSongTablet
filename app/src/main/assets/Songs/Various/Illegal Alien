;intro (which is like the chorus)
 Bb  Eb | Bb  Eb F|   x4
.G          D           Bb          F
 Got out of bed, wasn't feeling too good
.                      C           Cm          Bb
 With my wallet and my passport, a new pair of shoes
.G           D            Bb          F
 The sun is shining so I head for the park
.                     C        Cm           Bb
 With a bottle of Tequila and a new pack of cigarrettes

 I got a cousin, and she got a friend
 Who thought that her aunt knew a man who could help
 At his apartment, I knock on the door
 He wouldn't come out until he got paid

;Pre-chorus
.    Bb    Eb       Bb    Eb   Bb    Eb
 Now don't tell anybody what I wanna do
.    Bb    Eb   Bb  Eb                   Eb            Bb      Eb
 If they find out, you know that they'll never let me through  

;Chorus (x2)
.Bb      Eb    Bb Eb   F  Bb     Eb   Bb  Eb  F
 Cos it's no fun being an illegal alien       

 Down at the office had to fill out the forms
 A pink one, a red one, the colours you choose
 Up to the counter to see what they think, they said,
 "It doesn't count, man, it aint written in ink"

 I don't trust anybody, least not around here, 'cos
;Chorus (x4)

;solo
 Bb |  |Ab |  |
 An illegal alien, OK
 G(no 3rd) |  |G(no 3)/C |  |G(no 3)/Eb |G(no 3)/D  G(no 3)/F |
 G(no 3rd) |  |G(no 3)/C |  |G(no 3)/Eb |G(no 3)/D  G(no 3)/F |

.D             G
 Consideration for your fellow man
.          C             D7sus4
 Would not hurt anybody, sure fits in with my plan
 Over the border there lies the promised land
 Where everything comes easy, you just hold out your hand

;Pre-chorus
;Chorus (x4)

 {cb:there's a bit where the chords are Bm | Em  |D  |A  |  x2}</lyrics>

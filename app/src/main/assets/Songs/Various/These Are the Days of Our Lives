;Verse 1:
.C                          F/C                C    F        Bb/F F
 Sometimes I get to feeling I was back in the old days long ago
.C                                     F/C      C    F       Bb/F  F
 When we were kids, when we were young things seemed so perfect, you know
.C/G
 The days were nedless, we were crazy we were young
.G
 The sun was always shining, we just lived for fun
.Dm/A                    Dm
 Sometimes I feel like lately, I dont know
.Am                                   G
 The rest of my lifes been just a show

;Chorus:
.C     F/C  C   G/B  Am  G    F9
 Those were the days of our lives
.C        F/C   C   G/B   C   G   F9
 The bad things in life were so few
.        C   F/C  C   G/B  Am  G Bb  Fsus2  Bb   F/A
 Those days are all gone now, but     one thing is true
.         C/G         G          F
 When I look, and I find I still love you

;Verse 2:
 You cant turn back the clock, you cant turn back the tide
 Aint that a shame?
 Id like to go back one time on a rollercoaster ride
 When life's just a game
 No use in sitting and thinking on what you did
 When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
 Sometimes it seems like lately, I just dont know
 Better sit back and go with the flow</lyrics>

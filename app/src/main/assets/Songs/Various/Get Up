.A                 D
 Sleep delays my life
.                      A
 Where does the time go...go
.          D
 I don't know
.                      A
 Sleep sleep sleepy head
.         D
 Wake it up...up
.                      A
 You've got all your life
.          D
 Way up ahead

. E      B     C    G        A
 Dreams they complicate my life
. E      B     C    G        Bb
 Dreams they compliment my life

 I've seen you laying pined
 I've seen you laying pined
 Life is rough...rough
 I've seen you laying down...down
 With the loving kind
 I know life is hard...hard
 Well now
 Where to turn?

 This time there's no escape to dreamtime</lyrics>

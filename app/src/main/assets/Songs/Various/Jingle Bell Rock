;Verse1
. D           Dmaj7        D6          Dmaj7
 Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
.D6           Dmaj7     Em            A
 Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
.Em          A          Em         A
 Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
.E                  A+5
 Now the jingle hop has begun
. D           Dmaj7        D6          Dmaj7
 Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
.D6           Dmaj7     Em          A
 Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
.Em          A             Em         A
 Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
.E       A      D D7
 In the frosty air

;Bridge
.       G                     Gm
 What a bright time, it's the right time
.   D
 To rock the night away
.       E
 Jingle bell time is a swell time
.A
    To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
.D        Dmaj7          D6          Dmaj7
 Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
.D6       Dmaj7     B
 Jingle around the clock
.G                        Gm
 Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
.E             A           D
   That's the jingle bell rock

;Verse2
 Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock        (repeat verse1's
 Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time             last 4 lines)
 Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
 In the frosty air

;Bridge
 What a bright time, it's the right time
 To rock the night away
 Jingle bell time is a swell time
 To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
 Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
 Jingle around the clock
.G                        Gm
 Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
.E           A
 That's the jingle bell
.E           A
 That's the jingle bell
.E           A           D
 That's the jingle bell rock(may try to post guitar lick here too)</lyrics>

.C   G             D               A                 E  E7
 Hey Joe where ya' goin' with that gun in your hand?    
.       C   G   D        A               E                 E7
 I said hey Joe where ya goin' with that gun in your hand? 
.C                G                 D          A                       E         E7
 I'm goin' out to find my woman now she's been runnin' round with some other man 
.C                       G                 D          A                        E         E7
 I said I'm goin' out to find my woman now she's been runnin' 'round with some other man 

 Hey Joe tell me what are you gonna do?
 Hey Joe tell me what are you gonna do?
 Well I guess I'll shoot my woman that's what I'll do
 Well I guess I'll shoot them both before I'm through

 Hey Joe tell me where are you gonna go?
 Hey Joe tell me where are you gonna go?
 Well I think I'll go down to my favourite place Mexico
 Well I think I'll go down to where a man can be free
 And there ain't gonna be no hangmans ropes gonna be put around me</lyrics>

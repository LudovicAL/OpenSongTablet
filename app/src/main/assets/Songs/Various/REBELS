[Intro C G    Am F

.C                        Am
 Honey don't walk out I`m too drunk to follow
.C                            Am
 You know you won't feel this way tomorrow
.        F                   G
 Well - maybe I'm a little rough around the edges
.F               G
 Inside a little hollow
.F                G
 I get faced with somethings sometimes
.F         G                   Am
 That are so hard to swallow - Hey !

;Chorus
[C
.             C
 I was born a rebel
.        Am                C
 Down in Dixie on a Sunday morning
.            F               G
 Yeah - with one foot in the grave
.    F               G
 And one foot on the pedal
.             Am
 I was born a rebel.
[

 Well she picked me up in the morning
 And she payed out my ticket
 Yeah she screamed in the car
 And threw me out in the thicket
 Well - I never would've dreamed
 That her heart was so wicked
 Oh - but I keep coming back
 'Cos it's so hard to kick it.

;Chorus

 Even before my father's fathers
 They called us all rebels
 Burned our cornfields
 And left our cities level
 I can still see the eyes
 Of those blue bellied devils
 When I'm walking round tonight
 Through the concrete and metal.</lyrics>

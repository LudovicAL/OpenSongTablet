.Am

.G                                  D
 Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing
.                          G                         D
 I'm very scared for this world, I'm very scared for me
.                   G            G
 Eviscerate your memory Here's a scene
.       D
 You're in the back seat laying down
.    G                            D
 The windows wrap around you, The sound of the travel and the engine
.C               G                  C
 All you hear is time stand still in travel
.                          G
 You feel such peace and absolue
.                           C
 The stillness still that doesn't end
.                   G
 But slowly drifts into sleep
.      D
 The stars are the greatest thing you've ever seen
.     D
 And they're there for you
.     D                            G
 For you alone you are the everything
.     G                 D
 I think about this world a lot and I cry
.      G                         D
 And I've seen the films and the eyes
.                  G                     D
 But I'm in this kitchen everything is beautiful
.                G                            D
 And she is so beautiful, she is so young and old
.                  C                        G
 I look at her and I see the beauty of the light of music
.      C                                 G
 The voice is talking somewhere in the house
.                          C
 Late spring and you're drifting off to sleep
.            D
 With your teeth in your mouth
.D
 You are here with me
.D
 You are here with me
.D                                 Am
 You have been here and you are everything</lyrics>

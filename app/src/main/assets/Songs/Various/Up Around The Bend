;Intro
.D   D     A    D
                

.D                                              A                   D
 There's a place up ahead and I'm going just as fast as my feet can fly
.D                                  A                        D
 Come away come away if your going, leave the sinking ship behind

;Chorus
.G           G/F#   A           G         G/F#      A
 Come on the rising wind that's going up around the bend

.D                                             A                      D
 Bring a song and a smile for the banjo better get while the gettings good
.         D                                        A             D
 Get your ride to the end of the highway where the neons turn to wood

;Chorus

.D                                        A                 D
 You can ponder perpetual motion fix your mind on a crystal day
.D                                            A                  D
 Always time for good conversation there's an earful of what you say

;Chorus
;Intro
;Solo

.D                                                 A                   D
 Get your ride to the end of the highway and we'll meet by the big red tree
.D                                             A                    D
 There's a place up ahead and I'm going, come along come along with me

;Chorus

               It was Christmas Eve babe In the drunk tank
.           D                       G/A       A            D
 An old man said to me, won't see another one  And then he sang a song
.             G                            D
 The Rare Old Mountain Dew And I turned my face away
.    G        Asus4/E D  G/A
 And dreamed about    you

.G/A            D                      G
       Got on a lucky one Came in eighteen to one
.           D                       G/A       A
 I've got a feeling This year's for me and you
.         D                    G
 So happy Christmas I love you baby
.            D                G        Asus4/E    D
 I can see a better time When all our dreams come true

               /faster now/          

.            D
 They've got cars
.       A
 Big as bars
.            Bm        G
 They've got rivers of gold
.        D
 But the wind goes right through you
.                      A
 It's no place for the old
.         D             Bm
 When you first took my hand
.     D              G
 On a cold Christmas Eve
.    D
 You promised me
.             A           D
 Broadway was waiting for me
.         D
 You were handsome

 You were pretty
.                  A
 Queen of New York City
.         D             G
 When the band finished playing
.     A              D
 They howled out for more
.D
 Sinatra was swinging
.                         A
 All the drunks they were singing
.   D             G
 We kissed on the corner
.     A                  D
 Then danced through the night
.    G             Bm A
 The boys of the NYPD choir
.     D               Bm
 Were singing 'Galway Bay'
.        D          G
 And the bells were ringing
.A                 D A Bm G  D A  D Bm D G   D A D
 Out for Christmas day                           

.D
 You're a bum
.         D
 You're a punk
.                      A
 You're an old slut on junk
.       D            G         A
 Living there almost dead on a drip
.        D
 In that bed
.    D
 You scum bag

 You maggot
.                A
 You cheap lousy faggot
.      D              G
 Happy Christmas your arse
.       A
 I pray God
.         D   A D
 It's our last

.A            D
 I could have been someone
.         G
 So could anyone
.            D
 You took my dreams
.                     A
 From me when I first found you
.            D
 I kept them with me babe
.           G
 I put them with my own
.              D
 Can't make it all alone
.              G      A      D
 I've built my dreams around you

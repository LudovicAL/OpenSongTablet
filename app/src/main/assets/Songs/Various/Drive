.   A                 Amaj7     A   Amaj7
 Who's gonna tell you when it's too late
.   A                 Amaj7         A  Amaj7
 Who's gonna tell you things aren't so great

[C]
.  F#m        Bm           F#m           Bm
 You can't go on , thinkin' nothing's wrong
.   A                  Amaj7       A
 Who's gonna drive you home tonight
[]

.   A                 Amaj7   A    Amaj7
 Who's gonna pick you up when you fall
.   A                Amaj7   A    Amaj7
 Who's gonna hang it up when you call
.   A              Amaj7      A    Amaj7
 Who's gonna pay attention to your dreams
.   A                      Amaj7     A    Amaj7
 And who's gonna plug your ears when you scream

;chorus

.   A                 Amaj7     A    Amaj7
 Who's gonna hold you down when you push
.   A              Amaj7      A    Amaj7
 Who's gonna come around when you break

.       Em                                    G
 As you brush your shoes and stand before the mirror
.Em                                            G
 And you comb your hair and grab your coat and go out
.        Em                               G        Em
 And you walk the wet streets tryin' to remember   
.        C                  D              G
 All the wild night breezes in your memory ever

;Chorus
.         Em                 C    F/C
 And everything looks so complete 
.            Em                 C      F/C
 When you're walkin' out on the street 
.        Em                   C
 And the wind will catch your feet
.    F/C      D
 And send you flyin' crying

.Em   C  D   Em         D        G
 Ooh     wee   the wild night is callin'
.Em   C  D   Em         D        G
 Ooh     wee   the wild night is callin'

.            Em                                G
 And all the girls walk by dressed up for each other
.Em                                                     G
 And the boys do the boogie woogie on the corner of the street
.        Em                                   G       Em
 And the people passin' by just stare in wild wonder  
.        C               D                   G
 And the inside juke box roars out just like thunder

;Chorus

.    Em
 The wild night is callin'
.Em                G
 The wild night is callin'
.G               Em                      G       Em
 Come on out and dance come out and make romance 
.Em              C     D                      G
 Come on out and dance come on out and make romance

.Gm7         Am7       Gm7         Am7      Gm7
 Well it's a marvelous night for a moondance
.Gm7      Am7       Gm7          Am7 Gm7
 With the stars up above in your eyes
.Gm7  Am7        Gm7           Am7    Gm7
 A fantababulous night to make romance
.Gm7         Am7      Gm7     Am7  Gm7
 B'neath the cover of October skies

.Gm7     Am7           Gm7       Am7    Gm7
 All the leaves of the trees are falling
.Gm7    Am7          Gm7          Am7 Gm7
 To the sound of the breezes that blow
.Gm7          Am7       Gm7          Am7    Gm7
 Y'a know I'm tryin' to plead to the calling
.Gm7     Am7                Gm7           Am7
 Of your heart strings that play soft and low

.Gm7          Cm7     Gm7   Cm7                  Gm7
 You know the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
.Gm7          Cm7  Gm7                Cm7        D
 You know the soft moonlight seems to shine your blush

.D   Gm7    Cm7      Gm7      Cm7        Gm7 Cm7 Gm7 Cm7
 Can I just have one more moondance with you    my love
.D   Gm7    Cm7       Gm7    Cm7        Gm7 Cm7 Gm7 Cm7
 Can I just make some more romance with you    my love

.Gm7         Am7       Gm7         Am7Gm7
 Well I wanna make love to you tonight
.Gm7         Am7       Gm7         Am7Gm7
 I can't wait till the moment has come
.Gm7         Am7       Gm7         Am7   Gm7
 Yea'n I know that the time is just right
.Gm7         Am7       Gm7         Am7 Gm7
 And straight into my arms you will run

.Gm7         Am7       Gm7         Am7 Gm7
 When you come my heart will be waiting
.Gm7         Am7       Gm7         Am7 Gm7
 To make sure that you're never alone
.Gm7         Am7       Gm7         Am7       Gm7
 There and then all my dreams will come true dear
.Gm7         Am7       Gm7         Am7Gm7
 There and then I will make you my own

.Gm7          Cm7     Gm7   Cm7                 Gm7
 Every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
.Gm7          Cm7     Gm7   Cm7                  Gm7
 Then I know how much you want me that you can't hide
.Gm7          Cm7     Gm7   Cm7                  Gm7
 Can I just have one more moondance with you my love
.Gm7          Cm7     Gm7   Cm7                  Gm7
 Can I just make some more romance with you my love

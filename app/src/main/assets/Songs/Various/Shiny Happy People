.E       B     A     B
 Shiny happy people laughing
.F#m           F#m7    A       E
 Meet me in the crowd, people, people
.F#m           F#m7       A       E
 Throw your love around, love me, love me
.F#m                 A       E
 Take it into town, happy, happy
.F#m                    A               E
 Put it in the ground where the flowers grow
.B                E
 Gold and silver shine
 Shiny happy people holding hands
 Shiny happy people holding hands
 Shiny happy people laughing

 Everyone around, love them, love them
 Put it in your hands, take it, take it
 There's no time to cry, happy, happy
 Put it in your heart where tomorrow shines
 Gold and silver shine
 Shiny happy people holding hands
 Shiny happy people holding hands
 Shiny happy people laughing
 (Here we go)
 Shiny happy people holding hands
 Shiny happy people holding hands
 Shiny happy people laughing
 Shiny happy people holding hands
 Shiny happy people holding hands
 Shiny happy people laughing
 People, happy people
 People, happy people</lyrics>

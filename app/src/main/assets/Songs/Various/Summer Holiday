.E         C#m        F#m        B9
 We're all going on a summer holiday
.E       C#m           F#m     B7
 no more working for a week or two.
.E       C#m             F#m      B7
 fun and laughter on our summer holiday,
.F#m7            B7  E     Em
 no more worries for me or you,
.F#m7       B7 E
 for a week or two.

.F#m7                  B7         E
 we're going where the sun shines brightly
.F#m7                  B7     E
 we're going where the sea is blue.
.G#m
 we've all seen it on the movies,
.    F#7               B7
 now let's see if it's true.

 Everybody has a summer holiday
 doin' things they always wanted to
 so we're going on a summer holiday,
 to make our dreams come true
 for me and you.
 for me and you.</lyrics>

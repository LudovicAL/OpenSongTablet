;
;This is my version of Big Sur from the Thrills album "So much for the city"
;
;I've stolen a couple of bits from the previous version and obviously added
;in a few guitar bits too. The picking pattern from the intro is pretty much
;maintained during most of the verses but usually with an open top string, play
;around and see what you like the sound of. I don't think the opening Dsus2 is
;strictly right but its the best I could figure out in the 15 mins I've spent on
;this.
;
;I hope you enjoy this, its my first posting so any comments please send to
;ian_22_edinburgh@yahoo.no.spam.com. Obviously miss out the no spam part, thats
;just to cut down on junk mail.

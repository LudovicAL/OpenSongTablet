.D                F#7     B7
 Once I lived the of a millionaire
.G           B7          Em
 Spending my money and I didn't care
.G                 C#7       D           B7
 Taking my friends out for a mighty fine time
.         E7                     A7
 Drinking high priced liquor champagne and wine
.D            F#7     B7
 When I began to fall so low
.  G             B7         Em
 I didn't hava a friend and no place to go
.     G           C#7        D        B7
 If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
.          E7                      A7
 I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

.D F#7  B7        G    B7        Em
 Nobody knows you when your down and out
.G       C#7    D       B7
 In your pocket not one penny
.E7                      A7
 and as for friends, you haven't any
.       D               F#7     B7
 But as soon as you get on your feet again
.G         B7               Em
 Everybody wants to be your long lost friend
.     G              C#7  D     B7
 It's mighty strange  without a doubt
.E7                         A7           D
 Nobody knows you when your down and out 

.D F#7  B7        G    B7        Em
 Nobody knows you when your down and out
.G       C#7    D       B7
 In your pocket not one penny
.E7                      A7
 and as for friends, you haven't any
.       D               F#7     B7
 But as soon as you get on your feet again
.G         B7               Em
 Everybody wants to be your long lost friend
.     G              C#7  D     B7
 It's mighty strange  without a doubt
.E7                         A7       D
 Nobody knows you when your down and out
.D7     B7 E7      A7           D
 I mean  when your down and out</lyrics>

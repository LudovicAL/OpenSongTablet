;4 Non Blondes

 (Verse 1)
.A
      25 years of my life and still
.Bmin
   Tryin' to to get up that great big hill of
.D                                    A
      Hope, for a destination.        
.A
      I realized quickly when I knew I should
.Bmin
   That the world was made up of this brotherhood of
.D                                    A
      Man, for whatever that means.   

;Chorus
 And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed
 just to get all out, what's in my head, then
 I, I am feeling, a little peculiar.
 And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside
 And I take a deep breath, and I get real high, and
 I, scream from the top of my lungs, "What's going on?"
 And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
 I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
 And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
 I said, "Hey, what's going on?"

 (Verse 2)
.A
      And I try, oh my god, do I try
.Bmin            D                           A
   I try all the  time, in this institution. 
.A
      And I pray, oh my god, do I pray
.Bmin                  D                       A
   I pray every single  day, for a revolution. 

 (Chorus and last four lines of the chorus are repeated 2x more)

 (Verse 3)
 25 years of my life and still
 Tryin' to get up that great big hill of
 Hope, for a destination</lyrics>

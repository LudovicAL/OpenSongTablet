.A                         D       C                      D
 Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC, didn't get to bed last night
.   A                       D               C                   D
 On the way a paperback was on my knee, man I had a dreadful flight

;Chorus
.D                  A  C                               D
 I'm back in the USSR  you don't know how lucky you are, boy
.D                 A          D   Eb   E
  Back in the USSR                     

.A                          D               C                        D
 Been away so long I hardly knew the place, gee it's good to be back home
.A                           D             C                    D
 Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case, honey disconnect the phone

;Chorus
.D/E             G/E
 Back in the US, back in the US, back in the USSR

;Bridge
.A                        D                       A
 Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out, they leave the west behind
.    D      F#m/C#        Am/C           B7
 And Moscow girls make me sing and shout 
.     E7                           D7                     A
 That Georgia's always on my-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind 

.A                                        D               C                       D
 Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south, take me to your daddy's farm
.A                          D            C                          D
 Let me hear you balalaikas ringing out, come and keep your comrade warm

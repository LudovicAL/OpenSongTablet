.     Dsus       G  A  Bm
 You fill up my senses 
.        G          D
 Like a night in a forest
.                         G   F#m Em
 like the mountains in springtime 
.        G           A7
 Like a walk in the rain
.                     G A   Bm
 Like a storm in the desert 
.         G         D
 Like a sleepy blue ocean
.                G  F#mEm
 You fill up my senses 
.      A7       D   Dsus D
 Come fill me again  

.             G    A  Bm
 Come let me love you 
.        G            D
 let me give my life to you
.                      G    F#mEm
 Let me drown in your laughter 
.        G          A7
 Let me die in your arms
.                   G    A  Bm
 Let me lay down beside you 
.       G          D
 Let me always be with you
.             G    F#mEm
 Come let me love you 
.      A7       D   Dsus D
 Come love me again  

.                G  A  Bm
 You fill up my senses 
.        G          D
 Like a night in a forest
.                         G   F#m Em
 like the mountains in springtime 
.        G           A7
 Like a walk in the rain
.                     G A   Bm
 like a storm in the desert 
.         G         D
 like a sleepy blue ocean
.                G  F#mEm
 you fill up my senses 
.      A7       D   Dsus D
 come fill me again</lyrics>

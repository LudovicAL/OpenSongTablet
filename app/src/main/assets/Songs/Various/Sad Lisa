.    Em                             D    C
 She hangs her head and cries in my shirt
.    D       Em        D    G
 She must be hurt very badly.
.        G      D          E    A
 Tell me what's making you sadly.
.E         A           D           C
 Open your door, don't hide in the dark.
.       D           Em            D     G
 You're lost in the dark, you can trust me
.          D                  Em   A
 Cause you know that's how it must be
.Em   A        B    Em
 Lisa Lisa sad Lisa Lisa

.    Em                            D   C
 Her eyes like windows trickelling rain,
. D       Em           D  G
 Upon her pain getting deeper.
.          G    D        Em      A
 Though my love wants to relieve her
.    Em     A         D       C
 She walks alone from wall to wall
.D           Em             D    G
 Lost in her hall she can't hear me
.         G        D            E    A
 Though I know she likes to be mnear me
.Em   A        B    Em
 Lisa Lisa sad Lisa Lisa

.    Em                      D   C
 She sits in a corner by the door
.      D       Em         D    G
 There must be more I can tell her
.       G      D           Em   A
 If she really wants me to help her
.     Em        A      D            D
 I'll do what I can to show her the way
.    D          Em         D    G
 And maybe some day I will free her
.         D               Em  A
 Though I know no one can see her
.Em   A        B    Em

;Intro
.G         D/F#            C/E             D
                                           

.G                D/F#    C/E                   D
 It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to
 wear.
.G               D/F#    C/E              D
 She puts on her make-up, and brushes her long blonde hair.
.C            D       G     D/F#     Em
 And then she asks me, do I look all right,
.          C             D7          G
 And I say yes, you look wonderful tonight

;repeat Into

 We go to a party and everyone turns to see
 This beautiful lady that's walking along with me
 And then she asked me "Do you feel alright?"
 And I said "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

[C
.    Am    Bm   C            D7              G
 And I     feel wonderful, because I see the love-light
.D/F#    Em
 in your eyes
.         C            D7              C             D7
 then the wonder of it all is that you just don't realise how much
.  G
 I love you.

;repeat Intro

 It's time to go home now, but I've got an aching head
 So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
 And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
 I say "Darling, you are wonderful tonight"
 Oh my darling, you are wonderful tonight
.              C                  D          Gsus G
 I'll say, "My darlin', you were wonderful tonight"</lyrics>

. D
 Tell her I'll be waiting
. Bm
 In the usual place
. G
 With the tired and weary
. A
 And there's no escape

 To need a woman
 You've got to know
 How the strong get weak
 And the rich get poor

 You're running with me
 Don't touch the ground
 We're the restless hearted
 Not the chained and bound

 The sky is burning
 A sea of flame
 Though your world is changing
 I will be the same

 The storm is breaking
 Or so it seems
 We're too young to reason
 Too grown up to dream

 Now spring is turning
 Your face to mine
 I can hear your laughter
 I can see you smile

 No - I can't escape
 I'm a slave to love</lyrics>

 First thing I remember was asking papa, why,
.     B#               G              B#
 For there were many things I didn't know.
.                  F#         G#m            E
 And daddy always smiled and took me by the hand,
.        B#       F#           B#
 Saying, someday you'll understand.

;Chorus:
.          F#                             B#
 Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
.         F#                          B#
 That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
.       C#m  E         B#
 'Cause someday never comes.

 Well, time and tears went by and I collected dust.
 For there were many things I didn't know.
 When daddy went away, he said, try to be a man,
 And someday you'll understand.

;Chorus

 And then one day in April, I wasn't even there,
 For there were many things I didn't know.
 A son was born to me. Mama held his hand,
 sayin' someday you'll understand.

;Chorus

 Think it was September, the year I went away,
.      C               A6             C
 For there were many things I didn't know.
.      C               G        Am           F
 And still I see him standing tryin' to be a man,
.          C       G           C
 I said, someday you'll understand.

.           G                               C
 Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son,
.          G                          C
 That you better learn it fast, you better learn it young,
.        Dm7 F6         F
 'Cause someday never comes.

;The Mamas and the Papas

;(bass-strum: repeat C - G - C - G- Bb- C throughout)
.  C
 John and Mitchie were gettin' kinda itchie
 just to leave the folk music behind
. F7
 Zal and Denny workin' for a penny
. C
 tryin' to get a fish on the line
.     G7
 In a coffee house Sebastian sat
.     F7
 and after every number they passed the hat
.    C
 McGuinn and McGuire just are gettin' higher
.                              F7
 in L.A. you know where that's at
.                     Eb               C
 And no one's getting fat except Mama Cass.

 Zallie said 'Denny, you know there aren't many
 who can sing a song the way that you do' (Let's go South)
 Denny said 'Zallie, golly, don't you think that I wish
 I could play guitar like you'
 Zal, Denny and Sebastian sat (at the Night Owl)
 And after every number they passed the hat
 McGuinn and McGuire just are gettin' higher
 in L.A. you know where that's at
 And no one's getting fat except Mama Cass.

 When Cass was a Sophomore, planned to go to Swarthmore,
 But she changed her mind one day
 Standign on the turnpike, thumb out to hitchhike,
 Take her to New York right away
 When Denny met Cass he gave her love bumps
 Call John and Zal, and that was the Mugwumps
 McGuinn and McGuire couldn't get no higher
 but that's what they were aiming at
 And no one's getting fat except Mama Cass.

 Mugwumps, hi-jumps, low slumps, big bumps,
 don't you work as hard as you play
 Drink-up, break-up, everything is shake-up
 Guess it had to be that way
 Sebastian and Zal formed the Spoonful
 Michelle, John and Denny gettin' very tuneful
 McGuinn and McGuire just are catchin' fire
 in L.A. you know where that's at
 And everybody's gettin' fast except Mama Cass.

 Broke, busted, disgusted, agents can't be trusted,
 and Mitchie wants to go to the sea
 Cass can't make it, she says we'll have to fake it
 We knew she'd come eventually
 Greasin' on American Express card
 Tents, low rents, and keepin' out the heat's hard
 Duffy's good vibrations, and our imaginations,
 can't go on indefinitely
 And California Dreaming is becoming a reality.</lyrics>

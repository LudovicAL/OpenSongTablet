.G#msus2            E                    F#/A#         B   F#
 
[V1] 
.G#m                     E                                   F#/A#
 I'm not saying its your fault, although you could have done more
.          B            F#
 Oh you're so naive yet so
.G#m                 E                           F#/A#
 How could this been done by such a smiling sweetheart.
.       B                F#
 Oh I'm just a sweet and pretty face
.G#m                       E              F#/A#
 In such an ugly world something so beautiful.
.             B           F#
 Oh that everytime I look inside
 
[C]
.E           B              F#/A#
 I know, she knows that I'm not fond of asking 
.E                     B                       F#/A#
 True or false, it may be... Well, she's still out to get me.
.E               G#m            F#/A#
 And I know, she knows that i'm not fond of asking
.E                     B                        F#/A#        E
 True or false, it may be... She's still out to get me!

[V2]
 I may say it was your fault because I know you could have done more
 Oh you're so naive yet so
 How could this be done by such a smiling sweetheart.
 Oh I'm just a sweet and pretty face
 In such an ugly world, something so beautiful
 That everytime I look inside
 
;Chorus

[Break]

[V3]
 So how could this be done by such a smiling sweetheart
 You're so naive yet so
 You're such an ugly thing for someone so beautiful
 That everytime you're on his side

;Chorus

[Outro]
.E  B/D#  G#m        B          E  B/D#  G#m         B

.E  B/D#  G#m        B          E  B/D#  G#m     B
          Just don't let me down,        Hold on to your kite
.E  B/D#  G#m        B          E  B/D#  G#m        B

.Dm              G                          F
 If you want a lover, I'll do anything you ask me to
.                 G                                 F
 And if you want another kind of love, I'll wear a mask for you
.                Dm
 If you want a partner take my hand
.                    Bb                              C
 Or if you want to strike me down in anger, here I stand
.           Dm
 I'm your man

.                G                          F
 If you want a boxer, I will step into the ring for you
.                   G                          F
 And if you want a doctor, I'll examine every inch of you
.                Dm
 If you want a driver, climb inside
.                   Bb                                C
 Or if you want to take me for a ride, you know you can
.           Dm
 I'm your man

.         F
 Ah, the moon's too bright
.      Bb
 The chain's too tight
.      C                     F
 The beast won't go to sleep 
.     Am
 I've been running through these promises to you
.        Dm
 That I made and I could not keep
.    Am                                    Dm
 But a man never got a woman back, not by begging on his knees
.        Bb
 Or I'd crawl to you baby
.        A
 And I'd fall at your feet
.        Bb                          A
 And I'd howl at your beauty like a dog in heat
.         Bb
 And I'd claw at your heart
.         B                           C
 And I'd tear at your sheet I'd say please, (please)
.           Dm
 I'm your man

.                      G                                   F
 And if you've got to sleep a moment on the road, I will steer for you
.                    G                             F
 And if you want to work the street alone, I'll disappear for you
.             Dm
 If you want a father for your child
.                      Bb                            C
 Or only want to walk with me a while across the sand.
.           Dm
 I'm your man</lyrics>

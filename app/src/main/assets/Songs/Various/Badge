;Intro:
.Am    D    Am    D
                  
.Am                 D                           Em
 Thinkin' 'bout the times your drove in my car  
.Am              D                              Emadd9          Em
 Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far                   
.C                         Am                         Bm    Amadd9
 And I'm thinkin' bout the love that you laid on my table   

.Am                D                         Emadd9          Em
 I told you not to wander 'round in the dark                 
.Am                   D                                 Emadd9        Em
 I told you 'bout the swans, that they live in the park               
.C                         Am                         Bm   Amadd9
 Then I told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to Mable  

;Bridge:
.D    Cmaj7        G/B    G        D    Cmaj7        G/B    G
                                                            
.D      Cmaj7         G/B       G    D                      Cmaj7      G/B       G     D
 Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down, don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round
.        Cmaj7       G/B      G  D                 Cmaj7               G/B     G    D
 And you better pick yourself up from the ground before they bring the curtain down 
.     Cmaj7                 G/B     G    D    C
 Yes, before they bring the curtain down      

;Guitar Solo:
.G/B    G    D    Cmaj7        G/B    G    D    Cmaj7
                                                
.G/B    G    D    Cmaj7        G/B    G    D    Cmaj7
                                                
.G/B    G    D    Cmaj7        G/B    G    D    Cmaj7       D
                                                            
.Am              D                          Emadd9
 Talkin' 'bout a girl that looks quite like you
.Am                  D                         Em
 She didn't have the time to wait in the queue 
.C                  Am                             Bm    Amadd9
 She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle</lyrics>

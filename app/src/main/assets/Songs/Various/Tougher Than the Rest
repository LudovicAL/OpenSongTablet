.                   F
 Well it's Saturday night
.                         C
 You're all dressed up in blue
.                     Bb
 I been watching you awhile
.               F           C
 Maybe you been watching me too
.                F
 So somebody ran out
.                           C
 Left somebody's heart in a mess
.                           Bb
 Well if you're looking for love
.        F         C        F
 Honey I'm tougher than the rest

 Some girls they want a handsome Dan
.                     C
 Or some good-lookin' Joe, on their arm
.     Bb                         F   C
 Some girls like a sweet-talkin' Romeo
.                 F
 Well 'round here baby
.                               C
 I learned you get what you can get
.                              Bb
 So if you're rough enough for love
.        F         C        F
 Honey I'm tougher than the rest

.            dm   Bb
 The road is dark 
.                     F
 And it's a thin thin line
.                  Bb                        C   F
 But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time
.                 dm         Bb
 Maybe your other boyfriends 
.                  F
 Couldn't pass the test
.                                   Bb
 Well if you're rough and ready for love
.        F         C        F
 Honey I'm tougher than the rest

 Well it ain't no secret
.                           C
 I've been around a time or two
.                  Bb                F           C
 Well I don't know baby maybe you've been around too
.                     F
 Well there's another dance
.                        C
 All you gotta do is say yes
.                                  Bb
 And if you're rough and ready for love
.        F         C        F
 Honey I'm tougher than the rest
.                           Bb
 If you're rough enough for love
.       F         C        F
 Baby I'm tougher than the rest

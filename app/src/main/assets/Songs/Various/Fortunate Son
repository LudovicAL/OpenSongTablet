.G                   F
 Some folks are born made to wave the flag
.C                           G
 Ooh, they're red, white and blue
.G                        F
 And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief"
.C                             G
 Ooh, they point the cannon at you y'all

;Chorus
.G            D            C                    G
 It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son y'all
.G            D            C                    G
 It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one no

.G                   F
 Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
.C                         G
 Lord, don't they help themselves  y'all
.G                    F
 But when the tax man comes to the door
.C                             F
 Lord, the house look a like a rummage sale yeah

;Chorus
.G            D            C                        G
 It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son y'all
.G            D            C                    G
 It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one no

.G                  F
 Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
.C                          G
 Ooo, they send you down to war y'all
.G            F
 It ain't me, it ain't me
.C               F
 Im no fortunate one, one

;Chorus
.G            D            C                        G
 It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son y'all
.G            D            C                    G
 It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one no</lyrics>

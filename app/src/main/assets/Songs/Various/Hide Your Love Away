;John Lennon/Paul McCartney
. D       A    C   G   D
 Here I stand head in hand,
. G                   C   G
 Turn my face to the wall.
.D         A      C    G  D
 If she's gone I can't go on,
. G                C    G   A
 Feeling two feet small.    

.  D     A   C  G    D
 Everywhere people stare,
. G              C  G
 Each and every day.
.D      A        C    G  D
 I can see them laugh at me,
. G               C  G   A
 And I hear them say,    

. D                  G              A
 Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
. D                  G              A
 Hey, you've got to hide your love away!

. D      A C  G  D
 How can I even try?
.G            C  G
 I can never win.
. D        A    C   G  D
 Hearing them, seeing them,
. G               C  G   A
 In the state I'm in,    
.D          A   C   G  D    G                C   G
 How could she say to me, "Love will find a way"?
. D       A     C   G     D
 Gather 'round all you clowns,
. G               C  G   A
 Let me hear you say,    

. D                  G              A
 Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
. D                  G              A
 Hey, you've got to hide your love away!

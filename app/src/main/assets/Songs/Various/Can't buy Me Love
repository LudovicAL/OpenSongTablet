.                Em  Am   Em  Am
 Can't buy me love     love   
.                Dm7   G7
 Can't buy me love     
.      C                    C
 I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
 if it makes you feel allright
.        F7
 I'll get you anything my friend
.       C                       C
 if it makes you feel allright  
.    G7               F7
 For I don't care too much for money
.     G7          F7          C
 for money can't buy me love  

.      C                   C
 I'll give you all I've got to give
 if you say you love me too
.     F7
 I may not have a lot to give
.               C                    C
 but what I've got I'll give to you  
.    G7               F7
 For I don't care too much for money
.     G7          F7           C
 for money can't buy me love   

.C               Em   Am
 Can't by me love     
.  F7                     C
 Ev'ry body tells me so   
.                  Em   Am

. Dm7        G7
 No, no, no,  no.

. C                       C
 Say you don't need no diamond ring
 and I'll be satisfied
.      F7
 Tell me that you want those kind of things
.      C
 that money just can't buy
.    G7              F7
 For I don't care too much for money

 for money can't buy me love  
.                 Em   Am     Em    Am
 Can't buy me love,     love        
.                 Dm7     G7    C
 Can't buy me love,  love.</lyrics>

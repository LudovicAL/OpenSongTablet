.D                 Gmaj7      A          F#m
 It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
.Bm             Bm/A          Bm/Ab    G
 I'm not one of those who can easily hide
.D            A           F#       Bm
 I don't much money, but, boy if I did
.D             Em7         G             A
 I'd buy a big house where we both could live

.D          Gmaj7        A       F#m
 If I was a sculptor, but then again no
.Bm           Bm/A               Bm/Ab      G
 Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
.D               A                 F#         Bm
 I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
.D             Em7       G            D
 My gift is my song, and this one for you

[C
.A                Bm        Em7          G
 And you can tell everybody this is your song
.A         Bm           Em                G
 It may be quite simple but now that it's done
.  Bm                     Bm/A
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
.Bm/Ab              G
 That I put down in words,
[
.    D         Em            G             A
 How wonderful life is while you're in the world

.D            Gmaj7    A              F#m
 I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
.Bm                Bm/A   Bm/Ab                G
 Well a few of the verses they've got me quite crossed
.D                        A             F#         Bm
 But the sun's been quite king, while I wrote this song
.D                    Em7           G           A
 It's for people like you that they keep turned on

.D                Gmaj7     A        F#m
 So excuse me and forget but these I do
.Bm              Bm/A              Bm/Ab            G
 You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
.D           A         F#             Bm
 Anyway, the thing is, what I reallly mean
.D             Em7           G         D
 Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
;chorus
.    D         Em            G      A      D

.Dm
 Bet you're wondering how I knew
.             A7               G
 'bout you're plans to make me blue
.                Dm
 with some other guy that you knew before.
.                      A7              G
 Between the two of us guys you know I love you more.
.                 Bm           G
 It took me by surprise I must say,
.       Dm        G
 when I found out yesterday. Oo

[C]
.  Dm
 I heard it through the grapevine
.         G
 not much longer would you be mine.
.     Dm
 Oo I heard it through the grapevine,
.        G                                        Dm
 and I'm just about to lose my mind. Honey, honey yeah.

.Dm
 You know that a man ain't supposed to cry,
.          A7                   G
 but these tears I can't hold inside.
.       Dm
 Losin' you would end my life you see,
.          A7                G
 cause you mean that much to me.
.               Bm          G
 You could have told me yourself
.         Dm    G
 that you found someone else. Instead...

.Dm
 People say believe half of what you see,
.         A7               G
 son, and none of what you hear.
.        Dm
 I can't help bein' confused
.        A7                  G
 if it's true please tell me dear?
.       Bm             G
 Do you plan to let me go
.        Dm             G
 for the other guy that you knew before?</lyrics>

.        E                    A
 All my bags are Packed, I'm ready to go
.      E               A
 I'm standing here outside the door,
.   E               A              H7
 I hate to wake you up to say goodbye.

 But the dawn is breakin', it's early morn,
 The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn.
 Already I'm so lonesome I could die.

[C
.    E            A
 So kiss me and smile for me,
. E                   A
 Tell me that you'll wait for me.
. E                   A(F#m)       H7
 Hold me like you'll never let me go.

 'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane,
 Don't know when I'll be back again.
 Oh babe, I hate to go.
[

 There's so many times I've let you down,
 So many times I've played around,
 I tell you now, they don't mean a thing.
 Ev'ry place I go I'll think of you
 Ev'ry song I sing I'll sing for you.
 When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring.

;Chorus

 Now the time has come to leave you,
 One more time let me kiss you,
 Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
 Dream about the days to come,
 When I won't have to leave alone,
 About the times I won't have to say.

;Chorus</lyrics>

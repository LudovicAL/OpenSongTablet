 For I don't care too much for money, for money can't buy me love.

 I'll give you all I've got to give, if you say you love me too.
 I may not have a lot to give but what I've got I give to you.
 For I don't care too much for money, for money can't buy me love.

[C]
.              G#m   C#m   A7
 Can't buy me love   ,    ev'rybody tells me so.
.E              G#m   C#m   F#m7        B7
  Can't buy me love   ,     no, no, no, no.

 Say you don't need no diamond ring and I'll be satisfied.
 Tell me that you want those kind of things that money just can't buy.
 For I don't care too much for money, for money can't buy me love.

.D  Dmaj9          D          G
    All the people at this party, They've got a lot of style
.D                             C
    They've got stamps of many countries, They've got passport smiles
.         Bm7                                  Em7
 Some are friendly, some are cutting, some are watching it from the wings
.         D/A             A7sus D          A7sus
 Some are standing in the cen-  ter Giving to get something

.Dmaj9                   G                                   D
   Photo Beauty gets attention, Then her eye paint's running down
.D                         C
   She's got a rose in her teeth and a lampshade crown
.Bm7                                  Em7
 One minute she's so happy Then she's crying on someone's knee, saying,
.D/A           A7sus   D              A7sus
 "Laughing and crying, you know, it's the same release."

.  Dmaj9                         G                    D
 I told you when I met you I was crazy. Cry for us all, Beauty
.                     C
 Cry for Eddie in the corner thinking he's nobody
.    Bm7                                   Em7
 And Jack behind his joker, and stone-cold Grace behind her fan, and
.D/A                 A7sus D               A7sus
 Me in my frightened si-   lence, thinking I don't understand

.  Dmaj9              G                 D
 I feel like I'm sleeping, Can you wake me?
.                   C
 You seem to have a broader sensibility
.         Bm7                                  Em7
 I'm just living on nerves and feelings with a weak and a lazy mind
.    D/A                A7sus D/A        A7sus
 And coming to people's par-  ties fumbl-ing deaf dumb and blind

.  Dmaj9                       G
 I wish I had more sense of humor sometimes
.G               F D
   Keeping the sad-ness at bay
.D                      C
 Throwing the lightness on these things
.            Bm7   Em7 D/A A7sus D/A A7sus
 Laughing it all away
.            Bm7   Em7 D/A A7sus D/A A7sus
 Laughing it all away
.            Bm7   Em7 D/A A7sus D/A A7sus
 Laughing it all away
.G           F     D
 Laughing it all a-way</lyrics>

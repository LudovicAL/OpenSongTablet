.E          F#m              G#m     F#m
 Crossroads seem to come and go      
.E                            F#m
 The gypsy flys from coast to coast
.A       Bm          C#m   D
 Knowing many loving none  
.E       F#m           G#m     F#m
 Bearing sorrow having fun     
.Cmaj7                      B             E        F#m     G#m       F#m
 But back home he'll always run, to see Melissa                      

.E              F#m                G#m    F#m
 Freight train, each car looks the same   
.E                        F#m
 No one knows the gypsy's name
.A          Bm               C#m     D
 And no one hears his lonely sigh    
.E            F#m               G#m    F#m
 There are no blankets where he lies   
.Cmaj7                        B                   E         F#m      G#m       F#m
 Beneath his dreams the gypsy flies, with sweet Melissa                        

;Bridge
.E                       F#
 Again the morning comes Again he's on the run
.A                                B
 Sunbeam shining through his hair Care enough to have a care
.C#m                         A        B
 Pick up your gear and gypsy roll on, roll on

.E           F#m                   G#m  F#m
 Crossroads, will you ever let him go   
.E                            F#m
 Will you hide the dead man's ghost
.A       Bm              C#m    D
 Will he lie beneath the clay   
.E        F#m          G#m     F#m
 Will his spirit float away    
.Cmaj7                    B               E      F#m
 But I know that he won't stay, without Melissa  
.Cmaj7                    B               E      F#m
 But I know that he won't stay, without Melissa  
.Cmaj7                    B               E      F#m      G#m      F#m       E
 But I know that he won't stay, without Melissa</lyrics>

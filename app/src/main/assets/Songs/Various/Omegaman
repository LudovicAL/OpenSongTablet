.Bbmaj7                                     Am7
 The night came down, jungle sounds were in my ears
.Bbmaj7                                 Am7
 City screams are all I've heard in tewnty years
.Bbmaj7                                  Am7
 The razor's edge of night, it cuts into my sleep
.Bbmaj7                                Am7
 I sit upon the edge now. Shall I make that leap?

.Am7      F
 I'm the Omegaman
.G        F
 I'm the Omegaman

.Bbmaj7                             Am7
 The sky's alive with turned on television sets
.Bbmaj7                                 Am7
 I walk the streets and seek another vision yet
.Bbmaj7                                  Am7
 The echo makes me turn to see that last frontier
.Bbmaj7                            Am7
 The edge of time closes down as I disappear

[C
.Am7      F
 I'm the Omegaman
.G        F
 I'm the Omegaman
.G        F
 I'm the Omegaman
.G        F
 I'm the Omegaman

.Gm7            Bb
 Always talking to myself   Oh!

.Bbmaj7                                    Am7
 The time that's best is when surroundings fade away
.Bbmaj7                                    Am7
 The presense of another world comes close to me
.Bbmaj7                              Am7
 It's time for me to throw away this paper knife
.Bbmaj7                             Am7
 I'm not alone in reaching for a perfect life

;Chorus

.Bbmaj7 Am7
 I'm so tired...Of the Omegaman</lyrics>

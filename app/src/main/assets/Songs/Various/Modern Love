;Intro, four times

.F                  Am                       G
 Hey I'm feeling so dirty, you're looking so clean
.F                        Am                   G
 All you can give me is a spin in your washing machine
.F                       Dm
 I fly off to Rome to my prima bella
.F                                Dm
 She leaves me in the rain with a telescopic umbrella

[C]
.C            C G F   C                            C G BbF
 Ooh the pain      -- Modern love can be a strain        
.C            C G F   C                            C G BbF
 Ooh the pain      -- Modern love can be a strain        
[]

 I trusted my venus was untouched in her shell
 But the pearls in her system were as tacky as hell
 For Lady Godiva I came incognito
 But her driver had stolen her red hot magneto

;Chorus
;Bridge:
.A  E
    
.E                                     C#m
 I don't know why they leave me in the lurch
.                C
 To carry on the search
.                D
 It's driving me up the wall
.E                   C#m
 When I have so much passion
.                  C
 Romance is out of fashion
.               D
 I can't handle Modern love at all

;Intro, twice

 So I worship Diana by the light of the moon
 When I pull out my pipe she screams out of tune
 In Paris my heart sinks when I see the Mona Lisa
 She gives me the wink, then shows me the freezer

;Chorus, twice</lyrics>

;Play with capo on 3rd fret.

;Intro:
.G      D      Em     C
                      

;Verse:
.G                     D
 Here comes Dick, he's wearing a skirt
.Em                             C
 Here comes Jane you know she's sportin' a chain
.G
 Same hair, a revolution
.D
 Same build, evolution
.Em                   C
 Tomorrow who's gonna fuss?
.         D                   C      G
 And they love each other so, androgynous
.D                     C
 Closer than you know, love each other so, androgynous

 Well don't get him wrong, and don't get him mad
 He might be a father but he sure ain't a dad
 And she don't need the advice that is sent to her
 She's happy with the way she looks, she's happy with her gender
 And they love each other so, androgynous
 Closer than you know, love each other so, androgynous

;Bridge:
.C                                           Em
 Mirror image, see no damage, see no evil at all
.C                                    Em
 Cupie dolls and urine stalls will be laughed at
.               D
 The way you're laughed at now

 Something meets boy and something meets girl
 They both look the same, they're overjoyed in this world
 Same hair a revolution
 Unisex evolution
 Tomorrow who's gonna fuss?

 And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants,
 Tomorrow Jane is wearing a dress
 Future outcasts and they don't last
 And today people dress the way that they please
 They way they tried to do in the last centuries

 And they love each other so, androgynous
 Closer than you know, love each other so, androgynous</lyrics>

;intro:
.Dsus2/G Dsus2/A Dsus2/B Dsus2/C
    

.            Dsus2/G         Dsus2/A
 Though I've tried before to tell her
.       Dsus2/B         Dsus2/C#      Dsus2/G Dsus2/A Dsus2/B Dsus2/C#
 Of the feelings I have for her in my heart   
.      Dsus2/G          Dsus2/A
 Every time that I come near her
.       Dsus2/B          Dsus2/C#
 I just lose my nerve As I've done
.         D        DGA    DGA    DGA
 from the start                    

[C]
.             A                 D
 Every little thing she does is magic
.               A                D
 Everything she do just turns me on
.               A                D
 Even though my life before was tragic
.              A                 Dsus2/Bb
 now I know my love for her goes on
.Dsus2/C

;repeat intro-chords

 Do I have to tell the story
 Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
 It's a big enough umbrella
 But it's always me that ends up getting wet

;chorus

.Dsus2/Bb Dsus2/C Dsus2/G Dsus2/A
    
;repeat these chords during:
 I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
 And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way
 But my silent fears have gripped me
 Long before I reach the phone
 Long before my tongue has tripped me
.                  D      DGA    DGA    DGA
 Must I always be alone?                  

;chorus (2x), while ad-libbing:
 Every little thing Every little thing Every little thing Every little thing
 Every little Every little Every little
 Every little thing she does Every little thing she does
 Every little thing she does Every little thing she does
 Thing she does is magic
 Eee oh oh...
 Every little thing Every little thing
 Every little thing she does is magic magic magic
 Magic magic magic

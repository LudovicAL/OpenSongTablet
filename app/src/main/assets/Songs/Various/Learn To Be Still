;Intro:
.F#  B   F#   B
              
.F#  B   C#   C#
              

.F#                          B
 It's just another day in paradise
.D#m                   C#
 As you stumble to your bed
.F#               B
 Give anything to silence
.D#m                  C#
 These voices ringing in your head

.D#m                      B
 You thought you would find happiness
.D#m                B
 Just over that green hill
 D#m                      A#m
 You thought you would be satisfied
.B             C#
 But you never will
.               F#B  F# B
 Learn to be still      

;Verse 2:
 Like sheep without a shepherd
 Don't know how to be alone
 So we wander 'round this desert
 Wind up following the wrong gods home

 The flock cries out for another
 They keep answering that bell
 One more starry eyed messiah
 Meets a violent farewell
 Learn to be still
 Learn to be still

;Bridge:
.C#
 Now the flowers in your garden
.B
 They don't smell so sweet so sweet
.C#
 Maybe you'd forgotten
.D#m              C#
 The heaven lying at your feet

.F# F# B  B
          
.F# F# B  B
          

;Verse 3:
 There's so many contradictions
 In all these messages we send
 Keep asking how do I get out of here
 Where do I fit in

 Though the world is torn and shakin'
 Even if your heart is breakin'
 It's waiting for you to awaken
 Someday you will
 Learn to be still

. F#      B
 Learn to be still   (repeated over and over till end of song).

 Just keep on running
 Keep on running....</lyrics>

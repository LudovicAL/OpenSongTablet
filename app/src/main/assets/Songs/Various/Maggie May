.D                C                           G
 Wake up Maggie I think I've got something to say to you
.     D                    C                G
 It's late september and I really should be back at scholl
.  C                     G      C              D
 I know I keep you amused But I feel I'm being used
.   Am                     Bm        Am7
 Oh Maggie I couldn`t have tried any more
.    Am                     D        Am                   D
 You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
.    Am                  D                       G
 You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts

.    D                     C                   G
 The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
.    D                   C                        G
 But that don't worry me none , in my eyes you're everything
.  C                   G         C                           D
 I laughed at all your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
.   Am                     Bm        Am   Bm
 Oh Maggie I couldn`t have tried any more 
.    Am                 D            Am                       D
 You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
.    Am                     D                    G
 You stole my sole that's a pain I can do without

.D                      C                G
 All I needed was was a friend to lend a guiding hand
.        D                       C                       G
 But you turned into a lover and Mother what a lover you wore me out
.        C                G              C                           D
 All you did was wreck my bed And in the morning kick me in the head 
.   Am                     Bm        Am   Bm
 Oh Maggie I couldn`t have tried any more 
.    Am                 D               Am                     D
 You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
.    Am                        D                    G
 You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried 

.D                    C                     G
 I suppose I could collect my books and get back to school
.   D                    C                    G
 Or steal my daddy's cue make a living out of playing pool
.   C                           G         C                   D
 Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand
.   Am                 Bm              Am
 Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
.           Am                        D            Am                    D
 You made a first class fool out of me, But I'm as blind as a fool can be
.    Am                   D        C7    G
 You stole my heart but I love you anyway</lyrics>

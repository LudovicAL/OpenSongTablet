;12/8 time
;intro (4 times)
.A/DG/D
    
.A/D G/D              A/D G/D                     A/D G/D
   Welcome to your life,      there's no turning back,
.                   A/D G/D
 Even while we sleep,        we will find you
.Em             F#m
 Acting on your best behavior
.G                 F#m
 Turn your back on mother nature,
.Em   F#m   G        A        A/D   G/D  A/D G/D
 Everybody wants to rule the world        

 It's my own design, it's my own remorse,
 Help me to decide, help me make the most
 Of freedom and of pleasure,
 Nothing ever lasts forever,
.Em   F#m   G       A        G
 Everybody wants to rule the world

.                         D           A
 There's a room where the light won't find you
.G                        D         A        G
 Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
.                       D      A
 When they do, I'll be right behind you

.Em            F#m
 So glad we've almost made it
.G           F#m
 So sad they had to fade it
.Em   F#m   G       A         D     GDAG DA
 Everybody wants to rule the world        

;solo

 I can't stand this indecision
 Married with a lack of vision
.Em   F#m   G       A        D     A
 Everybody wants to rule the world 

;instrumental bit:
.Bm C  Bm C  G  A  A/D G/D A/D G/D
                         
 Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it.
 One headline, why believe it?
 Everybody wants to rule the world.

 All for freedom and for pleasure,
 nothing ever lasts forever,
 Everybody wants to rule the world

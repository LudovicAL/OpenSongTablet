.   D
 My daddy was a family bassman,
 my mama was an engineer,
 and I was born one dark gray morn'
.     G                        D
 with music comin' in my ears, in my ears.

[C]
.         G
 They call me Baby Driver, and once upon a pair of wheels
.                         D           Db    Am  B7
 hit the road and I'm gone ah; what's my    num-ber,
.  Em                                        Em7
 I wonder how your engine feels, ba ba ba ba ba,
.D                    D      Db    Am  B7
 Scoot down the road, what's my    num-ber,
.  Em                           D
 I wonder how your engine feels.

 My daddy was a prominent frogman,
 my mama's in the Naval reserve,
 when I was young, I carried a gun,
 but I never got the chance to serve, I did not serve.

;Chorus

 My daddy got a big promotion,
 my mama got a raise in pay.
 There's no one home, we're all alone;
 Oh, come into my room and play, yes, we can play.

;Chorus, but first line is:
 I'm not talkin' about your pigtails, but talkin' 'bout your sex-appeal.
 hit the road and I'm gone...</lyrics>

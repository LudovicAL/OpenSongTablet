;
.        G      Em
 Almost heaven, West Virginia
.D                      C             G
 Blue Ridge Mountains, Shen-an-do-ah River
.                   Em
 life is old there, older than the trees,
. D
 younger than the mountains
.  C              G
 Growing like a breeze

[C]
.         G              D
 Country roads, take me home
.         Em       C
 to the place I belong
.         G              D
 West Virginia mountain momma
.         C             G
 take me home, country roads
[]

.        D       Em
 All my mem'ries gather 'round her
.D                C              G
 miner's lady, stranger to blue water
.                Em
 dark and dusty painted on the sky
. D
 misty taste of moonshine
. C             G
 teardrop in my eye.

.Em          D
 I hear her voice,
.        G
 in the mornin' hour she calls me
.     C       G              D
 the radio reminds me of my home far away
.      Em              F
 and drivin' down the road
.         C
 I get a feelin' that I
.  G                    D
 Should have been home yesterday</lyrics>

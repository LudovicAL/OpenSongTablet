.G C G C G C G C
               

.G             C               G         C      GCGC
  The dogs are  howling at the  midnight  moon.    
.G          C                 G           C        GCGC
  I'm on my  way to where the  black rose  blooms.    
.C               Em/B       Am        G/B
  The mountain's  high, the  night is  cold.
.C           G/B          D/A         G
  I feel the  sunshine; a  black rose  grows.

.  G                      C
 Together again, we're as  common as sin, they say,
.D                                    G
  We just walk around the stones they  throw.
.G                   C
  Night after night,  we steal away to where
.F                  C              G
  Love don't see no  colors in the  shadows,
.F                  C              G
  Love don't see no  colors in the  shadows.

.G            C         G         C      GCGC
  Wind in the  willows,  wild and  warm,    
.G              C            G           C      GCGC
  Just like the  woman lying  here in my  arms.    
.C            Em/B   Am        G/B
  The water's  deep,  cold and  still.
.C           G/B           D/A         G
  I love the  feeling that  black rose  gives.

;Chorus

;Chorus

.F                  C              G
  Love don't see no  colors in the  shadows.</lyrics>

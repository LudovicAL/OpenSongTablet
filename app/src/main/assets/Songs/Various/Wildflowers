.Bb    F      C           F
 You belong among the wildflowers
.Bb    F         C           F
 You belong in a boat out at sea
.Bb    F    C            F
 Sail away, kill off the hours
.Bb    F        C              F
 You belong somewhere you feel free

.Bb   F    C          F
 Run away, find you a lover
.Bb  F       C
 Go away somewhere all bright and new
.Bb      F   C    F
 I  have se-en no other
.Bb     F  C         F
 Who compa-ares with you

.Bb    F     C            F
 You belong among the wildflowers
.Bb    F         C
 You belong in a boat out at sea
.Bb    F              C            F
 You belong with your love on your arm
.Bb    F         C              F
 You belong somewhere you feel free

 Run away, go find a lover
.Bb   F             C             F
 Run away, let your heart be your guide
.Bb    F         C          F
 You deserve the deepest of cover
.Bb    F            C           F
 You belong in that home by and by

.Bb    F     C            F
 You belong among the wildflowers
.Bb    F        C
 You belong somewhere close to me
.Bb   F             C           F
 Far away from your trouble and worry

 You belong somewhere you feel free
.Bb    F        C              F
 You belong somewhere you feel free

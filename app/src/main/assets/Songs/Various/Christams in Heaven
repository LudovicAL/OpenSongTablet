.     G
 It's Christmas in Heaven,
.Am
 All the children sing,
.C
 It's Christmas in Heaven,
.                C  C/B C/A   G
 Hark hark those church bells ring.

.     G
 It's Christmas in Heaven,
.    Am
 The snow falls from the sky,
.         C
 But it's nice and warm

 and everyone
.                C C/B C/A G
 Looks smart and wears a   tie.

.     G
 It's Christmas in Heaven,
.        Am
 There's great films on TV,
.    C
 The Sound of Music' twice an hour
.    C        C/B C/A G
 And Jaws' I, II  and III.

.        G
 There's gifts for all the family,
.        Am
 There's toiletries and trains
.        C
 There's Sony Walkman Headphone sets
.               C/B C/A G
 And the latest video   games!

.     G
 It's Christmas it's Christmas
 Hip hip bip hip hip hooray,
.      Am             G
 Every single day, is Christmas day.

.     G
 It's Christmas it's Christmas in Heaven,
 Hip hip hip hip hip hooray,
.      Am              G
 Every single day it's Christmas day.</lyrics>

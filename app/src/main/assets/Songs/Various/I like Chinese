.G
 I like Chinese,
.A
 I like Chinese,
.     D
 They only come up to your knees,
.            G      Em
 Yet they're always friendly, and
.        Am       D
 they're ready to please.

.G
 I like Chinese,
.A
 I like Chinese,
.        D
 There's nine hundred million of
 them in the world today,
.      G               Em
 You'd better learn to like them,
.Am            D
 that's what I say.

.G
 I like Chinese,
.A
 I like Chinese,
.     D
 They come from a long way overseas,
.            G
 But they're cute and they're
.Em                  Am       D
 cuddly, and they're ready to please.

.G
 I like Chinese food,
.A
 The waiters never are rude,
.D
 Think of the many things they've
 done to impress,
.        G       Em      Am          D
 There's Maoism, Taoism, I Ching and Chess.

.   G
 So I like Chinese,
.A
 I like Chinese,
.  D
 I like their tiny little trees,
.      G          Em               Am      D
 Their Zen, their Ping-pong, their yin and yang-ese.

.G
 I like Chinese thought,
.A
 The wisdom that Confucious taught
.   D
 If Darwin is anything to shout about,
.    G              Em
 The Cinese will survive us all
.Am          D
 without any doubt.

.    G
 So, I like Chinese
.A
 I like Chinese
.     D
 They only come up to your knees,
.             G                Em
 Yet they are wise and they're witty
.        Am       D
 and are ready to please.

.G
 I like Chinese
.A
 I like Chinese
.      D
 Their food if guaranteed to please,
.  G           Em       Am            D
 A fourteen, a seven, a nine and lynchees.

.G
 I like Chinese,
.A
 I like Chinese,
.  D
 I like their tiny little trees,
.      G          Em
 Their Zen, their ping-pong,
.      Am           D
 their yin and yang-ese.

.G
 I like Chinese,

;intro (repeat during verses)
.A G/A D/A A
       

 Little Mary was five years old
 Her parents left her, she was out in the cold
 Alone to live and find her way
 In this great world of heartache and pain

 Eyes of brown, matted locks of gold
 Her flowered dress is tattered and soiled
 Tear stained cheeks, her feet cold and bare
 Who could have left a child so rare

;chorus
[C
.A    G/A       D         Dm6
 Rosemary, your day will come
.   A         G/A             D    A
 He loved you so, He gave His only Son
.         A             G/A        D            Dm6
 Keep the faith in your soul, stay down on your knees
.    E                        E7    N.C.              A    G/A D/A A
 I'm begging you please, hold on to the beads at your heart        

 A burning heart and tired eyes
 Howling winds for lullabys
 No one there to soothe her fright
 Nowhere to turn but the inward light
 Because life is for believing
 That your heart can turn to gold
 All you need is Christ to receive it
 There's eternal life for every soul

;chorus

.   Am            C/A           D/A           E7b10
 He loves you, He needs you, He wants you, so don't be afraid...
 So don't let Him down</lyrics>

.C               F           C
 Cecilia, you're breaking my heart,
.       F          C          G7
 you're shaking my confidence daily.
.    F     C      F          C
 Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees;
.    F           C              G7
 I'm begging you please to come home.

[C]
 Cecilia, you're breaking my heart,
 you're shaking my confidence daily
 Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees;
 I'm begging you please to come home.
.G7      C

;Bridge:
.       C           F
 Making love in the afternoon
.     C       F     G7    C
 with Cecilia up in my bedroom.
.                    C     F
 (Making love) I got up to wash my face,
.       C                          G7       C
 when I come back to bed someone's taken my place.

;Chorus

 Jubilation, she loves me again,
 I fall on the floor and I'm laughing,
 Jubilation, she loves me again,
 I fall on the floor and I'm laughing</lyrics>

;Introduction on Riff Four Times

 If you wanna hang out you've got to take her out, cocaine.
 If you wanna get down, down on the ground, cocaine.

.          E               D               C     B
 She don't  lie, she don't  lie, she don't  lie,  cocaine.
 Riff Twice

 If you got bad news, you wanna kick them blues, cocaine.
 When your day is done and you wanna run, cocaine.

;Chorus

;Solo on Riff Twelve Times

 If your thing is gone and you wanna ride on, cocaine.
 Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back, cocaine.

;Chorus

;Chorus

;Solo on Riff Eight Times</lyrics>

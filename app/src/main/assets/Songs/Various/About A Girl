;Nirvana (unplugged)

.E5 G      E5   G
 I need an easy friend
.E5   G      E5      G
 I do with a hand to lend
.E5   G         E5       G
 I do think you fit this shoe
.E5   G        E5     G
 I do what you have a clue

;chorus
[C]
.C#        G#        F#
 I'll take advantage while
.C#          G#     F#
 You hang me out to dry
.E5                  A5    C5    E5  G E5G
 But I can't see you every night free    
.E5  G E5G
 I do    
[]

 I'm standing in your light
 I do hope you have the time
 I do pick up number two
 I do keep a date with you

;Repeat chorus

;Solo: Repeat 3x

;Repeat first verse and chorus

.E5              A5    C5    E5   G E5G
 I can't see you every night free     
.E5  G  E5  G  E5  G  E5  G  E5 G E5G
 I do,      I do,         I do</lyrics>

 Said, said,
.C      G/B      Am                 F
 Said I remember when we used to sit
.C            G/B            Am       F
 In the government yard in Trenchtown.
.C       G/B         Am       F
 Oba, Observing the hypocrites
.              C        G/B                     Am   F
 As they would mingle   with the good people we meet,
.C            G/B            Am                     F
 Good friends we had oh      good friends we've lost
.C G/B         Am       F
 along the way..........
.C              G/B        Am               F
 In this bright future you can't forget your past
.C            G/B       Am                        F
 So dry your  tears I     say.....................And

 No woman, no cry...No woman, no cry.
 Here Little darlin', don't shed no tears, No woman, no cry.

 Said I remember when we used to sit
 In the government yard in Trenchtown.
 And then Georgie would make a firelight
 As it was love would burn in through the night.
 Then we  would cook cornmeal porridge
 of which I'll share with you.
 My feet is my only carriage,
 So, I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone
.C                   G/B          Am                  Fm   G
 Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.  Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.
.C                   G/B          Am                  Fm   G
 Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.  Ev'ry thing's gonna be alright.

 No woman, no cry...No woman, no cry.
 Here Little sister, don't shed no tears, No woman, no cry.

 Said I remember when we used to sit

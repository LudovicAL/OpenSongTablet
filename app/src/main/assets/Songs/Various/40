.  G
 I wait here patiently for my lord
.  C
 I cry and he'll hear my cry
.   G
 He lifts me up out of the pits
.    C
 And out of myre and clay

.       G   C     G      C
 I will sing, sing a new song
.       G   C     G      C
 I will sing, sing a new song

.    G   C              G   C
 How long to sing their song ?
 How long ?, how long ?
 How long to sing their song ?

 He set my feet upon the rock
 And made my footsteps firm
 Many would see
 Many would see I'm there

 And I will sing, sing a new song
 I will sing, sing a new song

 How long to sing their song ?
 How long to sing their song ?
 How long ?, how long ?
 How long to sing their song ?

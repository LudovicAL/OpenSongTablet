.E       A   Fm D
 Red red wine
.E        A   Fm D
 Go to my head
.E          A
 Make me forget that I
.D  E             A E
 I still love her so

 Red red wine
 It's up to you
 All I can do I've done
.E                  A
 But memories won't go
 Old memories won't go

;CHORUS
.         E               A
 I'd have thought that in time
.            D                  A
 Thoughts of you would leave my head
.      E            A
 I was wrong, now I find
.         D                  E
 Just one thing makes me forget

 Red red wine
 Stay close to me
 Don't let me be alone
 It's tearing apart
 My blue, blue heart

;CHORUS

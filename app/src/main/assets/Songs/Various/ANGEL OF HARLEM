;Capo at 3rd fret
;Chord progression in the verses is A  A   D   D   D

 It was a cold and wet December day
 When we touched down at JFK
 Snow was melting on the ground
 On BLS I heard the sound (of an Angel)

 New York like a Christmas tree
 I said tonight this city belongs to me (Angel)

;Chorus
.E    D         E                 D
 Soul love this love won't let me go
.E  D      E        A
 So long...Angel of Harlem

 Birdland on 53
 The street sounds like a symphony
 We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
 Miles and she has to be an Angel

 Lady Day got diamond eyes
 She sees the truth behind the lies (Angel)

;Chorus

;Bridge
.F#m     E                      F#mE
 ooh ooh ooh ooh she sings with heart
.          D
 heart and soul

 Blue light on the avenue
 God knows they got to you
 An empty glass, the lady sings
 Eyes swollen like a bee sting
 Blinded you lost your way
 On the side streets and the alleyways
 Like a star exploding in the night
 Filling up the city with broad daylight
 An Angel in Devil's shoes
 Salvation in the blues
 You never looked like an Angel
 So long...Angel of Harlem

 Angel, Angel of Harlem
;Repeat 4 times and fade</lyrics>

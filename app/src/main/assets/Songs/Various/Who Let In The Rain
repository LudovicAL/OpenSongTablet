.Bb                                        Eb Eb7m
 Things like this can always take a little time
.         Cm                 F               Bb Bb4 Bb2
 I always thought, we'd be together down the line   
.   Bb                                         Eb Eb7m
 We start to fight and can't get over what was said
.               Cm        F               Bb Bb2
 'cause you see black and white and I see red

.             Bb             Eb
 And I wonder who let in the rain
.                 Gm               F
 You know without you, I'm not the same
.     Dm                         Eb
 When love get strong people get weak
.               Dm                               Eb
 Sometimes they lose control, and wind up in too deep
.               Eb
 They fall like rain
.               Bb Bb4 Bb2
 Who let in the rain.  

 I make the bed and cover where you used to sleep
 I'm smoothing over promises made in these sheets
 I envy lovers passing by out on the street
 'cause what they have I couldn't keep

 And I wonder who let in the rain
 You know without you, I'm not the same
 When love gets strong people gets weak
 Sometimes they lose control, and wind up in too deep
 They fall like rain
 Who let in the rain.....</lyrics>

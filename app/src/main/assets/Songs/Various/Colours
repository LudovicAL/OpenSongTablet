 Yellow is the colour of my true loves hair
.       C               G
 in the morning when we rise
.       C               G
 in the morning when we rise
.           D              C               G
 That's the time thats the time I love the best

 Green's the colour of the sprklin' corn
.       C               G
 in the morning when we rise

 in the morning when we rise
.           D              C               G
 That's the time thats the time I love the best

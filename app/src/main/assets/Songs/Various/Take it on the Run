.G
 Heard it from a friend who
.C
 Heard it from a friend who
.D                                      G      Dsus     D     G
 Heard it from another you been messin' around                

 They say you got a boy friend
.C
 You're up there every weekend
.D                                              G
 They're talkin' about you and it's bringin' me down

.G
 But I know the neighborhood
.C
 And talk is cheap when the story is good
.D                                     G
 And the tales grow taller on down the line

.G
 But I'm telling you, babe
.C
 That I don't think it's true, babe
.D                              G    G  G/F#
 And even if it is keep this in mind    

;Refrain
[C
.Em
 You take it on the run baby
.C
 If that's the way you want it baby
.D                      G      G G/F#
 Then I don't want you around    
.Em
 I don't believe it
.C
 Not for a minute
.Am                                         D   Dsus     D     G
 You're under the gun so you take it on the run                
[

.G
 You're thinking up your white lies
.C
 You're putting on your bedroom eyes
.D                                            G
 You say you're coming home but you won't say when

.G
 But I can feel it coming
.C
 If you leave tonight keep running
.D                            G      G G/F#
 And you need never look back again

.G
 Heard it from a friend who

 Heard it from a friend who
.D                              C       G
 Heard it from another you been messin' around</lyrics>

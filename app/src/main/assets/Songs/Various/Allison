;Intro
.B7sus4      B         Abm        A        C#m      B       F#m       Abm
                                                                      
.           A                            E
 Oh it's so funny to be seeing you after so long girl
.        A                              G#m7           C#m     B
 And the way you look I understand that you were not impressed 
.A                               G#m7      C#m
 But I heard you let that little friend of mine
.D                         B7sus4          B7
 Take off your party dress                 

.A                    E        C#m
 I'm not going to get too sentimental
.B          A                       G#m7         C#m            B
 Like those other sticky valentines                             
.A                                   G#m7       C#m
 Because I don't know if you've been loving somebody
.  D                       B7sus4                 B7
 I only know it isn't mine                        

;Chorus
.A   E      A         B        G#m     C#m
 Allison, I know this world is killing you
.B  A  E     A  B      E
 Oh Allison, my aim is true

.A                     E
 So I see you've got a husband now
.       A                               G#m7           C#m  B
 Did he leave your pretty fingers lying in the wedding cake 
.A                                G#m7    C#m
 You used to hold him right there in your hand
.            D                       B7sus4        B7
 But did you give more than he could take          

.A                             G#m7          C#m
 Sometimes I wish that I could STOP you from talking
.B      A                              G#m7        C#m            B
 When I hear the silly things that you say                        
.A                       G#m7                  C#m
 I think somebody better turn out the big light
.          D                           B7sus4   B7
 Because I can't stand to see you this way      

;Chorus

;Repeat and fade
.D    B      E      A
 My   aim is true</lyrics>

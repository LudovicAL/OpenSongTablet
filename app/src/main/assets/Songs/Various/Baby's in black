.E        B7             A                    B7
 Oh dear, what can I do, baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
.        E   A          E   B7
 Tell me oh, what can I do  
.E                     E7                A
 She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
.    A                       E    B7               E
 And though he'll never come back she's dressed in black

.E        B7             A                    B7
 Oh dear, what can I do, baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
.        E   A          E     B7
 Tell me oh, what can I do    
.E                   E7                 A
 I think of her, but she thinks only of him
.    A                  E    B7            E
 And though it's only a whim she thinks of him

.C#m    F#                 A         B7
 Oh how long will it take / till she sees the mistake she has

.E        B7            A                    B7
 Oh dear, what can I do baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
.        E   A          E   B7
 Tell me oh, what can I do  
.E                     E7                A
 She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
.    A                       E    B7               E
 And though he'll never come back she's dressed in black

.E        B7            A                    B7
 Oh dear, what can I do baby's in black, and I'm feeling blue
.        E   A          E   B7
 Tell me oh, what can I do</lyrics>

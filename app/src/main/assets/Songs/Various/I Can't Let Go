;The Hollies

;intro:
.G
 Though I try and I try but I can't say goodbye

;verse 1:
.G                  D/F#
 Feel so bad, baby   oh, it hurts me
.C                        D
 When I think of how you love and desert me
.Dm                      C       D
 I'm the broken hearted toy you play with, baby

;chorus:
.     C
 You got me goin', I need you baby
.   Bb
 I can't let go when I want you baby
.  Am              D
 I got a habit, I know
.            G
 I can't let go

;verse 2:
 Though I'm just one   of your lovers
 And I know there are so many others
 You do something strange to me, baby (baby), baby (baby)

;(repeat chorus)

;break:
.G
 Though I try and I try but I can't say goodbye
 Know that it's wrong and I should be so strong
 But the thought of you gone makes me want to hold on

;12-string solo:
.C               D
 / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /  (x2)

;repeat chorus (x2)

;coda:
.            G   Eb D
 I can't let go         (repeat to fade)</lyrics>

. Am        Dm        G
 Swan swan hummingbird
.    Am              Dm
 Hurrah we are all free now
.       Am             Dm G
 What noisy cats are we
.          Am                  Dm
 Girl and dog he bore his cross
.    Am       Dm    G Am
 A long low time ago people talk to me

. Em                     F
 Johnny Reb what's the price of pans
. Em                F
 Forty a piece or three for one dollar
.       Em              F
 Hey captain don't you want to buy
.      Em              C    G
 Some bone chains and toothpicks

 Night weaves her hair chains
 Years you wouldn't bring back sing
 Wooden beams and dove tails sweep
 I struck that picture ninety times
 I walked that path a hundred ninety
 Long low time ago people talk to me

.    G         Bm
 A pistol hot cup of rhyme
.      C                    D
 The whiskey is water the water is wine
. G               Bm                   C            C/B
 Marching feet Johnny Reb what's the price of heroes

 Six and one half dozen the other
 Tell that to the captain's mother
 Hey captain don't you want to buy
 Some bone chains and toothpicks

 Night weaves her hair chains
 Swan swan hummingbird
 Hurrah we are all free now
 What noisy cats are we
 Long low time ago people talk to me
 A pistol hot cup of rhyme

 The whiskey is water the water is wine
;end on Am</lyrics>

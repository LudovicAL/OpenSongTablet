;Intro:
.ACGA
      (x2)

;Verse 1:
.     A                 C                 G                   A
 Love is strong, and your so sweet, you make me hard, you make me weak
.     A                 C                 G                   A
 Love is strong, and you're so sweet, and someday babe, we got to meet
.     A                 C                 G                    A
 A glimpse of you, was all it took, A stranger's glance, it got me hooked
.     A                  C                G                    A
 And I followed you, across the stars, I looked for you, in seedy bars

;back to intro

;Bridge:
.D     F         G    F    D
    What are you scared of, baby
.D     F         G      F     D
    It's more than just a dream
.D    F    G    F     D   C   A
    I need some time          
.    C           A
 We make a beautiful team
.  C            A
 A beautiful team

;Verse 2:
 Love is strong, and you're so sweet, and someday babe, we got to meet
 Just anywhere, out in the park, out on the street, and in the dark
 I followed you, through swirling seas, down darkened woods, with silent
 trees.

 Love is Strong, and you're so sweet, you make me hard, you make me weak

;Back to Bridge

;Verse 3:
 I wait for you, until the dawn, my mind is ripped, my heart is torn
 Love is strong, and you're so sweet, your love is bitter, it's taken neat

 Love is strong, yeah...etc.</lyrics>

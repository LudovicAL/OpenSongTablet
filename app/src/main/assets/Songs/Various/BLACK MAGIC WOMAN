.                     Am                         E7
 I got a black magic woman, I got a black magic woman
.          Am                                      Dm
 I got a black magic woman got me so blind I can't see
.              Am                      E                           Am
 that she's a black magic woman she's try'in to make a devil out of me

 Turn your back on me baby, turn your back on me baby
 Turn your back on me baby stop messin' around with your tricks
 Don't turn your back on me baby you might just pick up my magic sticks

 Got your spell on me baby, got your spell on me baby
 Got your spell on me baby turnin my heart into stone
 I need you so bad magic woman I can't leave you alone</lyrics>

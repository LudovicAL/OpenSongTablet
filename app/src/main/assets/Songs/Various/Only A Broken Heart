.       Am7 Dm G C
[Intro]        (twice)

.Am7             Dm
 Here comes that feeling
.G            C
 I've seen in your eyes
.Am7         Dm
 Back in the old days
.G          C
 before the hard times

.    E7      Am     Am7/G  D/F#
 But I'm not afraid anymore
.C           G      C
 it's only a broken heart

.Am7        Dm
 I know the place where
.G             C
 you keep your secrets
.Am7        Dm
 out of the sunshine
.G         C
 down in a valley

.    E7      Am     Am7/G  D/F#
 but I'm not afraid anymore
.C           G      C
 it's only a broken heart

.Bb          Am
 what would I give
.Bb                 Am
 to start all over again
.Bb          Am    G   Gsus4 G
 to clean up my mistakes     

 stand in the moonlight
 stand under heaven
 wait for an answer
 hold out forever

 but don't be afraid anymore
 it's only a broken heart

 what would I give
 to start all over again
 to clean up my mistakes

 I know your weakness
 you've seen my dark side
 the end of the rainbow
 is always a long ride

 but don't be afraid anymore
 it's only a broken heart
 it's only a broken heart

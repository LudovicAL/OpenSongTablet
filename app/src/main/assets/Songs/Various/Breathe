 Em      A       Em      A       etc

.Em                      A
 Breathe, breathe in the air
.Em                 A
 Don't be afraid to care
.Em                    A
 Leave but don't leave me
.Em                             A
 Look around and chose your own ground
.    C
 For long you live and high you fly
.    Bm
 And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
.    F
 And all you touch and all you see
.   G                  G7   B
 Is all your life will ever be

 Unfortunately I'm not sure about this last line.
 It might be completely wrong. If so, feel free to correct.
 Here's the rest of the lyrics, same chords should apply...

 Run, run rabbit run
 Dig that hole, forget the sun,
 And when at last the work is done
 Don't sit down it's time to start another one
 For long you live and high you fly
 But only if you ride the tide
 And balanced on the biggest wave
 You race toward an early grave.

 (and right after the last chord of "Time" theres...)
 Breathe Reprise

 Home, home again
 I like to be there when UI can
 When I come in cold and tired
 It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
 Far away across the field
 The tolling of the iron bell
 Calls the faithful to their knees
 To hear the softly spoken magic spells.</lyrics>

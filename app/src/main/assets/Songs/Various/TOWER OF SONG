.G
 Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
 I ache in the places where I used to play
.       C                                     G
 And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on 
.        D                    C
 I'm just paying my rent everyday
.                  G
 In the Tower of Song

 I said to Hank Williams: How lonely does it get?
 Hank Williams hasn't answered yet.
.       C                             G
 But I hear him coughing all night long
.      D                   C
 A hundred floors above me 
.                  G
 In the Tower of Song

 I was born like this, I had no choice.
 I was born with the gift of a golden voice.
.       C                                    G
 And twenty-seven angels from the Great beyond
.       D                            C
 They tied me to this table right here
.                   G
 In the Tower of Song

 So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
 I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
 I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
 They don't let a woman kill you, not
 In the Tower of Song

 Now you can say that I've grown bitter, but of this you may be sure:
 The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
 And there's a mighty judgment coming  But I may be wrong
 You see, you hear these funny voices
 In the Tower of Song

.Em                              D
 I see you standing on the other side
.Em                         D
 I don't know how the river got so wide
.    C                           G
 I loved you, baby, way back when
.Em                                     D
 And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
.Em                             D
 But I feel so close to everything that we lost
.     C                          D
 We'll never have to lose it again

. G
 I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
 They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
.               C                                    G
 But You'll be hearing from me, baby. Long after I'm gone
.         D                              C
 I'll be speaking to you sweetly from a window
.             G

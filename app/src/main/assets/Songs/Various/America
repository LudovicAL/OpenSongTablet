;Simon and Garfunkel

;Capo at 2nd fret
.C         Cmaj7         Am        C/G         F
 Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
.C             Cmaj7       Am
 I've got some real-estate here in my bag
.Em                     A7             Em          A7
 So we bought a pack of cigaretts, and Mrs. Wagner pies
.Em  D      C      Em       C Cmaj7     Am     C/G     F
 And walked off to look for America                    

.C       Cmaj7      Am          C/G          F
 Kathy I said as we boarded the Greyhound in Pittsburg
.C        Cmaj7        Am
 Michigan seems like a dream to me now
.Em
 It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saginaw
.D    Em       D       C     Cmaj7
 I've come to look for America

;Bridge
.                F                                           C
 Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces           
.                F                                            C
 She said the man in the gaberdine suit was a spy             
.                F                        C     Cmaj7       Am       C/G     F
 I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera                             

.C         Cmaj7     Am              C/G       F
 Toss me a cigarette I think there's one in my raincoat
.C             Cmaj7       Am
 We smoked the last one an hour ago
.Em                 A7           Em               A7
 So I looked at the scenery, and she read her magazine
.        D    C    Em      C   Cmaj7                   Am              C/G        F
 And the moon rose over an open field                                             

.C         Cmaj7   Am             C/G          F
 Kathy I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping
.    C         Cmaj7      Am
 I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
.Em
 Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
.        D   Em      D        Cmaj7 C
 They've all gone to look for America</lyrics>

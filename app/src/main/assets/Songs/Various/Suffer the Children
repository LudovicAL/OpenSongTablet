.G
 It's a sad affair,
.G7
 when there's no one there,
.C                   G
 He calls out in the night.
.G
 And it's so unfair,
.G7
 at least it seems that way,
.     C                G
 when you gave him his life.

[C
.    F
 And all this time he's been getting you down,
.             C
 You ought to pick him up when there's no one around,
.       F
 And convince him,
.        C
 Oh just talk to him,
.         F
 Cause he knows in his heart you won't be home soon,
.            C
 And he's an only child in an only room
.         F
 And he's dependent on you
.        C
 Oh he's dependent on you
[

.G
 And it seems so strange,
.G7
 That at the end of the day,
.C                     G
 Making love can be so good,
.G
 But the pain of birth,
.G7
 Oh what is it worth,
.              C                        G
 When it don't turn out the way that it should

;Chorus

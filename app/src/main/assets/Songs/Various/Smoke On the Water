.G
 We all came down to Montreux
.              F    G
 on the Lake Geneva shoreline
.G
 To make records with the mobile
.          F         G
 We didn't have much time
.G
 Frank Zappa and the mothers
.                 F      G
 were at the best place around
.G
 But some stupid with a flare-gun
.                 F      G
 burned the place to the ground

.C            Ab
 Smoke on the water
.G
 a fire in the sky
.C            Ab
 Smoke on the water

 They burned down the gambling house
 it died with an awful sound
 A funky claude was running in and out
 pulling kids out the ground
 When it all was over
 we had to find another place
 But Swiss time was running out
 it seemed that we would lose the race

 Smoke on the water
 a fire in the sky
 Smoke on the water

 We ended up at the Grand Hotel
 it was empty cold and bare
 But with the rolling truck stones thing outside
 making our music there
 With a few red lights and a few old beds
 we made a place to sweat
 No matter what we get out of this
 I know well never forget

 Smoke on the water
 a fire in the sky
 Smoke on the water</lyrics>

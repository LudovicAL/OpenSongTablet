;Here's the 'overture' to one of the finest albums in rock history:

.Cm Ab Cm  G+  G
               
.F                               G   G   Gb  F
 They say some days you're gonna win,        
.                                 G   G   Gb   F
 They say some days you're gonna lose.         
.                           G G   Gb F
 I tell you I got news for you       
.                                    G
 Your losin' all the time you never win
.C                               E                           F  Fm
 If you believe that's how it's gonna be I'd better put you down
.C                                E
 Get off your tightrope up there come down on he ground
.           F
 You gotta save me now,
.            Fm
 You better turn around.
.Am            F           Am              D7
      When I looked around,        I was heading down.
. C     G     Am   C7   F       E7     Am
 Won't some - bo - dy throw me down a line.

 They say some days you gotta give--
 They say some days you gotta take--
 If that's the way it's gotta be,
 Roll it over and you will see.
 The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time.
 The change from night to day is really only hours,
 It's just along the line can't you see the sign
 When I looked around, I was heading down,
 Won't somebody throw me down a line.

 I want to look you straight in the eye,
 I want to tell you how I really feel,
.F                      G      Gb
 I can feel the wheels turnin' round,
 Won't somebody throw me down a line
 The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time,
 The change from night to day is really only hours
 It's just along the line, can't you see the sign
 When I closed my eyes, I was so surprised
. C  G Am  C7  F         E7       Am                D7
 Somebody had thrown me down the line--stopped me drownin'
. C  G Am  C7  F         G         CmAbmCm G+ G  C
 Somebody had thrown me down the line</lyrics>

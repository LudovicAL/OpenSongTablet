;CAPO: 5th fret

;INTRO:
.C   C/B  Fsus4  F   C   C/B   Fsus4   G
 --- ---- ------ --- --- ----- ------- -----

.C         C/B          C7sus4
 When you look into my eyes
.        F             Dm7         G
 And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul
.C         C/B           C7sus4
 It always comes as a surprise
.       F                Dm7            G
 When I feel my withered roots begin to grow.

.       Em7         Em7                F       F/E  Dm7
 Well I never had a place that I could call my very own
.    F                  G                      C   C/B Fsus4
 But that's alright, my love, 'cause you're my home.   

.C        C/B            C7sus4
 When you touch my weary head
.        F            Dm7             G
 And you tell me everything will be alright
.          C      C/B           C7sus4
 You say, "Use my body for your bed.
.       F                  Dm7                 G
 And my love will keep you warm throughout the night."

.       Em7        Em7               F     F/E Dm7
 Well I never be a stranger and I'll never be  alone
.    F            G                 C       CC/
 Wherever we're together, that's my home.    

.Am              G            C          CC/
 Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike,   

.Am        G             F
 Indiana's early morning dew, oh!
.Am             G            C        CC/
 High up in the hills of California,   
.Am            G               F
 Home is just another word for you.

;Piano solo - same chords as verses

.       Em7         Em7                F       F/E  Dm7
 Well I never had a place that I could call my very own.
.    F                  G                      C   C/B Fsus4
 But that's alright, my love, 'cause you're my home.   

.C        C/B           C7sus4
 And if I travel all my life
.      F            Dm7             G
 And I never get to stop and settle down
.C         C/B            C7sus4
 Long as I have you by my side, oh
.        F                 Dm7              G
 There's room for love and good wars(?) all around.

.          Em7               Em7           F       F/E      Dm7
 You're my castle, you're my cabin, and my instant pleasure dome.
.  F              G                       C   C/B Fsus4
 I need you in my house, 'cause you're my home.   
.          C  C/B   Fsus4 G C C/B Fsus4 G C C/B Fsus4
 You're my ho - me.</lyrics>

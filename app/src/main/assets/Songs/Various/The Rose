.         C             G7          F          G      C
 Some say love, it is a river, that drowns the tender reed
.         C               G7        F          G       C
 Some say love, it is a razor, that leads your soul to bleed
.         Cmaj7        F                          G7
 Some say love it is a hunger, and endless aching need
.      C            G          F            C
 I say love it is a flower and you its only seed

.         C               G7            F     G         C
 It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance
.         C               G7          F     G       C
 It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes a chance
.         Em                Am7       F              G
 It's the one, who won't be taken who cannot seem to give
.        C              G          F     G         C
 And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live

.         C                  G7             F        G        C
 When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long
.        C                 G7           F     G       C
 And you find that love is only for the lucky and the strong
.       Em            Am7          F               G
 Just remember in the winter for 'neath the bitter snow
.         C                  G                  F        G         C
 Lies the seed that with the sun's love, in the spring becomes the rose</lyrics>

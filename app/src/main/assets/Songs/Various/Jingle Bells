.G
 Dashing through the snow
.                    C
 On a one-horse open sleigh
 O'er the fields we go
.Am       D7  C   G
 Laughing all the way
 Bells on bob-tail ring
.               C
 Making spirits bright
.     Am           D
 What fun it is to ride and sing
.  D7              G
 A sleighing song tonight

[C]
.    G                                  C       G
 Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
.C               G
 Oh, what fun it is to ride
.     A7             D
 In a one-horse open sleigh
.G                                  C       G
 Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the way
.C           G
 What fun it is to ride
.     D7             G
 In a one-horse open sleigh.

 A day or two ago
 I thought I'd take a ride
 And soon Miss Fanny Bright
 Was seated by my side;
 The horse was lean and lank
 Misfortune seemed his lot,
 We ran into a drifted bank
 And there we got upsot.

 A day or two ago
 The story I must tell
 I went out on the snow
 And on my back I fell;
 A gent was riding by
 In a one-horse open sleigh
 He laughed at me as I there sprawling laid
 But quickly drove away.

 Now the ground is white,
 Go it while you're young,
 Take the girls along
 And sing this sleighing song.
 Just bet a bob-tailed bay,
 Two-forty as his speed,
 Hitch him to an open sleigh
 and crack! You'll take the lead.</lyrics>

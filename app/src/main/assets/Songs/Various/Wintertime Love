[V]
.Em7         D         F          C
 Wintertime winds blow cold this season
.Dm          F       Bb       A
 Fallin in love I'm hopin to be
.Em          D        F        C
 Wind is so cold, is that the reason
.Dm           F          Bb            A E A
 Keeping you warm, your hands touching me  

[C]
.G               D        D7
 Come with me, dance, my dear
.F#                     Bm
 Winter's so cold this year
.G           A        G          A       DA E A
 You are so warm, my wintertime love to be    

 Additional verse:

 Wintertime winds blue and freezin
 Comin from northern storms in the sea
 Love has been lost, is that the reason
 Trying so desperately to be free</lyrics>

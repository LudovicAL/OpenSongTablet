.       Fmaj7            E7sus4 E7   Em7          Am7
 Why do birds suddenly appear  every time you are near
.Fmaj7                         Cmaj7
 Just like me, they long to be Close to you

.       Fmaj7                    E7sus4 E7  Em7           Am7
 Why do start fall down from the sky  every time you walk by?
.Fmaj7                         Cmaj7
 Just like me, they long to be Close to you

.F
 On the day that you were born the angels got together
.      Em7                          A7sus4 A7
 And decided to create a dream come true 
.        F                                                                      G
 So they springled moon dust in your hair of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue

.        Fmaj7               E7sus4 E7    Em7      Am7
 That is why all the boys in town  follow you all around

;Repeat and fade
.Fmaj7                         Cmaj7        C
 Just like me, they long to be Close to you</lyrics>

 1. Hey there,
.            E                                      F#
 where you going with that load of nothing in your hand?
.  F#        F#7
 I said hey, there,
.              E                 F#
 I feel this green and pleasant wind.

.     B             E            F#
 I'm going down to Liverpool do nothing
.     B             E            F#
 I'm going down to Liverpool do nothing
.     B             E            F#
 I'm going down to Liverpool do nothing
.                    B
 All the days of my life.

 2. Hey, where you going with that UB-40 in your hand
 I said hey, there,
 I feel this green and pleasant wind.</lyrics>

;Verse
.D              A/C#
 Maybe I didn't love you
.Bm       D/A        G            A
 Quite as often as I could have   
.D                  A/C#
 And maybe I didn't treat you
.Bm       D/A       G#m7-5
 Quite as good as I should have

;Bridge
.G                   D
 If I made you feel second best
.G            D/F#      Em
 Girl I'm sorry I was blind
.A        Bm     A7/C# D      Em   F#m
 You were always on my mind        
.G        A7            D     G     A
 You were always on my mind         

;Verse
 And maybe I didn't hold you
 All those lonely, lonely times
 And I guess I never told you
 I'm so happy that you're mine

;Bridge
 Little things I should have said and done
 I just never took the time
 You were always on my mind
 You were always on my mind

.D          A/C#   Bm       D/A
 Tell_____________ me,      
.G                 D/F#               Em    G/A  A7
 Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died        
.D          A/C#   Bm       D/A
 Give_____________ me,       give me
.G                    D/F#
 one more chance to keep you satis-
. Em         A
 fied I'll keep you satis-</lyrics>

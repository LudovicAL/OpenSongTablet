.          A           E
 I got the  key to the  highway,
.D
  Billed out and bound to go.
.          A
 I'm gonna  leave here running;
.E                   A      DAE
  Walking's much too  slow.   

.          A            E
 I'm going  back to the  border
.D
  Woman, where I'm better known.
.             A
 You know you  haven't done nothing,
.E                           A      DAE
  Drove a good man away from  home.   

.         A                    E
 When the  blue peeks over the  mountains
.D
  I'll be on my way.
.          A
 I'm gonna  roam this old highway
.E                   A     DAE
  Until the break of  day.   

.           A                   E
 Oh give me  one, one more kiss  mama
.D
  Just before I go,
.              A
 'Cause when I  leave this time you know I,
.E                   A      DAE
  I won't be back no  more.</lyrics>

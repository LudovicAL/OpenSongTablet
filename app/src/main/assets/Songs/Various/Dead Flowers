;Intro
.D9     D      A      G      D
                             
.D9   D                   A             G                D
 Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
.D9    D         A                  G     D
 Talking to some rich folk that you know  
.D9   D                    A        G           D
 Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
.D9    D                A          G  D
 Cause you know I could never be alone

.        A                          D    D9  D  D9  D
 Take me down little Susie, take me down            
.A                                             D     D9  D
 I know you think you're the queen of the underground    

;Chorus
.            G                          D      D9  D
 And you can send me dead flowers every morning    
.G                           D    D9   D
 Send me dead flowers by the mail      
.G                          D         D9   D
 Send me dead flowers to my wedding        
.D                        A             G   D
 And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

.D9   D                   A            G             D
 Well when you're sitting back in your rose pink cadillac
.D9     D          A           G     D
 Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day   tucky erby
.D9   D                      A           G            D
 Well I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
.D9  D               A             G  D
 And another girl to take my pain away

.        A                          D    D9  D  D9  D
 Take me down little Susie, take me down            
.A                                             D     D9  D
 I know you think you're the queen of the underground

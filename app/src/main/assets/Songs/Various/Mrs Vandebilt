 Am    E

.Am
 Down in the jungle living in a tent
.    E
 You don't use money you don't pay rent
 You don't even know the time
.              Am
 But you don't mind.

.       E
 Ho Hey Ho
.       Am
 Ho Hey Ho
.       E
 Ho Hey Ho
.       Am
 Ho Hey Ho

.                          E
 When your light is on the blink
.                        Am
 You never think of worrying
.E                      Am
 What's the use of worrying?
.                           E
 When your bus has left the stop
.                            Am
 You'd better drop your hurrying
.E                      Am
 What's the use of hurrying

.Dm         Dm/C    G
 Leave me alone Mrs Vandebilt
.         C                    Em
 I've got plenty of time of my own

 Dm    Am

.E                      Am
 What's the use of worrying?
.E                      Am
 What's the use of hurrying?
.E                 (Bm)  Am
 What's the use of any - thing`

.       E
 Ho Hey Ho
.       Am
 Ho Hey Ho
.       E
 Ho Hey Ho
.       Am
 Ho Hey Ho

.          Am             E
 When your pile is on the wane
.                           Am
 You don't complain of robery
.E              Am
 Run away don't bother me
.E                     Am
 What's the use of worrying?
.E                 (Bm)  Am
 What's the use of any - thing?

.Dm         Dm/C    G
 Leave me alone Mrs Washinton
.         C                    Em
 I've got plenty of time of my own

 Dm    Am

.E                      Am
 What's the use of worrying?
.E                      Am
 What's the use of hurrying? (no use!)
.E                     Am
 What's the use of anything?

.       E
 Ho Hey Ho
.       Am
 Ho Hey Ho
.       E
 Ho Hey Ho
.       Am

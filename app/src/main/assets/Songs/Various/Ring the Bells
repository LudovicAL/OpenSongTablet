.C             G
 Ring ring the bells
.         F
 Wake the town
.      C      G
 Every one is sleeping
.C            G
 Shout at the crowd
.          F
 Wake them up
.            C           G
 This angers deeper than sleep

.C
 Got to keep awake to whats happening
.G
 I can't see a thing through my ambition,
.F                                     C    G
 I no longer feel that God is watching over me
.C
 Got to tell the world we've all been dreaming
.G
 This is not the end, a new begining
.F                                     C    G
 I no longer feel that God is watching over me

 Break break the code
 Concentrate
 Let the doors swing open
 See through all your walls
 All your floors
 Now your in deeper than sleep

 Got to keep awake to whats happening
 I can't see a thing through my ambition
 I no longer feel that God is watching over me
 Got to tell the world we've all been dreaming
 This is not the end, a new begining
 I no longer feel that God is watching over me

 When you let me fall
 Grew my own wings
 Now I'm as tall as the sky
 When you let me drown
 Grew gills and fins
 Now I'm as deep as the sea
 When you let me die
 My spirit's free
 There's nothing challenging me.</lyrics>

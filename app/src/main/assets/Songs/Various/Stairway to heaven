 Intro, [V]

 (with flute...)

 V1:
.          Am         G#+           C           D
 There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
.          Fmaj7                G  Am
 and she's buying a stairway to heaven
.         Am             G#+          C              D
 When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
.       Fmaj7                     G    Am
 with a word she can get what she came for
.C  D  Fmaj7  Am
 Oh___ oh____ 
.          C        G           D
 and she's buying a stairway to heaven

 V2:
.          C           D            Fmaj7       Am
 There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
.           C              D              Fmaj7
 'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
.     Am          G#+             C            D
 In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
.          Fmaj7                   G  Am
 Sometimes all of her thoughts are misgiven

 (strumming...)

.C         G          Am
 feeling I get when I look to the west
.       C         G          F  Am
 and my spirit is crying for leaving
.      C               G             Am
 In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
.        C         G               F  Am
 and the voices of those who stand looking

.Am7  Dsus4    D                  Am7
         Oh___ it makes me wonder 
.Em   D    C    D
                
.Am7  Dsus4 D
 Oh___ it really makes me
.       Am7  Em   D    C    D
 wonder                     

 And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
 then the piper will lead us to reason
 And the new day will dawn for those who stand long
 and the forest will echo with laughter

 If theres a bustle in your hedgerow dont be alarmed now
 it's just a spring clean for the May queen
 Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run
 there's still time to change the road you're on

 Your head is humming and it wont go in case you dont know
 the piper's calling you to join him
 Dear lady can you hear the wind blow and did you know
 your stairway lies on the whispering wind

;For the solo and the remaining lyrics use a Am  G  F  G  barre chord sequence

;Solo

 And as we wind on down the road
 Our shadows taller than our soul
 There walks the lady we all know
 Who shines white light and wants to know
 how everything still turns to gold
 And if you listen very hard
 the time will come to you at last
 When all are one and one is all
 To be a rock and not to roll

 (unaccomp.)
 And she's buying a stairway to heaven</lyrics>

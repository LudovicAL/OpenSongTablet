.C
 I used to hurry a lot

 I used to worry a lot
.          F
 I used to stay out till the break of day
.C
 Oh that didn't git it

 It was high time I quit it
.       F
 I just couldn't carry on that way
.Am
 Oh, I did some damage, I know it's true
.       F
 Didn't know I was so lonely till I found you
.C
 You can go the distance

 We'll find out
.       F
 In the long run (in the long run)
.       C
 We can handle some resistance

 if our love
.     F
 is a strong one(is a strong one)
.       Am
 People talkin' about us

 they got nothin' else to do
.        F
 When it all comes down

 we will still come through
.       C
 In the long run
.    F
 Ooh I want to tell you
.       C       G G7
 it's a long run</lyrics>

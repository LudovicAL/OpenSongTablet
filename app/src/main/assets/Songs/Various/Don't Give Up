.   Cm                 Bb/C    Cm
 In this proud land we grew up strong
.Bb/D    Eb          Ab/EbEb
 We were wanted all along 
.      Bb               Eb/Bb     Bb
 I was taught to fight, taught to win
.        Cm        Bb/C  Cm
 I never thought I could fail

 No fight left or so it seems
 I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
 I've changed my face, I've changed my name
 But no one wants you when you lose

;chorus
[C]
.Ab/F       Eb/G           Cm7/Ab
      Don't give up - 'cos you have friends
.Ab/F       Eb/G                 Cm/Ab
      Don't give up - you're not beaten yet
.Ab/F       Eb/G        Ab           Bb
      Don't give up - I know you can make it good
[]

 Though I saw it all around
 Never thought I could be affected
 Thought that we'd be the last to go
 It is so strange the way things turn

 Drove the night toward my home
 The place that I was born, on the lakeside
 As daylight broke, I saw the earth
 The trees had burned down to the ground

 Don't give up - you still have us
 Don't give up - we don't need much of anything
.                     Ab                  Bm             Eb      Ab/Eb-Eb
 Don't give up - 'cos somewhere there's a place where we belong  

.          Bb   Eb/Bb Bb
 Rest your head   
.              Eb   Ab/Eb Eb
 You worry too much   
.                 Bb    Eb/Bb Bb
 It's going to be alright 
.     Eb                            Ab      Eb
 When times get rough, you can fall back on us,
.           Eb  Bb        Eb            Ab/Eb-Eb
 Don't give up,    please don't give up 

.       Eb                        Bb
 Got to walk out of here, I can't take anymore
.         Eb                            Ab
 Going to stand on that bridge, keep my eyes down below
.    Eb                    Bb
 Whatever may come and whatever may go,
.             Eb       Bb              Eb       Ab/Eb Eb
 That river's flowing,    that river's flowing    

 Moved on to another town
 Tried hard to settle down
 For every job, so many men
 So many men no-one needs

 Don't give up - 'cos you have friends
 Don't give up - you're not the only one
 Don't give up - no reason to be ashamed
 Don't give up - you still have us
 Don't give up now - we're proud of who you are
 Don't give up - you know it's never been easy
.                       Ab                Bb
 Don't give up - 'cos I believe there's a place
.Bb                       Eb
 There's a place where we belong

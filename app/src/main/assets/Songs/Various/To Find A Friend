[Intro]    

.       A             D
 In the middle of his life
.A           D
 He left his wife
.F#m               Bm
 And ran off to be bad
.F#m         Bm E
 Boy, it was sad

.        A           D
 But he bought a new car
.A           D
 Found a new bar
.F#m                    Bm
 And went under another name
.F#m                 Bm  E
 Created a whole new game

.E F#    G    G/F#bass Asus4  D Asus4  Bm
 And the days went by like paper in the wind
.G    G/F#  Asus4    D    Asus4   Bm
 Everything changed, then changed again
.G                   D
 It's hard to find a friend
.G                   D      Asus4  Bm
 It's hard to find a friend        

 Meanwhile then
 His wife's boyfriend moved in and
 Took over the house
 Everybody was as quiet as a mouse
 And it changed their lives
 Changed their plans
 Slowly they grew apart
 Boy, it woulda broke your heart

 And the days went by like paper in the wind
 Everything changed, then changed again
 It's hard to find a friend
 It's hard to find a friend

 (honky tonk piano solo)

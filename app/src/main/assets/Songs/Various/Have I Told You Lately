;intro (piano)
.E  Abm7 AB   E  Abm7 AB
                       
.Amaj7 Abm7 F#m7 A/B E B7
                 

.       E        Abm7          A           B
 Have I told you lately that I love you?   
.        E               Abm7            A         B
 Have I told you there's no one else above you?    
.Abmaj7                       Abm7
 Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness,
.F#m7    A/B                        E  B7
 ease my troubles that's what you do.  

 For the morning sun in all it's glory
 greets the day with hope and comfort, too.
 You fill my life with laughter and somehow you make it better,
 ease my troubles that's what you do.

.F#m7 E/G#
    
;Chorus:
[C]
.Amaj7
 There's a love that's divine
.                               Abm7
 and it's yours and it's mine....like the sun.
.Amaj7
 And at the end of the day
.                               Abm7        A/B
 we should give thanks and pray to the one, to the one.

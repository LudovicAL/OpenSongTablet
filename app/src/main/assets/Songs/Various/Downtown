.G            Bm               C          D7              G      Bm
 When you're alone and life is making you lonely, you can always go
.C   D
 Downtown
.G            Bm               C             D7             G      Bm
 When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry seems to help I know
.C   D
 Downtown

.     G                          Em
 Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
.G                                Em
 Linger on the sidewalk where the neon lights are pretty
.Bm
 How can you lose ?

.C
 The lights are much brighter there,
.           A/G
 you can forget all your troubles,
 forget all you cares

.      G   Bm
 So go downtown,
.C              D                 G   Bm
 things will be great when you're downtown
.C        D               G   Bm
 No finer place for sure, downtown
.C            D           G
 Ev'rything's waiting for you

.         Fmaj7      Em7
 You know Dasher and Dancer
.    Dm7         Cmaj7
 And Prancer and Vixen,
.Fmaj7     Em7
 Comet and Cupid
.    Dm7        Cmaj7
 And Donner and Blitzen.
.    Am E7  Am
 But do you recall
.    D9          Gsus4       G7
 The most famous reindeer of all?

.C
 Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer)
.                 G7
 Had a very shiny nose (like a light bulb)
 And if you ever saw it (saw it)
.                      C
 You would even say it glows (like a flash light)
 All of the other reindeer (reindeer)
.                           G7
 Used to laugh and call him names (like Pinochio)
 They wouldn't let poor Rudolph (Rudolph)
.                     C
 Play in any reindeer games (like Monopoly)

.F              Em7       A7
 Then one foggy Christmas Eve
.Dm7   G7      C
 Santa came to say (Ho Ho Ho)
.G7                Em
 Rudolph with your nose so bright
.Am7       D7       Dm7    G7
 Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
.C
 Then all the reindeer loved him (loved him)
.                          G7
 And they shouted out with glee (yippee)
 Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer)
.                  C
 You'll go down in history (like Columbus)</lyrics>

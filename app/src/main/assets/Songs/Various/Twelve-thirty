;The Mamas and the Papas

.Em Em7     Am7    A7        D  D7
 I used to live in New York City
.Em   Em7     Am7      A7        D  D7
 Everything there was dark and dirty
.Em   Em7    Am7    A7     D    Bb D
 Outside my window was a steeple
.Em      Em7        Eb            D
 With a clock that always said 12:30

.G                              D
 Young girls are coming to the canyon
.C           Em                     D
 And in the morning I can see them walking
.G                         D
 I can no longer keep my blinds drawn
.C             Cm              G
 And I can't keep myself from talking.

 At first so strange to feel so friendly
 To say good morning and really mean it
 To feel these changes happening in me
 But not to notice till I feel it.

;Chorus

 Cloudy waters cast no reflection
 Images of beauty lie there stagnant
 Vibrations bounce in no direction
 And lie there shattered into fragments.</lyrics>

.G                             C
 I'm looking for a hard headed woman
.Cm            F             Dm   Am
  One who will take me for myself 
.Bb        G       C           F
  And If I find my hard-headed woman
.Bb         C         F         Am     Dm
  I won't need nobody else, no, no, no 

.G                              C
  I'm looking for a hard headed woman
.Cm            F             Dm   Am
  One who will make me do my best 
.Bb        G       C           F
  And If I find my hard-headed woman
.Bb         C                       F             Am       Dm
 I know the rest of my life will be blessed, yes, yes, yes 

.G                     C
 I know a lot of fancy dancers
.Cm              F              Dm   Am
  People who can glide you on a floor
.FBb        F        Bb        F  C
  They move so smooth but have no answer
.Gm            C                         FAm
  When you ask why'd you come here for ?  

.Am          D              Am                D               F
 I know many fine feathered friends but their friendliness depends
.   E
 on how you do
.Am             D          Am           D               F
 They know many sure fired ways to find out the one who pays
.    E          ADm
 and how you do  

.    G                         C
 I'm looking for a hard headed woman
.Cm            F            Dm   Am
  One who will make feel so good 
.Bb        G       C           F
  And if I find my hard-headed woman
.Gm         C                  F          Am      Dm
  I know my life will be as it should yes yes yes</lyrics>

 De de de de de de de de de de de de de

[C]
.D             G        Em
 And here's to you Mrs. Robinson
.G               Em                 C     Am      D
 Jesus loves you more than you will know, wo wo wo
.D             G           Em
 God bless you please Mrs. Robinson
.G              Em                  C     Am
 Heaven holds a place for those who pray, hey hey hey

[V1]
.E7
 We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
.A
 We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
.D               G               C           Am
 Look around you all you see are sympathetic eyes
.E7                          D
 Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

;Chorus

[V2]
.E7
 Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
.A
 Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
.D             G               C           Am
 It's a little secret just the Robinsons' afair
.E7                        D
 Most of all you've got to hide it from the kids

[C]
.D          G         Em
 Koo koo ka choo Mrs. Robinson
.G               Em                 C     Am      D
 Jesus loves you more than you will know, wo wo wo
.D             G           Em
 God bless you please Mrs. Robinson
.G              Em                  C     Am
 Heaven holds a place for those who pray, hey hey hey

[V3]
.E7
 Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
.A
 Going to the candidates debate
.D              G              C                  Am
 Laugh about it shout about it when you've got to choose
.E7                         D
 Any way you look at it you lose

[C]
.D              G          Em
 Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
.G                  Em             C    Am         D
 A nation turns its lonely eyes to you, woo woo woo
.D               G        Em
 What's that you say Mrs. Robinson
.G               Em            C     Am                   E7
 Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, hey hey hey, hey hey hey</lyrics>

;Intro
.D     F#m     G      D     G     D
                                  
.D                 F#m              G
 I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before
.D             F#m        G
 Never been so easy or so slow
.          D               F#m                 G
 I've been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wron
g
.D                    G                 D
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

.D                F#m              G
 Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love
.D           F#m         G
 It's always hit me from below
.    D                     F#m           G
 But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct
.D                    G                 D
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

.D              F#m              G
 Purple clover, Queen Anne Lace, crimson hair across your face
.D                 F#m              G
 You could make me cry if you don't know
.D                         F#m              G
 Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love
.D                    G                 D
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

.G                                D
 Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
.G                                  D
 Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
.E
 Blue river running slow and lazy
.Asus                               A
 I could stay with you forever, and never realize the time

.D               F#m          G
 Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad
.D                   F#m             G
 Mine have been like Verlaine and Rimbaud
.    D                F#m         G
 But there's no way I can compare all those scenes to this affair
.D                    G                 D
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

.G                                    D
 You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
.G                          D
 Staying far behind without you
.E
 You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
.Asus                               A
 You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to

.     D               F#m       G
 I'll look for you in Honolulu, San Francisco, Ashtabula
.D                    F#m             G
 You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
.         D              F#m                 G
 But I'll see you in the stars above, in the tall grass and the ones I love
.D                    G                 D
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
.         D              F#m                 G
 Yes I'll see you in the stars above, in the tall grass and the ones I love
.D                    G                 D
 You're gonna make me lonesome when you go</lyrics>

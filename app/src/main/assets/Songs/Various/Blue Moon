;Chorus
[C]
.     Eb    CmFm        Bb7          Eb
 Blue moon,   you saw me standing alone
.Cm Fm          Bb7      Eb
 without a dream in my heart
.Cm Fm          Bb7   Eb
 without a love of my own
[]

.Bb7  Eb    CmFm                Bb7
 Blue moon,   you knew just what I was
.      Eb
 there for
.Cm   Fm              Bb7         Eb
      you heard me saying a prayer for
.Cm   Fm              Bb7         Eb
      someone I really could care for

.         Ab6          Bb7    Eb
 and then suddenly appeared before me
.    Ab6         Bb7             Eb
 the only one my arms could ever hold
.            Ab6           Db9     G/D
 I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"
.           Bb
 And when I looked the moon had
.F7        Fm7
 turned to gold

;Chorus

.Cm   Fm        Bb7        Eb
      without a love of my own
.Eb    Ab7    Eb</lyrics>

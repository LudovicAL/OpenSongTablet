.Bb        F                     C               G
 Maybe I'm amazed at the way you love me all the time
.Bb        F                   C        E
 Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you 
.Bb        F                       C                G
 Maybe I'm amazed athe the way you pulled me out of time
.    Bb           F
 And hung me on a line
.Ab                      G            C
 Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

;Chorus
.D           Dmaj7                 Ddim7
 Maybe I'm a man and maybe I'm a lonely man who's in the middle of something
.G                                 Dm7
 That he doesn't really understand 
.D           Dmaj7                      Ddim7
 Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me
.G                                Dm7
 Baby won't you help me understand

;Solo
;Chorus

.Bb        F                        C               G
 Maybe I'm amazed at the way you're with me all the time
.Bb        F                   C        Erun
 Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you
.Bb        F                     C               G
 Maybe I'm amazed at the way you help me sing my song
.    Bb                F
 You right me when I'm wrong
.Ab                      G            C
 Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you</lyrics>

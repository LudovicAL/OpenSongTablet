;        On this song, you can simulate that little guitar melody by starting
;        off with a plain jane E-chord, then playing an Esus4, and then stretch
;        your pinky down to the 4th fret of the D string to make that F# note.

 When I was young and full of grace
.     E
 and spirited a rattlesnake
.      E
 When I was young and fever fell
.     E
 My spirit I will not tell
.           A                  F#m
 You're on your honor not to tell

.     E
 I believe in coyotes and time as an abstract
.    E                                A
 Explain the change the difference between
.                   F#m                       B
 What you want and what you need there's the key
.                G#m
 Your adventure for today what do you do
.    A                      B
 Between the hours of the day

. E  Esus4  E  B      E  Esus4 E   B E

 s4e      my shBirt is wearing thF#min
.                    A
 And change is what I believe in

 When I was young and give and take
 And foolish said my fool awake
 When I was young and fever fell
 My spirit I will not tell
 You're on your honor on your honor

 Trust in your calling make sure your calling's true
 Think of others the others think of you
 Silly rule golden words make practice practice makes perfect
 Perfect is a fault and fault lines change

 I believe my humor's wearing thin
 And change is what I believe in

.C#m    A     C#m    A      C#  A    B
                                     

 I believe my shirt is wearing thin
 And change is what I believe in

 When I was young and full of grace
 And spirit hid a rattlesnake
 When I was young and fever fell
 My spirit I will not tell
 You're on your honor not to tell
. B
 I believe in example
. G#m
 I believe my throat hurts
.   A                           B
 Example is the checker to the key

 I believe my humor's wearing thin
 And I believe the holds are slipping

 I believe my shirt is wearing thin
 And change is what I believe in
;I Believe it ends on a C#m</lyrics>

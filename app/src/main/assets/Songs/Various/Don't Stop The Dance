.Am

.Em      Dm      Am
                 
.Em      Dm      Am
                 

. Em        Dm                Am
 Mama says truth is all that matters
. Em        Dm           Am
 Lying 'n deceiving is a sin
. Em                 Dm                    Am
 Drifting through a world that's torn and tattered
. Em              Dm                Am
 Every thought I have don't mean a thing

 Mama says love is all that matters
 Beauty should be deeper than your skin
 Living for the moment - lips and lashes
 Will I ever find my way again

 Mama says only stormy weather
 Don't know why there's no sun in the sky
 Footsteps in the dark come together
 Got to keep on moving or I'll die</lyrics>

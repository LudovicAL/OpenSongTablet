. C            G             F
 As I come of age, I keep fallin' down
.       Bb                 F
 And I feel just like a schoolboy
.       C              G
 I was in a senseless rage
.          F               Bb              F
 Running too hard, and I tore you all to pieces

;CHORUS:
. Am
 Yes but it's all over now
.     F
 And I'm a little bit older now
.       D
 The lessons that I'm learning now
.           G
 Are gonna make it easy (somehow)

. C           G       F
 Now again I try, starting over
.           Bb          F
 Put the pieces back together
. C         G            F
 Even as I cry, bitter tears
.       Bb              F
 I can see it's all a puzzle
.   Am               F  D  C
 A game, always the same, ooh ...

;CHORUS

 By the time I die, with the passing
 If I've sorted out my changes
 And if you could take the time
 I would tell you that it's still a puzzle
 The same, always a game, ooh

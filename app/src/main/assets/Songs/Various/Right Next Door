;INTRO
.A#
  (x4)

;VERSE 1
.Cm                                        Eb
 I can hear the couple fighting right next door
.      F                 Eb                  Cm
 Their angry words sound clear through these thin walls
.Cm                                            Eb
 Around midnight I heard 'im shout "Unfaithful one"
.F                         Eb            Cm
 And I knew right then the axe was gonna fall
.A#                A#             Cm                Cm
 It's because of me               It's because of me

;VERSE 2
 I heard him shout "Who is he", she mumbled low
 He said "Baby, don't you lie to me nomore"
 And I'm listening through these thin wall silent o' shame
 As she called out my name I was right next door
 It's because of me               It's because of me
 Because of me                    It's because of me

;CHORUS
[C
.G#                                  A#            Cm
 Oh, she was right next door and I'm such a strong persuader
.G#                   A#         Cm
 She was just another note on my guitar
.G#                   A#              Cm
 She's gonna lose the man that really loves her
.G#                   A#                  Cm
 In the silence I can hear their breaking hearts
[

;(SOLO)

;VERSE 3
 At daybreak I can hear him pack, say goodbye
 I can hear him slam the door and walk away
 Right next door I can hear that woman start to cry
 I should go to her, but what would I say
 It's because of me              It's because of me
 Because of me                   Young heart

;CHORUS (x2)

.Dm             Bb       F/A                 F
 Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long
.Dm           Bb       F/A                   C     G
 But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, but now I know
.          Bb             F
 She has a builtin ability
.Bb                     F
 To take everything she sees
.Bb                            C
 And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.

.    Fsus4            F Bb            C
 She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
.    Fsus4       F   Bb          C
 She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
.    Fsus4         F  Bb              C
 She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
.   Fsus4         F   Dm          C
 It takes control and slowly tears you apart.

 Well I don't really know her, I only know her name
 But she crawls under your skin, you're never quite the same, and now I know
 She's got something you just can't trust
 It's something mysterious
 And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.

 She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
 She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
 She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
 It takes control and slowly tears you apart.

 She don't like losing, to her it's still a game
 And though she will mess up your life,
 You'll want her just the same, and now I know
 She has a built in ability
 To take everything she sees
 And now it seems I've fallen, fallen for her.

.    Gsus4            G C             D
 She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
.    Gsus4       G   C           D
 She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart
.    Gsus4         G  C               D
 She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
.   Gsus4         G   Em          D
 It takes control and slowly tears you apart.

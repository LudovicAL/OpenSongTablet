.     D     A           D
 The first time ever I saw your face,
.               G             D   A7
 I thought the sun rose in your eyes.
.                      G              D
 And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
.        C                   D
 To the night and the empty sky, my love.
.        C                   D
 To the night and the empty sky.

 The first time ever I kissed your mouth,
 I felt the earth move in my hand,
 Like the trembling heart of a captive bird,
 That was there at my command, my love.
 That was there at my command.

 The first time ever I held you near,
 I felt the heart beat close to mine.
 I thought our joy would fill the world,
 And would last 'till the end of time, my love.
 And would last 'till the end of time.

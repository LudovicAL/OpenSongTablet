.Am                 F   G
 These mist covered mountains
.                   C  Gm
 Are a home now for me 
.                   Am Em
 But my home is the lowlands
.                F  G
 And always will be 
.                  Am   Em
 Some day you'll return to
.                      F     G
 Your valleys and your farms 
.                     Am
 And you'll no longer burn
.      Dm               G  Am   F  G
 To be brothers in arms            

.Am                       F      G
 Through these fields of destruction
.            C    Gm
 Baptisms of fire 
.                      Am   Em
 I've watched all your suffering
.                         F  G
 As the battles raged higher 
.                         Am    Em
 And though they did hurt me so bad
.                  F   G
 In the fear and alarm 
.              Am
 You did not desert me
.      Dm               G  Am   F  G
 To be brothers in arms            

.Am         G              Am     G
 There's so many different worlds 
.                  F    G
 So many different suns 
.(Am)        (G)       Am    G
 And we have  just one world 
.                         F    G   F(open)
 But we live in different ones     

.Am                    F    G
 Now the sun's gone to hell 
.                      C    Gm
 And the moon's riding high 
.               Am  Em
 Let me bid you farwell
.                 F   G
 Every man has to die 
.                        Am  Em
 But it's written in the starlight
.                       F    G
 And every line on your palm 
.                    Am
 We're fools to make war
.       Dm               G
 On our brothers in arms</lyrics>

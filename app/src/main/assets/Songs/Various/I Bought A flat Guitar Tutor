 I bought a flat
.Abdim                  E
 Diminished responsibility
.          D9              C
 You're de ninth person to see
.   Bsus   B           A7      Amaj7
 To be  suspended by a seventh major
.        E
 catastrophe
.       Am
 It`s a minor point but
.G
 Gee
.G+
 Augmented
.       G#+
 By the sharpness
 Of your
.C
 See what I'm going through
.A      B       E
 Eh, to be with you
.     Ab
 In a flat
.       C
 By the sea

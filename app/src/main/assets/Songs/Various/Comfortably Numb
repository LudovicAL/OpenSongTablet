.Bm                        A
  Hello, Is there any body in there?
.                    G        D/F# Em    Bm
 Just nod if you can hear me,  is there anyone at home?
.Bm                        A
 Come on now I hear you're feelin' down
.      G           D/F#  Em          Bm
 well, I can ease your pain, get you on your feet again.
.                        A                   G          D/F#   Em
 relax, I need some information, first,  just the basic facts, 
.         Bm
 Can you show me where it hurts

.D                           A        D                                A        G/B
 There is no pain you are receding,   A distant ships smoke, on the horizon,    
.C                               G       C                                               G
 You are only coming through in waves,   Your lips move, but I can't hear what your saying,
.     D                       A         D                             A       G/B
 When I was a child, I had a fever,   my hands felt just like, two ballons,   
.C                                   G   G                                 C
 Now I've got that feeling once again,   I can't explain, you would not understand,
.                        G
 This is not how I am,   
.A               G/B  C             G                D
 I______________________  have become, comforatbly numb.

.D     A     D     A  G/B      C     G     C     G
.     .     .     .           .     .     .     .

.Bm                      A                         G   D/F#  Em
 O.K., just a little pin prick, there'll be no more (scream),
.           Bm
 But you may feel a little sick.  Can you stand up?
.                   A                              G             D/F#  Em
 I do believe it's working, good. That'll keep you going throught the show,
.Bm
 C'mon it's time to go

.D                            A       D                               A       G/B
 There is no pain you are receding,   A distant ships smoke on the horizon,   
.C                                G          C                                         G
 You are only coming through in waves,   Your lips move, but I can't hear what your saying,
.    D                              A               D                        A     G/B
 When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse,   Out of the corner of my eye,   
.C                              G                                C
 I turned to look, but it was gone,   I can not put my finger on it now,
.                            G
 The child is grown, the dream is gone,
.A               G/B  C          G                 D
 and I___________________, have become comfortably numb.

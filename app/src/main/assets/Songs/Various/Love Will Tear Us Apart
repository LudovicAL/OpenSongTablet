.Em                           DDsus4 D Dmaj9
 When the routine bites hard     
.Em7-                   A
 And ambitions are low  
.Em                            DDsus4 D Dmaj9
 And the resentment rides high    
.Bm                     A
 But emotions won't grow
.Em                          DDsus4 D Dmaj9
 And we're changing our ways    
.Em7-                   A
 Taking different roads 
.     Em    D    Dsus4 D    Dmaj9 Bm    A
 Then love, love will  tear us    apart again (4x)

 Why is the bedroom so cold
 Turned away on your side?
 Is my timing that flawed,
 our respect run so dry?
 Yet there's still this appeal
 That we've kept through our lives
 Love, love will tear us apart again (4)

 Do you cry out in your sleep
 All my failings expose?
 Get a taste in my mouth
 As desperation takes hold
 Is it something so good
 Just can't function no more?
 When love, love will tear us apart again (4)</lyrics>

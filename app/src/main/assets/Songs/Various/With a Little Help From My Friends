;Capo 2nd fret

.  D            A            Em
 What would you do if I sang out of tune,
.                       A7          D
 would you stand up and walk out on me?
.             A             Em
 Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
.         A          A7          D
 and I'll try not to sing out of key.

 Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends.
.          C                  G            D
 Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
.              C                 G            D        A7
 Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends. (only 1st chorus)
[

 What do I do when my love is away,
 does it worry you to be alone?
 How do I feel by the end of the day,
 are you sad because you're on your own?

;Chorus
.       Bm7     E7        D        C       G
 Do you need anybody? - I need somebody to love.
.         Bm7   E7        D        C       G
 Could it be anybody? - I want somebody to love.

 Would you believe in a love at first sight?
 Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.
 What do you see when you turn out the light?
 I can't tell you but I know it's mine.

;Chorus

.       Bm7     E7        D        C       G
 Do you need anybody? - I need somebody to love.
.         Bm7   E7        D        C       G
 Could it be anybody? - I want somebody to love.

.          C                G            D
 Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends.
.              C                 G            D
 Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.
.D         C
 Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
.G                                 Bb   Gm6   D

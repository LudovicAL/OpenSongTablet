;Monty Python
;_The Meaning of Life_

;Verse I
.G    G7C
 Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
.C                                  G
 revolving at nine-hundred miles an hour
.G7
 and orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,
.                                    C
 a sun that is the source of all our power.
.C
 Now the sun and you and me, and all the stars that we can see
.A7                           F
 Are moving a million miles a day
.F7                               C
 In an outer spiral arm at forty thousand miles an hour
.G7                              C
 of the galaxy we call the Milky Way.

;Verse II
 Our galaxy itself contains a hundred million stars,
 it's a hundred thousand light-years side to side,
 it bulges in the middle, sixty thousand light-years thick,
 but out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
 We're thiry thousand light-years from galactic central point
 We go 'round every two hundred million years,
 and our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions in this
 Amazing and Expanding Universe!

;Verse III
 The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
 in all of the directions it can whiz,
 as fast as it can go, the speed of light, y'know,
 twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is,
 So remember when you're feeling very small and insecure
 How amazingly unlikely is your birth,
 And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space,
 'Cause there's bugger-all down here on Earth.</lyrics>

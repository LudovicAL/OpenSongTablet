 She said: "Come in stranger, it's good to have you home.
.C7 F                    C
 I hurried thru 'cause I knew it was you,
.      Dm        G7   C
 when I saw your dog, waggin' his tail.
.F                            C
 Honey, why didn't you let me know by mail?
.  D7                        G7
 You've been gone so long"   
.         C                                 F6           G7     C
 She said: "Come in stranger, I know you're weary from all your miles.
.C7   F                       C
 Just sit right there in your easy chair,
.    F6            G7      C
 and tell me all about the places you've been,
.    F                        C
 how long it'll be before you leave again.
.  D7                               G7
 I hope it's a long, long while."   
.         C         C              G7                   C
 She said: "Come in stranger, everything 'round home is fine.
.C7   F                           C
 I've watched and I've waited for you to get back,
.      G7                 C
 and I missed you all the time."

 2. She said: "Come in , stranger, Oh how I need you when you're gone.
 I walk the floor and I watch the door
 and when I lie awake and wonder where you can be,
 I'd give anything to have you here with me.
 I get so lonesome all alone."
 She said: "Come in, stranger, and won't you listen to my plea.
 Stay long enough, so that the one I love,
 Is not a stranger to me.</lyrics>

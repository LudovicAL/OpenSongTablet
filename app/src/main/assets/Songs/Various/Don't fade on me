.  A        C   D  A
 I remember you so clearly
.              C       D   A
 The first one through the door
.            C    D   A
 I return to find you drifting
.        C    D   A
 too far from the shore

 I remember feeling this way
 You can lose it without knowing
 You wake up and you don't notice
 which way the wind is blowing

.AFG     AFG    AFG
   Don't   fade   
.              A
 don't fade on me

 You were the one who made things different
 You were the one who took me in
 You were the one thing I could count on
 Above all you were my fried

;ref

 Well your clothes hang on a wire
 And the sun is over head
 But today you are too weary
 To even leave your bed

 Was it love that took you under
 or did you know too much
 Was it something you could picture
 But never could quite touch

.C                       Em   C                       Em
 Ground control to Major Tom, ground control to Major Tom:
.Am        Am7/G             D7
 Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
.C                       Em   C                             Em
 Ground control to Major Tom: commencing countdown engine's on
.Am      Am7/G          D7
 Check ignition and may God's love be with you

.C                               E7                          F
 This is ground control to Major Tom, you've really made the grade!
.        Fm             C/E                   F
 And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear, now it's
.Fm                C/E            F
 time to leave the capsule if you dare

.C                              E7                             F
 This is Major Tom to ground control, I'm stepping through the door
.        Fm              C/E           F           Fm
 And I'm floating in the most peculiar way and the stars look
.     C/E         F
 very difeerent today

.    Fmaj7     Em7                   Fmaj7         Em7
 For here am I sitting in a tin can, far above the world
.Bbmaj7          Am               G             F         C
 Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do        
.F         G         A            C         F         G

.C                                      E7                      F
 Though I'm passed one hundred thousand miles, I'm feeling very still
.      Fm                 C/E                F           Fm
 And I think my spaceship knows which way to go, tell my wife I
.         C/E           F
 love her very much she knows

.G                 E7              Am
 Ground control to Major Tom: Your circuit's dead, there's
.Am7/G
 something wong.
.        D7                         C/G                        G
 Can you hear me Major Tom? Can you hear me Major Tom? Can you hear
 me Major Tom? Can you ...

.Fmaj7     Em7                        Fmaj7         Em7
 Here am I floating round my tin can, far above the moon
.Bbmaj7          Am               G             F
 Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do
.C         F         G         A            C         F

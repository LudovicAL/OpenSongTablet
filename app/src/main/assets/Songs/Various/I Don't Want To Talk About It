.C     Dm
 I can tell by your eyes
.            G                       C
 That you've probably been crying forever
.        Dm
 And the stars in the sky
.           G                         C          C7
 Don't mean nothing, to you they're a mirror     

[C]
.F             G
 I don't wanna talk about it
.C       Em       Am       Am/G
 How you broke my heart    
.F                     G
 If I stay here just a little bit longer
.F                        G
 If I stay here won't you listen
.      Dm        G
 To my heart     
.      C
 Oh my heart
[]

.     Dm
 If I stand all alone
.         G                              C
 Will the shadows hide the colours of my heart
 Blue for the tears
 Black for the nights
.         Dm
 Well the stars in the sky
.           G                         C          C7
 Don't mean nothing, to you they're a mirror

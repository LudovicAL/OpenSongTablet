.F                  Cmaj7         F                        C
 Oh my love for the first time in my life my eyes are wide open
.F                   Cmaj7                 F  Am   G   C
 Oh my lover for the first time in my life my eyes can see

;Chorus
.Am                 E
 I see the wind, oh I see the trees
.F                          C
 Everything is  clear in my heart
.Am                   E
 I see the clouds, oh I see the sky
.Am                         C
 Everything is clear in our world

.F                  Cmaj7         F                       C
 Oh my love for the first time in my life my mind is wide open
.F                   Cmaj7                 F  Am   G   C
 Oh my lover for the first time in my life my mind can feel

;Chorus
.Am             E
 I feel joy, oh I feel dreams
.F                          C
 Everything is  clear in my heart
.Am              E
 I feel life, oh I feel love
.Am                         C
 Everything is clear in our world

.F                  Cmaj7         F                        C
 Oh my love for the first time in my life my eyes are wide open
.F                   Cmaj7                 F  Am   G   C
 Oh my lover for the first time in my life my eyes can see</lyrics>

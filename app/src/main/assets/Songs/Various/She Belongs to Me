[Intro] One measure each -- D D E G D

.D                                       G                       D
  she got everything she needs, she's an  artist, she don't look  back
.D-G-D

.D        G                                                      D
  she got  everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look  back
.D-G-D

.D                 E
  she can take the  dark out of the night time
.G                        D-G-D
  paint the daytime black 

 you'll start out standing, vow to steal her anything she sees
 you'll start out standing, vow to steal her anything she sees
 you'll wind up peeking through a keyhole, down upon your knees

 she never stumbles, got no place to fall
 she never stumbles, got no place to fall
 she's nobody's child, lord can't touch her at all

 she wears an egyptian ring, sparkles before she speaks
 she wears an egyptian ring, sparkles before she speaks
 she's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique

 bow down to her on sunday, salute her when her birthday comes
 bow down to her on sunday, salute her when her birthday comes
 for halloween give her a trumpet, for christmas, give her a drum

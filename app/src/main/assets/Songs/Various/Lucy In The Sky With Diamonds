.  A         A7        D         D/F
 Picture yourself in a boat on a river
.       A       A7         D        D/F        G
 With tangerine trees and marmalade skies      
.   A     A7             D            D/F
 Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
.  A             A7       D         Dm       C
 A girl with caleidoscope eyes.              

. Bb                   C                F                  Bb
 Cellophane flowers of yellow and green towering over your head.
.C                          G                         D
 Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone

;Chorus
.G           C        D
 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
.G           C        D
 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
.G           C        D
 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
.D      A
 Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.

 Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
 where rockinghorse-people eat marshmallow pies
 Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
 that grow so incredibly high

 Newspaper taxis appear on the shore waiting to take you away
 Climb in the back with your head in your hand and you're gone

;Chorus

 Picture yourself in a train in a station
 with plasticine porters with looking glass ties
 Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
 the girl with kaleidoscope eyes

;Repeat chorus till fade</lyrics>

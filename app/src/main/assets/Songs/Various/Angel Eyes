.C   A#   C                       A#      C
   Angel eyes - am I deceived or did you sigh?
.              A#             F         G#
 For all I know you let your love light 
.         C  G#      F       A#
 Shine on me                 

 Angel eyes - you never close, who's got the time?
 I can wait until your love light
 Shine on me

 Angel eyes - on the wing and open wide
 No matter now how high the moon
 Shine down on me</lyrics>

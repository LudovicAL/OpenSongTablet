. G
 Don't move, don't talk out of time, don't think,
.                                   C
 Don't worry everything's just fine, just fine
. G
 Don't grab, don't clutch, don't hope for too much
.                                                  C
 Don't breathe, don't achieve, don't grieve without leave
. Em
 Don't check just balance on the fence
 Don't answer, don't ask, don't try and make sense

 Don't whisper, don't talk, don't run if you can walk
 Don't cheat, compete, don't miss the one beat
 Don't travel by train, don't eat, don't spill
 Don't piss in the drain, don't make a will
 Don't fill out any forms, don't compensate
 Don't cower, don't crawl, don't come around late
 Don't hover at the gate

. Em
 Don't take it on board
 Don't fall on your sword
.                       C
 Just play another chord
 If you feel you're getting bored

. G
 Don't change your brand
 Don't listen to the band
 Don't gape
 Don't ape
.                    C
 Don't change your shape, have another grape
 Keyboard solo: D-C-D-C-Em-C
 Don't plead
 Don't bridle
 Don't shackle
 Don't grind
 Don't curve
 Don't swerve
 Don't lie, die, serve
 Don't theorize, realise, polarise,
 Chance, dance, dismiss, apologise
 Don't spy                               Gimme some more
 Don't lie                               Gimme some more
 Don't try                               Of that stuff love
 Imply                                   Gimme some more
 Detain                                  Too much is not enough
 Explain
 Start again                             I feel numb
 Don't triumph, don't coax, don't cling, don't hoax
 Don't freak, peak, don't leak, don't speak
 Don't project                           I feel numb
 Don't connect, protect, don't expect
 Suggest
 Don't project, don't connect
 Protect, don't expect, suggest
 Don't struggle                          I feel numb
 Don't jerk, don't collar, don't work
 Don't wish, don't fish, don't teach, don't reach
 Don't borrow, don't break, don't fence
 Don't steal, don't pass, don't press
 Don't try, don't feel
 Don't touch, don't dive, don't suffer
 Don't rhyme, don't fantasize, don't rise
 Don't lie
 Don't project, don't connect
 Protect, don't expect, suggest
 Don't project, don't connect
 Protect, don't expect, suggest</lyrics>

;Intro
.Em   C    D
           

 (Once upon a time, not so long ago ....)

.Em                             Em/F#
 Tommy used to work on the docks
.Em
 Union's been on strike. He's down on his luck
.     C      D    Em
 It's tough,   so tough.

 Gina work the dinner all day
 Working for her man. She brings home hre pay
 For love, for love.

;Bridge
.                      C    D                Em
 She says we've got to hold on to what we've got.
.C                 D                           Em
 It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not.
.       C        D                 Em        C
 We've got each other and that's a lot, for love.
.      D
 We'll give it a shot.

;Chorus
.Em  C                D      G     C           D7sus4
 Woooo, we're halfway there, wooo, livin' on a prayer.
.Em       C          D         G
 Take my hand we'll make it, I swear
.G  C  D7sus4
 Wooo, livin' on a prayer

 Tommy's got his six string in hock,
 now he's holding in, what he used to make it talk
 So though, it's so though.

 Gina dreams of running away
 When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers:
 Baby it's O.K., some day.

;Chorus

;Bridge

;Solo: Em, C, D, G, C, D ...

.Em                        C   D             EmD
 Oooooooooh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
.      C                           D
 You live for the fight when it's all that you've got.

.Bb   Eb        Fsus4     F
 Woooooo, we're half ---- way there
.Bb   Eb  F7sus4
 Woooooo, livin' on a prayer
.Gm      Eb             F         Gm
 Take my hand and we'll make it I swear
.Bb  Eb F7sus4
 Woooo, livin on a prayer</lyrics>

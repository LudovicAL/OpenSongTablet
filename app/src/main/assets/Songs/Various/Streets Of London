. G                D               Em          C
 Have you seen the old man in the closed down market,
. C               G               Am        D
 Kicking out the papers with his worn out shoes?
.G                D              Em             Bm
 In his eyes you see no pride.  Hanging loosely by his side,
. C           G             D           G
 Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news.

;Chorus

.Am7  C           G              D   Em
  So how can you tell me you're lonely,
.         Am                              D
 And you say for you that the sun don't shine?
. G              D                Em                    Bm
 Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London,
. C             G                 D                    G   Am7
 I'll show you something that'll make you change your mind.

 Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of London?
 Dirt in her hair and her clothes are all in rags.

 She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking,
 Carrying her home in two old shopping bags.

;Chorus

 In the all night cafe at a quarter to eleven,
 Same old man sitting there all alone.
 Looking at the world over the rim of his tea cup,
 Each tea lasts a hour, then he wanders home alone.

;Chorus

 Have you seen the old man outside the seamen's mission?
 Memory fading with the metal ribbons he wears.
 In this lonesome city the rain cries a little pity,
 For one more forgotten hero in a world that doesn't care.

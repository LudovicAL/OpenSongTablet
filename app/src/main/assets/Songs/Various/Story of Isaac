.    Am             F
 The door it opened slowly,
.   Am             F
 my father he came in,
.      G    F     E
 I was nine years old.
.       Am              F
 And he stood so tall above me,
.    Am                  F
 his blue eyes they were shining
.        G         F    E
 and his voice was very cold.
.   C
 He said, "I've had a vision
 and you know I'm strong and holy,
.       D                 B
 I must do what I've been told."
.      F              Bb
 So he started up the mountain,
.      F               Bb
 I was running, he was walking,
.        F       G       A    Am
 and his axe was made of gold.

 Well, the trees they got much smaller,
 the lake a lady's mirror,
 we stopped to drink some wine.
 Then he threw the bottle over.
 Broke a minute later
 and he put his hand on mine.
 Thought I saw an eagle
 but it might have been a vulture,
 I never could decide.
 Then my father built an altar,
 he looked once behind his shoulder,
 he knew I would not hide.

 You who build these altars now
 to sacrifice these children,
 you must not do it anymore.
 A scheme is not a vision
 and you never have been tempted
 by a demon or a god.
 You who stand above them now,
 your hatchets blunt and bloody,
 you were not there before,
 when I lay upon a mountain
 and my father's hand was trembling
 with the beauty of the word.

 And if you call me brother now,
 forgive me if I inquire,
 "Just according to whose plan?"
 When it all comes down to dust
 I will kill you if I must,
 I will help you if I can.
 When it all comes down to dust
 I will help you if I must,
 I will kill you if I can.
 And mercy on our uniform,
 man of peace or man of war,
 the peacock spreads his fan.</lyrics>

. C              Dm   G              F   C
 Morning has broken, like the first morning,
.               Em Am   D              G
 Blackbird has spoken, Like the first bird.
. C              F        C              Am D
 Praise for the singing, Praise for the morning,
. G               C    F     G7             C      CFGEAm F G C
 Praise for them springing, Fresh from the world.         

. C                      Dm    G             F  C
 Sweet's the rain's new fall, sunlight from heaven,
.                Em Am    D            G
 Like the first dewfall, on the first grass.
. C              F          C          Am D
 Praise for the sweetness, of the wet garden,
. G             C   F     G7             C     CFGEAm F G C
 Sprung in completeness, where his feet pass.         

. C               Dm    G           F  C
 Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning,
.             Em  Am     D        G
 Born of the one light, Eden saw play.
. C             F      C            Am D
 Praise with elation, praise every morning,
. G          C F    G7         C    CFGEAm F G C
 God's recreation, of the new day.         

. C              Dm   G              F   C
 Morning has broken, like the first morning,
.               Em Am   D              G
 Blackbird has spoken, Like the first bird.
. C              F        C              Am D
 Praise for the singing, Praise for the morning,
. G               C    F     G7             C      CFGEAm F G C
 Praise for them springing, Fresh from the world.</lyrics>

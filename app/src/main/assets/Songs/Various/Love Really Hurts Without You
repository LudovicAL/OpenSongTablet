 Love really hurts without you: Billy Ocean
 
.G                                                       D
 You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy.
.                   Am
 You're given it to some other guy, who gives you the eye. 
.    Em                   D
 You don't give nothin to me. 
.G                                                   D
 You painted a smile, And you dress all the while to excite me. 
.                          Am
 But don't you know you're turning me on, I know that it's wrong. 
.    Em                D
 But I can't stop this pain inside me. 
 
 Chorus.
.G                               D
 Baby, love really hurts without you. 
.                          Am
 Love really hurts without you. 
.         C
 And it's breaking my heart, 
.    Em         D
 But what can I do. 
.G                              D
 Baby Love really hurts without you. 
.                              Am
 Love really hurts through and through. 
.         C
 And it's breaking my heart, 
.    Em         D          G
 But what can I do without you. 
 
.G                                                           D
 You walk like a dream and you make like you're Queen of the action. 
.                   Am
 You're using ev'ry trick in the book, the way that you look. 
.       Em                  D
 You're really something to see. 
.G                                                  D
 You cheat and you lie, To impress any guy that you fancy. 
.                       Am
 But don't you know I'm out of my mind, So give me a sign. 
.    Em               D
 And help to ease the pain inside me. 
 
 Chorus

 But what can I do.

 Baby Love really hurts without you. 
.                              Bm

;Intro
.C  Am7  Dm7  G7sus
 -------------------

.C                      Am7
 Got a wife and kids in Baltimore Jack
.Dm7                       G7sus
 I went out for a ride and I never went back
.C                       Am7
 Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
.Dm7                       G7sus
 I took a wrong turn and I just kept going

[C]
.C                 Am7
 Everybody's got a hungry heart
.Dm7               G7sus
 Everybody's got a hungry heart
.C                           Am7
 Lay down your money and you play your part
.Dm7               G7sus
 Everybody's got a huh-uh-un-gry heart
[]

.C              Am7
 I met her in a Kingstown bar
.Dm7                    G7sus
 We fell in love I knew it had to end
.C                          Am7
 We took what we had and we ripped it apart
.Dm7                G7sus
 Now here I am down in Kingstown again

;Chorus

;Solo
.Eb    Cm7   Fm7   Ab/Bb   Eb   Cm7   Fm7   G7sus
 -----------------------------------------------
 ---

.C                 Am7
 Everybody needs a place to rest
.Dm7                G7sus
 Everybody wants to have a home
.C                             Am7
 Don't make no difference what nobody says
.Dm7                  G7sus
 Ain't nobody like to be alone

 There are only 3 chords in this song: Bmsus, Em, and A.
 I'm not exactly sure of the name of the Bmsus chord.  These
 chords repeat throughout the song.  The strumming pattern
 is left as a exercise for the reader.

;Detune 1/2 step i.e to Eb
.BmsusEm   A
           

 I know a girl, a girl called Party, Party Girl
 I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl
 And she won't tell me her name
 Oh no, not me

 I know a boy, a boy called Brash, Brash Ham
 I know he does all that he can
 Wham bam
 And she won't tell me his name
 Oh no, not me

 When I was young, I thought the world revolved around me
 I was wrong
 And so I sing along
 And if you dance then dance with me

 I know a girl, a girl called Party, Party Girl
 I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl
 I know a boy, a boy called Trampoline
 You know what I mean
 I think I know what he wants
 I think I know what he wants
 I think I know what she wants
 I think I know what she wants
 I think I know what he wants
 I think I know what he wants

 Well, thank you!</lyrics>

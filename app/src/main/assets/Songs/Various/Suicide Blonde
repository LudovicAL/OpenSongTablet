 (Don't you know what you're doing - You've got a death wish)

.E       G     A E G A
 Suicide blonde      
 Suicide blonde
 Suicide blonde
 Suicide blonde

.E             G A      E                 G A
 Suicide blonde was the color of her hair   
.       E          G     A      E          G A
 Like a cheap distraction for a new affair   
 She knew it would finish before it began
 Wow baby I think you lost the plan

;chorus
[C
.E           G    A   E       G     A
 You want to make her suicide blonde
 Love devastation suicide blonde
 You want to make her suicide blonde
 Love devastation suicide blonde
[

 She stripped to the beat but her clothes stay on
 White light everywhere but you can't see a thing
 Such a squeeze - A mad sad moment
 Glory to you - Glory to you
 Take me there - Take me there

;harmonica solo

 Got some revelation - Put into your hands
 Save you from your misery like rain across the land
 Don't you see the color of deception
 Turning your world around again

;chorus

 (That's the story - Everything you wanna be, everything you are)

;gitaarsolo

 You wanna make - you wanna make
 You wanna make her - suicide blonde
 You wanna make - (stop)

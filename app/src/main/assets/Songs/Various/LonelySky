.G
 That cold North wind they call La Bize
.     Em
 Is swirling 'round about my knees
.C                                       D
 Trees are crying leaves into the river  
.        G
 I'm huddled in this French cafe
.    Em
 I never thought I'd see the day
.       C                              D
 When winter's here and summer's nearly over

.          C                             D
 Even the birds have packed up and gone  
.                G                  C
 They're flying south with this song
.        G                 C
 And my love, she too has gone
.            D
 She had to fly, take care

;Chorus :
.              G
 It's such a lonely sky
.  Em                                    Am
 They'll trap your wings, my love, and hold your flight
.  D                                  G
 They'll build a cage and steal your only sky
. Em                                Am
 Fly away, fly to me, fly when the wind is high
.       D                                D
 I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky

 The old cathedral lights are low
 She and I we'd often go
 To admire and sometimes kneel in prayer
 Lords and ladies lying in stone
 Hand in hand from long ago
 Though their hands are cold, their love's forever

 Even the choir rehearses those songs
 For Christmas is not long
 And my love, she too has gone
 She had to fly, out there

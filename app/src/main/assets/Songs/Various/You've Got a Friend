.            Am         E7              Am
 When you're down and troubled, and you need some loving care,
.    Dm7      G7               C   E7
 And nothing, nothing is going right.
.Am                  E7               Am
 Close your eyes and think of me, and soon I will be there,
.    Dm7         Em               Dm7   G7
 To brighten up even your darkest night.

;Chorus

.         C                          F
 You just call out my name, and you know where I am,
.          C                  G7sus  G
 I'll come running to see you again. 
. C                              F                     Am7   G
 Winter, spring, summer or fall, all you have to do is call, 
.         F  Em  Dm7 G7                       C
 And I'll be there, yes I will, you've got a friend.

 If the sky above you grows dark and full of clouds,
 And that old north wind begins to blow.
 Keep your head together, and call my name out loud,
 Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door.

;Chorus

.    Bb                         F
 Now ain't it good to know that you've got a friend,
.     C
 When people can be so cold.
.        F                   Bb9
 They'll hurt you, yes and desert you,
.    Am7                   D7                      G7sus  G7
 And take your soul if you let them, Oh, but don't let them.

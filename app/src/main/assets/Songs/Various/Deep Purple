;(b-side to the single "Never Before", 1972)

.Bm
 If you're leaving, close the door.
.A                        Bm
 I'm not expecting people anymore.
.Bm
 Hear me greaving, lying on the floor.
.A7                          Bm
 Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.

.Bm              D
 I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man.
.G               Em
 And my world is pale.
.Bm
 When a blind man cries,
.D             G                     Bm
 Lord you know there ain't no sadder tale.

.Bm
 Had a friend once, in a room.
.A
 Had a good time, but it ended much to soon.
.Bm
 In a cold month, in that room.
.A7                     Bm
 Found a reason for the things we had to do.

.Bm              D
 I'm a blind, I'm a blind man.
.G               Em
 Now my world is cold.
.Bm
 When a blind man cries,
.D                G                 Bm
 Lord you know he feels it from his soul</lyrics>

.     C      Em         Am       C
 It's nine o'clock on a saturday 
.    F       C/E            D7 G
 the regular crowd shuffles in 
.           C       Em       Am         C/G
 There's an old man  sitting next to me 
.       F           G11       C   F/C Cmaj7 G11
 Makin' love to his tonic and gin   
.         C           Em        Am    C/G
 He says "Son can you play me a memory ?
.    F          C/E         D7   G
 I'm not really sure how it goes 
.         C            Em          Am         C/G
 But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
.     F        G11           C
 when I wore a younger man's clothes"

[C
.Am      Am/G   D7/F# F Am
 Da da da de de da  
.      Am/G   D7/F# D7 G G/F C/E G7/D
 da da  de de  da da da  
.C         Em/B             Am         C/G
 Sing us a song, you're the piano man, 
.F         C/E    D7    G
 sing us a song tonight 
.           C          Em/B       Am
 Well we're all in the mood for a melody
.C/G F             G11         C    F/C Cmaj7 G11
 and you've got us feeling all right

.    C           Em       Am              C
 Now John at the bar is a friend of mine, 
.   F          C/E        D7   G
 he gets me my drinks for free 
.         C            Em         Am            C/G
 And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke,
.            F               G11         C  F/C Cmaj7 G11
 but there's some place that he'd rather be   
.         C        Em            Am         C/G
 He says "Bill I believe this is killing me"
.     F          C/E          D7   G
 As a smile ran away from his face 
.          C           Em         Am    C/G
 "Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
.   F           G11         C
 If I could get out of this place"

;Chorus

.    C         Em          Am       C
 Now Paul is a real estate novelist 
.    F         C/E        D7   G
 who never had time for a wife 
.         C            Em          Am           C/G
 And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy,
.    F        G11         C    F/C Cmaj7 G11
 and probably will be for life   
.        C           Em         Am
 And the waitress is practicing politics,
.C/G     F           C/E        D7     G
  as the businessmen slowly get stoned 
.            C         Em              Am    C/G
 Yes they're sharing a drink they call loneliness,
.         F           G11       C
 but it's better than drinking alone

;Chorus

.       C           Em          Am       C
 It's a pretty good crowd for a saturday 
.        F       C/E        D7    G
 and the manager gives me a smile 
.          C               Em                   Am        C/G
 `Cause he knows that it's me that they've been coming to see
.      F         G11        C     F/C Cmaj7 G11
 To forget about life for a while   
.        C     Em            Am      C/G
 And the piano sounds like a carnival
.        F          C/E           D7   G
 and the microphone smells like a beer 
.         C          Em          Am          C/G
 And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
.         F            G11       C
 and say "Man what are you doing here ?"</lyrics>

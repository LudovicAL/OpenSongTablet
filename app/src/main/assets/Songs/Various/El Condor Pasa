;English lyric by Paul Simon

.    Em                         G
 I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
.                                  Em
 Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
 Hmm
.                              G
 I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
.                                       Em
 Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would
 Hmm

. C
 Away, I'd rather sail away
.       G
 Like a swan that's here and gone
.  C
 A man gets tied up to the ground
.             G
 He gives the world its saddest sound
.            Em
 Its saddest sound

.                              G
 I'd rather be a forest than a street
.                                  Em
 Yes I would, if I could, I surely would
.                                     G
 I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
.                                       Em      C  G  C  G  Em
 Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would</lyrics>

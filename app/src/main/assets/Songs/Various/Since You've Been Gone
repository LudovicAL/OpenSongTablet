.G         D/F#            Em        D
 I get the same old dreams same time every night
.C           G/B          A    D
 Fall to the ground and I wake up
.G        D/F#           Em              D
 So I get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head
.C              G/B         A     D
 thoughts slide back to the break-up
.Eb                           F
 These four walls are closing in
.Eb                      F/A Cm7D
 Look at the mess you've put me in

;Chorus
.G                 D    Em                C
 Since you've been gone since you've been gone
.G             D    Em         C    D
 I'm out of my head can't take it   
.G          D         Em                C
 Could I be wrong But since you've been gone
.G          D        Em    C    D
 You cast a spell so break it   
.G  D    EmC    G D   Em C         D
 Ohh___  Oh___  Oh___ Since you've been gone

 So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light
 I read the words that you sent to me
 I can take the afternoon but nighttime comes around to soon
 You can't know what youy mean to me
 Your poison letters your telegram
 Just goes to show you don't give a damn

;Chorus

;Chorus in A</lyrics>

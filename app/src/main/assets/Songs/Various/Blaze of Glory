.Dm                              C
 I wake up in the morning, and I raise my weary head
.            G                              Dm             Dm7     Dm
 I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
.  F                                C
 I don't know where I'm going, only God knows where I've been
.      G                                    Dm
 I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind.

 When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
 well at least they gave me something, I didn't have to steal or have to win.
 Well they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man,
 I'm a colt in your stable I'm what Cain was to Abel, mister, catch me if you can.

.          G                  D
 I'm going down in a blaze of glory
.        G                D
 take me now but know the truth
.          G                 D
 I'm going out in a blaze of glory
.       C
 Lord I never drew first but I drew first blood
.    G                          Dm
 I'm no one's son call me young gun.

 You ask about my conscience, and I offer you my soul
 you ask if I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
 you ask me if I've known love, and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
 well, I've seen love come and I've seen it shot down I've seen it die in vain.

 Shot down in a blaze of glory
 take me now but know the truth
 I'm going out in a blaze of glory
 Lord I never drew first
 but I drew first blood
 I'm no one's son call me young gun.

 Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
 no I ain't looking for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
 Lord, I got to ask a favor, and I hope you'll understand
 'cos I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
 staring down a bullet, let me make my final stand.

 Shot down in a blaze of glory
 take me now but know the truth
 I'm going out in a blaze of glory
 Lord I never drew first
 but I drew first blood
 and I'm no one's son call me young gun,
 I'm a young gun.</lyrics>

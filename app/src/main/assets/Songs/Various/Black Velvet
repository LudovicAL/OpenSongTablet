;Sung by Alannah Myles
; You really should play this with a bass-player
; the guitar only plays fills and the solo
; They also detuned their instruments to Eb I think

.Em
 Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
 Jimmy Rogers on the Victr'la up high
 mama's dancing with baby on her shoulder
 the sun is setting like molasses in the sky

.Bsus          B                Asus  A
 The boy could sing knew how to move   everything
.Gsus     G            Dsus              D
   always wanting more    he'd leave you longing for

.Am7                   D
 Black velvet and that little boy smile
.Am7                   F             C
 black velvet and that slow southern style
.Am7                    D
 A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
.C7       C6         Em
 black velvet if you please

 Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
 "White lightning" bound to drive you wild
 Mama's baby is in the heart of every schoolgirl
 "Love me tender" leaves them cryin' in the aisle

 The way he moved it was so, so sweet and true
 Always wanting more he'd leave you longing for

 Black velvet and that little boy smile
 black velvet and that slow southern style
 A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
 black velvet if you please

 Every word and ev'ry song that he sang was for you
 In a flash he was gone it happened so soon
 What could you do?

;Solo

 Black velvet and that little boy smile
 black velvet and that slow southern style
 A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
 black velvet if you please</lyrics>

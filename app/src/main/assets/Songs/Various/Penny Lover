.G                       Em
 The first time I saw you
. Am                   D
 Oh, you looked so fine
.  G               Em
 And I had a feeling
. Am    D
 One day you'd be mine
.        G                    Em
 Honey, you came along and captured my heart
.        Am                              D
 Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
.                Am                     D
 When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
.         Am                             D
 Girl, a love like yours is hard to resist

. G                              D Em
 Penny lover, my love's on fire    
.                                D G
 Penny lover, you're my one desire 
.                                D Em
 Tell me baby, could this be true  
.                                        D G
 That I could need someone like I need you 

.                    Em
 Nights, warm and tender
. Am             D
 Lying next to you
.  G             Em
 Girl, I surrender
. Am             D
 What more can I do
.          G                 Em
 I spent all of my life in search of your love
.        Am                        D
 Now there's one thing I want to say
.        Am                            D
 Don't you ever take your sweet love away
.           Am                           D  G
 Girl, I'll do anything just please stay    

. C          D
 I don't understand it
.            G         D  G
 Oh, what's come over me  
.C                     D
 But I'm not gonna worry
.           G      D  G
 Oh, not anymore      
.             Em
 'Cos when a man's in love
.                     D  Em
 He's only got one story 
.                Am                              D
 That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
.           Am                            D
 When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
.          Am                            D
 With a love like yours it's hard to resist

. G                              D Em
 Penny lover, don't you walk on by 
.                                D G
 Penny lover, don't you make me cry

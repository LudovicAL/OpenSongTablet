;Intro:
.Dm      Em      Dm      C       Dm      C      Dm      Em
                                                        
.Dm      Em      Dm      C       Dm      C      Dm      Em
                                                        

;1:
.Dm                                        Bb
 There's a Spanish train that runs between Quadelquidir and old Seville
.       C                                          A7                 Dm
 and at dead of night the whistle blows and people hear she's running still.
.              Dm
 And then they hush their children back to sleep,
.Bb
 lock the doors upstairs they creep,
.    C                                                 A7                  Dm
 for it is said that the souls of the dead fill up the train, ten thousand deep.

;2:
.       Dm                             Bb     C      Dm
 Well a railway-man lay dying with his people by his side.
.                                Bb               A7
 His family were crying knelt in prayer before he died,
.      Bb                 C
 But above his head just waiting for the dead
.         A7                         Dm
 was the devil with a twinkle in his eye,
.      Bb                     C                          Dm
 Well, God's not around look what I've found? This one's mine!
.                                          Bb      C        Dm
 Just then the Lord himself appeared in a burning flash of light.
.                                    Bb       A7
 And shouted at the devil, get thee hence to endless night.
.         Bb                           C
 But the devil just grinned and said I may have sinned
.            Am                 Dm
 but there's no need to push me around,
.  Bb                        C
 I got here first so you can do your worst,
.                  Dm
 he's going under ground.

.       Dm                                         Bb   C       Dm
 Well I think I give you one more chance said the devil  with a smile,
.    Dm                                 Bb              A7
 so throw away that stupid lance. It's really not your style.
. Bb                 C                       A7                      Bb
 Joker is the name, poker is the game, we'll play right here on this bed.
.    Bb                      C                                     Dm
 And then we'll bet for the biggest stakes yet - the souls of the dead.

;3:
.             Bb       C              Dm
 And I said, look out Lord he's gonna win!
.    Bb                  C              Dm
 The sun is down and the night's riding in.
.     Bb               A7         Dm               Gm
 The train is dead on time, many souls are on the line,
.    Bb         A7   Dm
 oh Lord, he's gonna win.

;2:

 Now the railway-man he cut the cards and he dealt such a hand of five.
 And for the Lord he was praying hard for that train he'd have to drive,
 Well, the devil he had three aces and a king
 and the Lord he was running for a straight he had
 the queen and the knave and the ten of spades all he needed was the eight,
 and then the Lord, he called for one more card but he drew the diamond eight.
 And the devil said to the Son of God, 'I believe you got it straight,
 so deal me one for the time has come to see who'll be the king of this place',
 But as he spoke from beneath his cloak he slipped another ace.
 The thousand souls was the opening bid, but soon went up to fifty-nine,
 but the Lord didn't see what the devil did and he said, 'that suits me fine.'
 I'll raise you high to hundred-five and forever put an end to your sin.
 But the devil let out a mighty shout: 'my hand wins'.

;3:

 And i said, Lord oh, Lord you let him win. The sun is down and the night's riding in.
 The train is dead on time, many souls are on the line, oh Lord, he's gonna win.

;1:

 There's a Spanish train that runs between Quadelquidir and old Seville
 and at dead of night the whistle blows and people hear she's running still.
 And far away in some recess the Lord and the devil are now playing chess.
 The devil still cheats and wins more souls and as for the Lord, well,
 he's just doing his best,

;3:

 And i said, Lord oh, Lord you've gotta win. The sun is down and the night's riding in.
.                                                           Bb    C            Dm
 The train is still on time, oh my soul is on the line, oh Lord, you've got to win.</lyrics>

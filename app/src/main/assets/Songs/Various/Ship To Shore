.Eb      Bb            Ab         Eb         Ab      Bb      Eb Bb
 Ship to shore, do you read me anymore? This line is bad and fading.
.Eb      Bb     Ab        Eb    Ab        Bb        Ab/C      Bb/D     Ebsus4   Eb
 Ship to shore, answer my call. Send me a signal, a beacon to bring me home.    
.Ebsus4       Eb      Ebsus4       Eb     Bbsus4         Bb          Ab

.Cm             Fm             Db               Cm
 I have been to see the world. Tasted life at every turn.
.    Fm                   Bb                    Cm      Fm       Bb
 And all that time your face came back to haunt me.              
.Cm             Gm               Fm                Cm
 Day by day the feeling grew I know I'm still in love with you,
.       Fm          Cm                 Bb
 the farther that I go the more I know it.
 I want to show you

;Chorus

 Moving fast, all systems go, You and I had time to grow.
 Before there was a breakdown in transmission.
 How I wish that we could turn the clock back to the time when we
 were lovers in the true sense of the meaning.
 You must believe me.

;Chorus, but instead of 'fading' sing 'drowning'.

.Eb        Bb      Ab     Eb      Eb      Bb       Ab        Bb
 Ship to shore.                                              
.Eb        Bb      Ab     Eb      Eb      Bb       Ab        Bb
 Ship to shore.                                              
.Eb        Bb      Ab     Eb      Eb        Bb     Ab        Bb
 Ship to shore.                   Ship to shore              
.Eb        Bb      Ab     Eb      Eb        Bb     Ab        Bb
 Ship to shore.                   Ship to shore              
.Eb      Bb       Ab   Eb          Eb     Bb          Ab     Bb
 I cannot believe my eyes, but I think I see the light.      
.Eb     Bb    Ab    Eb         Eb   Bb        Ab       Bb
 You are everything I always wanted in my life.</lyrics>

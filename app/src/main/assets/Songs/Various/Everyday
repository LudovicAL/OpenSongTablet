;Hardin/Petty
 Everyday, it's a gettin' closer,
 Goin' faster than a roller coaster,
 Love like yours will surely come my way, (hey, hey, hey)

.  D        G             A7   G
 Everyday, it's a gettin' faster,
.  D           G             D   A7
 Everyone says go ahead and ask her,
. D                    G      A7      D     G    D
 Love like yours will surely come my way, (hey, hey, hey)

.  G
 Everyday seems a little longer,
.  C
 Every way, love's a little stronger,
. F
 Come what may, do you ever long for
. Bb            A  A7
 True love from me?

.  D        G             A7   G
 Everyday, it's a gettin' closer,
. D             G            D    A7
 Goin' faster than a roller coaster,
. D                    G      A7      D     G    D    A7
 Love like yours will surely come my way, (hey, hey, hey)

.  D        G             A7   G
 Everyday, it's a gettin' faster,
.  D           G             D   A7
 Everyone says go ahead and ask her,
. D                    G      A7      D     G    D
 Love like yours will surely come my way, (hey, hey, hey)

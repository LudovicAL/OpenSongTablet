.G
 Don't wish it away
.Em                      F         C F C F C F
 Don't look at it like it's forever
.C                 G
 Between you and me
.                  Bm        F                     C F C F C F
 I could honestly say that things can only get better
.     C         G    B7                    Em
 And while I'm away bust out the demons inside  G7
.                 C                      G
 And it won't be long before you and me run
.                       Am    F         GAm7 G7
 To the place in our hearts where we hide

;Chorus :
.        C                    G              F
 And I guess that's why they call it the blues
.             C               G              F
 Time on my hands could be time spent with you
.C                   G
 Laughing like children
.                Am
 Living like lovers
.C                F                D
 Rolling like thunder, under the covers
.F                           G                C Em F
 And I guess that's why they call it the blues

;Verse 2
 Just stare into space
 Picture my face in your hands
 Live for each second
 Without hesitation, never forget I'm your man
 Wait on me girl, cry in the night if it helps
 But more than ever I simply love you
 More than I love life itself</lyrics>

[Intro]                   

.     Dm             C
 The taxman's taken all my dough
.     F              C
 And left me in my stately home
.A     A/G   A/F   A/E   Dm
 Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
 And I can't sail my yacht
 He's taken everything I've got
 All I've got's this sunny afternoon

.D7                                     G7
 Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
.            C7                       F A7
 I got a big fat mama tryin' to break me
.      Dm                G7
 And I love to live so pleasantly
. D7               G7  C7
 Live this life of luxury
.F            A7        Dm  Dm/C Dm/B Dm/Bb
 Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
.        A    A/G A/F A/E
 In the summertime

 My girlfriend's run off with my car
 And gone back to her ma and pa
 Tellin' tales of drunkenness and cruelty
 Now I'm sittin' here
 Sippin' at my ice-cooled beer
 All I've got's this sunny afternoon

 Help me, help me, help me sail away
 Or give me two good reasons why I oughta stay
 'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
 Live this life of luxury
 Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
 In the summertime</lyrics>

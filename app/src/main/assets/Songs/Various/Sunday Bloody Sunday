.Bm        D                G
 I can't believe the news today
.Bm      D                 G
 I can't close my eyes and make it go away
.D        Em7
 How long how long must we sing this song
.D        Em7
 how long tonight
.  Bm   D   G                  Bm   D  G
 Tonight    We can be as one tonight   
.Bm     D             G
 Broken bottles under children's feet
.Bm     D               G
 Bodies strewn across a dead end street
.Bm          D               G
 But I won't heed the battle call
.Bm         D               G
 It puts my back up puts my back up against the wall
.Bm     D         G
 Sunday bloody sunday
.Bm     D         G
 Sunday bloody sunday
.F      Em        D   F    Em   D       F    Em   D
 Sunday bloody sunday                             

 And the battle's just begun
 theres many lost but tell me who has won?
 The trenches dug within our hearts
 and mothers children, brothers sisters torn apart
 Sunday bloody sunday
 Sunday bloody sunday

.D        Em7
 How long how long must we sing this song
.D          Em7
 How long tonight
.  Bm   D  G                  Bm   D    G    A
 Tonight   we can be as one tonight          
.  Bm   D  G       Bm   D  G
 tonight tonight tonight tonight
.Bm D  G         B         DG         B         D
       Wipe your tears away wipe your tears away
.Bm     D         G
 Sunday bloody sunday
.Bm     D         G
 Sunday bloody sunday
.F      Em        D    F    Em   D       Bm   D    G
 Sunday bloody sunday                              
.F      Em        D    F    Em   D       Bm   D    G
 Sunday bloody sunday                              

 And it's true we are immune
 When fact is fiction and TV is reality
 And today the millions cry
 We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
 Sunday bloody sunday
 Sunday bloody sunday
 Sunday bloody sunday

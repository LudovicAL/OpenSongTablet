;Intro
.Am    E     F     C     E
                         
.    Am           E            F           C    E
 You left my ring by the soap, now is that love?
.    Am               E                F           C    E
 You cleaned me out I could say broke, now is that love?
.    Am                        G        Bb                  F        E       A
 The better, better, better it gets the more these girls forget that that is love

.    A                     E               F        G
 You won't get dressed you walk about, now is that, is that?
.    A               E                F        G
 The teasing glances push me out, now is that, is that
.    C                            Am       F            E                   A
 The tougher, tougher, tougher it gets the more my lips repent that that is love

;Bridge
.Am                   G             D        E
 Beat me up with your letters, your walk-out notes
.Am                  G        D             E
 Funny how you still fight me right here at home
.A    E                  A E             A    E                  D   D    D   E
 Legs up with a book and a drink, now is that love that's making you think    

.    Am                  G           F           C    E
 You called my bluff I'm not so hot, now is that love?
.   A                  E                       F        G
 My assets froze while yours have dropped, now is that, is that
.       C                      Am       F               E                 A
 It's a cupid, cupid, cupid disguise to more or less survive, now that is love

;Break
.Am    Em    F     C     E     Am    Em    F     C     E       Am    G      Bb   F     E     A
                                                                                             

;Bridge

.     Am              G                 F        G
 I've made my bed the finger points now is that, is that love
.    C                                 Am       F              E                  A
 The more you, more you, more you cool down the easier love is found, now that is love</lyrics>

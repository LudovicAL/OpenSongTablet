 |F   C   |F   Bb  |Bb  F   |C       |   x2   (fiddle)
 |C       |Em      |F       |C   G   |   x2   (fiddle and banjo)

.C                Em
 Poor old Johnny Ray
.        F                          C                 G
 Sounded sad upon the radio moved a million hearts in mono
.C
  Our mothers cried
.F           F               C G
 Sang along, who'd blame them
.C                               Em
 You're grown (you're grown up), so grown (so grown up)
.F                             C        G
 Now I must say more than ever            (come on Eileen)
.C           Em            F
 Toora-loora-toora-loo-rye-aye
.           C                  G
 and we can sing just like our fathers

;Chorus
.D                    F#m
 Come on Eileen oh, I swear (well he means)
.        Em              G      A
 at this moment you mean everything
.     D                     F#m
 With you in that dress, my thoughts (I confess)
.         Em             G     A
 verge on dirty, Ah come on Eileen

 |A       |A       |   (banjo)
 |C       |Em      |F       |C   G   |    (fiddle and banjo)

.C                  Em
 These people round here
.            F
 wear beaten-down eyes sunk in smoke-dried faces,
.      C                    G
 so resigned to what their fate is
.    C                    Em
 but not us (no never) no not us (no never)
.F                                C       G
 we are far too young and clever             remember
.C           Em            F
 Toora-loora-toora-loo-rye-aye
.            C                 G
 Eileen I'll hum this tune for ever

.D                    F#m
 Come on Eileen, oh I swear (well he means)
.        Em                G     A
 Ah come on let's take off everything
.     D                   F#m
 That pretty red dress, Eileen (tell him yes)
.        Em                G    A
 Ah come on let's, ah come on Eileen
.     D                   F#m
 That pretty red dress, Eileen (tell him yes)
.        Em                G     A
 Ah come on let's, ah come on Eileen
.D
 Please...

;Half-speed, getting gradually faster
.D                            F#m
  (Come on Eileen too-loo rye-aye come on)
;Backing vocals sing "Eileen too-loo rye-ay toora toora-too-loora" repeatedly
.G                                      D      A
 Now you have grown, now you have shown, oh Eileen
.D                                     F#m
 Come on Eileen, these things they are real and I know
.                   G
 how you feel       Now I must say more than ever
.D                       A
  things round here have changed
.D             F#m            G  D A
 Too-ra loo-ra too-ra loo-rye-aye</lyrics>

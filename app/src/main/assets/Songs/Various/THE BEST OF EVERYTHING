.C                        G
   She prob'ly works in a restaurant
.C                 G
   That's what her momma did
.D
   But I don't know if she ever really
.          G
 Could put up with it.
.C                         G
   Or maybe she sings in a nightclub
.C                              G
  'Cause sometimes she used to sing
.D
   But I don't know if it ever
.               G        G7
 Amounted to anything.   
 But listen honey,
.C              G
   Wherever you are tonight,
.C                G                  D
   I wish you the best of everything,  in the world
.               Em
 And I hope you found
.D                 G
 Whatever you were looking for.

 instrum: C Am C Am D D D7 D7  G

 Yeah and it's over before you know it
 It all goes by so fast
 Yeah, the bad nights last forever
 And the good nights don't ever seem to last
 And man, we never had the real thing,
 But sometimes we used to kiss
 Back when we didn't understand,
 What we were caught up in.

 Wherever you are tonight,
 I wish you the best of everything,  in the world
 And I hope you found
 Whatever you were looking for.

 Wherever you are tonight,
 I wish you the best of everything,  in the world
 And I hope you found
 Whatever you were looking for.</lyrics>

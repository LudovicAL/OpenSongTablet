;Words and music by Sting

.C    G               Am       F
 Well someone told me yesterday
.C    G                   Am       F
 That when you throw your love away
.C   G             Am              F
 You act as if you  just don't care
.C   G                 Am             F
 You look as if you're going somewhere

.C   G               Am          F
 But I just can't convince myself
.C     G                  Am         F
 I.... couldn't live with no one else
.C   G          Am            F
 And I can only play that part
.C   G                Am          F
 And sit and nurse my broken heart

[C
.           C          G          Am        F
 So lonely, So lonely, So lonely,  So lonely
.C          G          Am        F
 So lonely, So lonely,  So lonely
.C          G         Am        F
 So lonely, So lonely  So lonely
.C          G         Am    F
 So lonely, So lonely  .... 
[

.C   G                Am          F
 Now no one's knocked upon my door
.C   G              Am           F
....For a thousand years or more
.C   G           Am           F
 All made up and nowhere to go
.C   G               Am          F
....Welcome to this one man show

.C    G                   Am         F
 Just take a seat they're always free
.C   G              Am     F
....No surprise no mystery
.C       G              Am          F
 In this theatre that I call my soul
.C     G               Am            F
 I.... always play the starring role 

;Chorus

;Guitar solo D - A - Bm - G

[C
.D          A          Bm        G
 So lonely, So lonely,  So lonely
.D          A          Bm        G
 So lonely, So lonely,  So lonely
.D          A          Bm        G
 So lonely, So lonely,  So lonely
.D          A          Bm        G
 So lonely, So lonely,  So lonely

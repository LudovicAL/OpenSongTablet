;Intro
.G  Em Am D7
 -- -- -- --

.    G
 The young ones
.                  Em
 darling we're the young ones
.        G
 and the young ones
.             Em
 shouldn't be afraid
.   G    D7
 to live love
.G                  C
 while the flame is strong
.         G              D7
 cause we may not be the young ones,
.     G
 very long

.  G
 Tomorrow
.                 Em
 Why wait until tomorrow
.        G
 cause tomorrow
.                Em
 sometimes never comes
.   G    D7
 so love me
.G                    C
 There's a song to be sung
.        G            D7
 and the best time to sing it
.               G     G7
 is while we're young .

[C
.C                      C
 Once in every life time
.G                     G
 comes a love like this
.    A7
 Oh, I need you, you need me
.D             D7
 Oh my darling can't you see
[

.    G
 The young dreams
.                  Em
 should be dreamed together
.          G
 The young hearts
.             Em
 shouldn't be afraid
.    G   D7
 And someday
.G                   C
 when the years have flown
.             G               D7
 darling then we'll teach the young ones
.       G   G7
 of our own .

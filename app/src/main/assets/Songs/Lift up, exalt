.E    B   C#m7 F#  A   C#m7 A      B
 Lift up, ex__alt, the name of the Lord
.E    B   C#m7 F#  A   C#m7 A      B
 Lift up, ex__alt, the name of the Lord
 
[V1]
.     C#m7             A
 Come kiss the Son, enthroned on high
.    E                 F#
 His splendour shines, like the dawn
.A                 C#m7
 When he speaks, creation shakes
.        F#                A  B
 All who love Him give Him praise
 
[V2]
 He makes a way where there is no way
 The seas will part, the mountains bow
 In Him we trust, in Him we hope
 In His might we will stand
 
[V3]
 Can you hear the sound of the coming rain
 Can you see the clouds, salvation comes
 There'll be songs of joy on our streets tonight
 Where death was, now there's life</lyrics>

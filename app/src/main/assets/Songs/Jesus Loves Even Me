. G
1 I am so glad that our Father in heaven
2 Tho' I forget Him and wander away,
3 O if there's only one song I can sing
. D7                        C       D7    G
1 Tells of His love in the  Book He has   given.
2 Still He doth love me wherever    I     stray.
3 When in His beauty I      see the great King,
. G
1 Wonderful things in my Bible I see-
2 Back to His dear, loving arms would I flee
3 This shall my song in eternity be:
. D7                        C     D7    G
1 This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.
2 When I remember that      Jesus loves me.
3 "O what a wonder, that    Jesus loves me!"

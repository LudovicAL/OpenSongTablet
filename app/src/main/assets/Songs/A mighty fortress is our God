.Bb              F          Eb          Bb            Gm        Bb       Eb F Bb
1 A mighty        fortress   is our      God, a        Bulwark   never    fa i ling;
2 Did we in       our own    strength confide, our     striving  would be lo   sing;
3 And though this world with devils      filled should threaten  to un    do   us;
4 That Word a     bove all   earthly     pow'r, no     thanks to them a   bid  eth;

. Bb           F         Eb        Bb           Gm       Bb        Eb F    Bb
1 Our Helper   He a      mid the   flood of     mortal   ills pre  va i    ling;
2 Were not the right Man on our    side, the    Man of   God's own choo    sing;
3 We will not  fear for  God hath  willed His   truth to triumph   through us:
4 The Spirit   and the   gifts are ours through Him who  with us   si      deth;

.     Gm        Csus C     F          Bb      Eb      Gm
1 For still our an   cient Foe doth   seek to work us woe;
2 Dost ask who  that may   be: Christ Jesus   it is   He;
3 The prince of dark ness  grim, we   tremble not for him;
4 Let goods and kin  dred  go, this   mortal  life al so;

.      Gm        Csus  C   F           Gm         Cm      D
1 His  craft and pow'r are great, and  armed with cruel   hate,
2 Lord Sabba     oth   His name, from  age to     age the same,
3 His  rage we   can   en  dure for    lo, his    doom is sure,
4 The  body      they  may kill; God's truth a    bideth  still,

.     Gm       Bb         Eb F Bb
1 On  earth is not his    e    qual.
2 And He must  win the    bat  tle.
3 One little   word shall fell him.
4 His kingdom  is for     e    ver!

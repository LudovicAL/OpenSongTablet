  <lyrics>[V1]
.        Gm
 When He rolls up His sleeves He ain't puttin' on the ritz
.    Cm7       Dm7     Gm
 Our God is an awesome God
.Dm7      Gm
 There is thunder in His footsteps and lightning in His fists
.    Cm7       Dm7     Gm 
 Our God is an awesome God 
.    Cm7
 The Lord wasn't joking when He kicked 'em out of Eden
.   Dm7
 It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood 
.    Eb                         Cm7
 His return is very soon so you better be believin'
.         Cm7       Dm7     Gm 
 That our God is an awesome God 

[C]
.    Eb        Bb 
 Our God is an awesome God
.   F          Gm 
 He reigns from heaven above 
.     Eb      Bb 
 With wisdom, power and love
.    Cm7       Dm7     Gm
 Our God is an awesome God!

[V2]
 And when the sky was starless in the void of the night
 Our God is an awesome God 
 He spoke into the darkness and created the light
 Our God is an awesome God
 Judgement and wrath He poured out on Sodom
 Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
 I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten
 That our God is an awesome God!

 When He rolls up His sleeves He ain't puttin' on the ritz
.    Fm7       Gm7     Cm
 Our God is an awesome God
.Gm7      Cm
 There is thunder in His footsteps and lightning in His fists

 Our God is an awesome God 
.    Fm7
 The Lord wasn't joking when He kicked 'em out of Eden
.   Gm7
 It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood 
.    Ab                         Fm7
 His return is very soon so you better be believin'

.   Bb          Cm 
 He reigns from heaven above 
.     Ab      Eb 
 With wisdom, power and love

 Our God is an awesome God!

[V2]
 And when the sky was starless in the void of the night
 Our God is an awesome God 
 He spoke into the darkness and created the light
 Our God is an awesome God
 Judgement and wrath He poured out on Sodom
 Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
 I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten
 That our God is an awesome God!

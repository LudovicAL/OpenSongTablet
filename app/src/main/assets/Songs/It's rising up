  <lyrics>[V1]
.     E
 It's rising up from coast to coast,
.                         C#m7    B
 From north to south, and east to west;
.    E
 The cry of hearts that love Your name,
.                        C#m7    B   E 
 Which with one voice we will proclaim.

[V2]
.    E    
 The former things have taken place,
.                    C#m7   B
 Can this be the new day of praise?
.  E
 A heav'nly song that comes to birth,
.                   C#m7    B
 And reaches out to all the earth

[P]
.   F#m7           E/G#               A                B
 Oh let the cry to nations ring,|That all may come and all may sing:

[C1]
. E    A      E                   B/Eb
 'Holy is the Lord'| (Every heart sing)
. C#m7 A      B                      A/C#
 'Holy is the Lord'| (With one voice sing)
. E    A      E                     B/Eb
 'Holy is the Lord'| (All the earth sing)
. C#m7 A      B     A/C#  E    
 'Holy is the Lord'

[V3]
 And we have heard the lion's roar,|That speaks of heaven's love and power.
 Is this the time, is this the call|That ushers in Your kingdom rule?
[P]
 Oh let the cry to nations ring,|That all may come and all may sing:

[C2]
 'Jesus is alive'|  (Every heart sing)
 'Jesus is alive'|  (With one voice sing)
 'Jesus is alive'|  (All the earth sing)
 'Jesus is alive'

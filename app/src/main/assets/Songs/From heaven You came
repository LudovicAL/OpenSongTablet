;Last 2 lines of chorus

[V1]
.Cm              G/B            Ab
 From heaven You came, helpless babe,
.Bb/Ab       Eb/G        Ab/C Eb/Bb Bb
 Entered our world, Your glo__ry    veiled;
.Cm        G/B           Ab
 Not to be served but to serve,
.Bb/Ab         Eb/G      Ab/C Eb/Bb Bb
 And give Your life that we   might live.

[C]
.Bb   Bb/Ab  Eb Bb7         Cm   Cm/Bb
 This is our God, the Servant King,
.            Ab     Bb7 Ab/Bb Eb  Bb7
 He calls us now to fol_low   Him,
.             Eb         Eb7/Db    Ab/C D
 To bring our lives as a daily offering
.           Eb Bb7         Eb   Dm7 G7  (Ab Bb7 to repeat Chorus)
 Of worship to the Servant King.

;Quiet verse
[V2]
 There in the garden of tears,
 My heavy load He chose to bear;
 His heart with sorrow was torn,
 'Yet not my will, but Yours', He said.

[V3]
 Come see His hands and His feet,
 The scars that speak of sacrifice,
 Hands that flung stars into space,
 To cruel nails surrendered.

[V4]
 So let us learn how to serve,
 And in our lives enthrone Him;
 Each other's needs to prefer,
 For it is Christ we're serving.

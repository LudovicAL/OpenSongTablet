  <lyrics>[V1]
.      Cm7                         F7
 As we come with praise before His majesty,
.        Cm7                    Fm    G
 We will celebrate with joy and victory,
.        Cm7                       F7
 For the Lord has come and set His people free,
.       Cm Cm7/Bb Ab6 G7       Cm  Fm
 We are marching  on  with Him,
.G          Cm      Fm G
 He's our deliverer.     (repeat)

[V2]
.    Cm                           F7     G
 The two-edged sword is sharpened in our hand.
.   Cm7                      Fm        G
 We come with vengeance to possess our land.
.   Cm                        F7          G
 We bind the kings because of God's right hand,
.    Cm    G/B     Cm7/Bb   C7/Bb     Fm  Ab7 G
 And carry out the sentence that  our God has planned.

[V3]
.      Cm7                         F7
 As we come with praise before His majesty,
.        Cm7                    Fm    G
 We will celebrate with joy and victory,
.        Cm7                       F7
 For the Lord has come and set His people free,
.       Cm Cm7/Bb Ab6 G7       Cm  Fm
 We are marching  on  with Him,
.G          Cm      Fm G            Cm      Fm G
 He's our deliverer,     He's our deliverer,
.G          Cm      Fm G            Cm
 He's our deliverer,     He's our deliverer. </lyrics>

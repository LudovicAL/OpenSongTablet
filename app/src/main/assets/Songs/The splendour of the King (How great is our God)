.    A                      F#m7
 The splendour of the King, clothed in majesty,
.                    D2
 Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice
.   A                           F#m7
 He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide
.                    D2
 And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice
 
[C]
.    A                          E/G#
 How great is our God, sing with me,
.    F#m7                       E/G#
 How great is our God, all will see
.    Dmaj7      E            A  Asus A
 How great, how great is our God
 
[V2]
.A                         F#m7
 Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
.                  D2
 Beginning and the end, beginning and the end
.    A                      F#m7
 The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
.                 D2
 The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb
 
[B]
.A                    E/G#
 Name above all names,
.F#m7                E/G#
 Worthy of all praise,
.   Dmaj7
 My heart will sing
.    E            A  Asus A
 How great is our God</lyrics></song>

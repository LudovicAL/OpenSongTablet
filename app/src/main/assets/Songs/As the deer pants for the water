  <lyrics>[V1]
.D      A/C#       Bm      G
 As the deer pants for the water,
.      Em         A7    D
 So my soul longs after You.
.     A/C#        Bm        G
 You alone are my heart's desire
.      Em7     A7      D
 And I long to worship You.

[C]
.Bm  Bm7/A        G            D
 You alone are my strength, my shield,
.   G                Em     F#
 To You alone may my spirit yield.
.D    A/C#        Bm        G
 You alone are my heart's desire
.      Em7     A7      D
 And I long to worship You.

[V2]
 I want You more than gold or silver,
 Only You can satisfy.
 You alone are the real joy-giver
 And the apple of my eye.

[V3]
 You're my Friend and You are my Brother,
 Even though You are a King.
 I love You more than any other,
 So much more than anything.</lyrics>

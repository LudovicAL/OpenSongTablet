.E (riff)      A         E (riff)     A           
 
[V1]
.       E             B/Eb                C#m           B                     A    
 He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High,|He will rest in the shadow of Him,
.      E/G#            F#m             E/G#         A             B
 The Almighty. He's my refuge, He's my fortress,|My God in whom I trust.
 
[V2]
 Surely He will protect me from the snare,|From the net of death and fear,
 In His wings I will find refuge, and protection,|Your name will be my shield.
 
[C]
.  E             A                E             A
 Because of Your love for me,|You rescue and protect me Lord
.       C#m                A                B      A
 When I speak Your name, I call, You answer me.
.         E             A               E              A
 You will be with me in trouble,|Your deliverance I'll see
.         C#m                   A             B      A
 All your blessings in my life, Lord, I daily see.  
 
[V3]
 I'll not fear the terror of the night,| or the arrow that flies by the day,
 You're my comfort, You sustain me, in the darkness,|My Lord, watch over me.
 
[V4]
 In the fight, though a thousand may fall at my side,|And ten thousand at my right hand,
 You will save me, Mighty Saviour, and Deliverer,|The battle will be Yours
 
[B]
.     B                A                  E/G#             A
 If I make the Lord my dwelling place, no harm may fall on me
.      B             A                 D             B
 To be daily in Your presence, to live daily by Your Word</lyrics>

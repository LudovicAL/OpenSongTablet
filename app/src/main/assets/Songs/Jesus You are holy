.E             B             E    E7
 Jesus You are holy, You are glorious
.        A             C#m         B
 You are worthy of all praise, all praise
.E             B             E ( E7/G# )
 Jesus You are holy, You are glorious
.        A             C#m         B
 You are worthy of all praise, all praise
.          A (Gadd9)
 All of my praise... all of my praise
 
[V1]
.E                B
 You have seen me in the darkness
.E        A       B       E
 You have covered me with light
.E               B
 Rescued me from sin and fire
.  E          A     B      E
 Behold! Your glory now in sight.
 
[V2]
 You have taken my disease and
 You have healed me with your blood
 Joy and sorrow deeply mingled
 Yes, the glory of the cross</lyrics></song>

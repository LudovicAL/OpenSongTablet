  <lyrics>[C]
.       Dm          G         C        F
 El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Elyonna Adonai,
.       Bb                   E7           Am    G/B    A/C#
 Age to age You're still the same, by the power of the name.
.       Dm          G         C       F
 El Shaddai, El Shaddai, erkamkana Adonai,
.        Bb                  G     Gsus   C
 We will praise and lift You high, El Shaddai.

[V1]
.             Dm                   G                  C          F
 Through Your love and through the ram, You saved the son of Abraham,
.            Bb            E7                  Am   G/B     A/C#
 Through the power of Your hand You turned the sea into dry land.
.       Dm             G                 C              F
 To the outcast on her knees You were the God who really sees,
.    Bb                G                 C    Csus C
 And by Your might You set Your children free.

[C]

[V2]
.            Dm                G              C                  F
 Through the years You made it clear that the time of Christ was near,
.           Bb              E7          Am   G/B      A/C#
 Though the people couldn't see what Messiah ought to be.
.            Dm                 G               C              F
 Though Your Word contained the plan, they just could not understand,
.          Bb               G           Bb  (slow)      G
 Your most awesome work was done in the frailty of Your Son.

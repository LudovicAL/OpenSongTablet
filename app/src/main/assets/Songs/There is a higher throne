  <lyrics>[V1]
 There is a higher throne
 Than all this world has known
 Where faithful ones from every tongue
 Before the Son we’ll stand
 Made faultless through the lamb
 Believing hearts find promised grace
 Salvation comes

[V2]
 Hear heaven’s voices sing
 Their thunderous anthem rings
 Through emerald courts and sapphire skies
 Their praises rise
 All glory wisdom power
 Strength thanks and honour are
 To God our King who reigns on high
 Forever more

[V3]
 And there we’ll find our home
 Our life before the throne
 We’ll honour Him in perfect song
 Where we belong
 He’ll wipe each tear-stained eye
 As thirst and hunger die
 The lamb becomes our Shepherd King
 We’ll reign with Him
</lyrics></song>

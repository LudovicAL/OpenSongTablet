    // Fix music score popup window
    // Dragging set items breaks highlighted item

    // Update text in presenter mode not working for second screen
    // SongSelect only recognising Chord pages (not score?)
    // Presenter mode not working with pdf/images

    // Occasional bugs harder to replicate/solve
    // Crash when fast scrolling to bottom of song list sometimes indexexception (I think when it gets updated after indexing)
    // Exporting pdfs sometimes stops at the last item and doesn't open up share option

    // TODO strings that reference stuff that was used before and probably should be
    // update_projector_automatically
    // presoFontShadow
    // editpdf


    //TODO - still to complete
    // Anything still listed below needs work
    // Anything missing has been tested as okay

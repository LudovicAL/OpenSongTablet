    // Check persistent database import with overwrite on/off
    // Check nearby receive prev/next page for PDF
    // Check pedal listeners
    // Fully implement image slides and images in all modes

    // Image slides autoadvance and loop in presenter mode (maybe stage mode too?)
    // Alignment of images and slides in secondary dislplay to match lyrics align


    // BUGS FROM LIVE TEST

    // SongSelect only recognising Chord pages (not score?)
    // Presenter mode not working with images

    // Occasional bugs harder to replicate/solve
    // Crash when fast scrolling to bottom of song list sometimes indexexception (I think when it gets updated after indexing)

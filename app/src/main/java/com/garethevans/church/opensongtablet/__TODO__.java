public class __TODO__ {

    // Connected display settings in menu and presenter mode

    // Still to implement pedal previous next confirm

    // Presenter mode - almost everything!!

    // Variations

    // TODO strings that reference stuff that was used before and probably should be
    // update_projector_automatically
    // stage_section_max
    // song_name_already_taken
    // pad_off
    // presoFontShadow
    // keepmultiline
    // editpdf

    //TODO - still to complete
    // Anything still listed below needs work
    // Anything missing has been tested as okay
    /*

Bugs:
Changing autoscroll (and probably other) values of pdf corrupts the file - likely overwriting it
opening a song when in the set menu doesn't scroll to it



    The following menus still need completed

    Display - song display / advanced - needs ProcessSong brought fully online
    Display - connected display (HDMI/Chromecast output) - needs SecondScreen working

    Song actions - Chords, do I need chord for H?
    Song actions - ABC notation
    Song actions - MIDI
    Song actions - Import songs - online - some working, some not
    Song actions - Import songs - file
    Song actions - Import songs - iOS
    Song menu action button - show song actions
    Song menu action button - find new songs

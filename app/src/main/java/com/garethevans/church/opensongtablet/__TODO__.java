    // Presenter mode - almost everything!!

    // Variations

    // TODO strings that reference stuff that was used before and probably should be

Bugs:
Changing autoscroll (and probably other) values of pdf corrupts the file - likely overwriting it
opening a song when in the set menu doesn't scroll to it

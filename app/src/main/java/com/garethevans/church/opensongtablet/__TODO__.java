    // Check persistent database import with overwrite on/off
    // Check nearby receive prev/next page for PDF
    // Fully implement image slides and images in all modes

    // Alignment of images and slides in secondary dislplay to match lyrics align
    // Add option of time and loop for custom text slideshow, not just imageslideshow in presenter mode

    // BUGS FROM LIVE TEST
    // SongSelect only recognising Chord pages (not score?)
    // Presenter mode not working with images

    // Occasional bugs harder to replicate/solve
    // Crash when fast scrolling to bottom of song list sometimes indexexception (I think when it gets updated after indexing)

    // For future
    // Exporting sets that aren't loaded in currently can't include custom slides *shows doesn't exists warning

    // BUGS FROM LIVE TEST
    // Last item in set list (or song list) doesn't swipe backwards to previous
    // Variations in sets not working properly
    // I think that ' are stripped from the variation filename
    // Updating variation to song with preferred key didn't seem to update the set list (saved)
    // When going to save set it sometimes came up with a suggested filename of the old loaded set, or the first set item name
    // Set 1 (note) showing as Set%201 (html/url encoded)
    // Not checked how variations work when using Nearby on receiving device

    // Still to implement pedal previous next confirm

    // Presenter mode - almost everything!!

    // TODO strings that reference stuff that was used before and probably should be
    // update_projector_automatically
    // presoFontShadow
    // keepmultiline
    // editpdf

    // Creating a new set doesn't untick songs in the song menu

    // Exporting pdfs sometimes stops at the last item and doesn't open up share option
    // Add song to set (long press) breaks (out of bounds)

    //TODO - still to complete
    // Anything still listed below needs work
    // Anything missing has been tested as okay
    /*
